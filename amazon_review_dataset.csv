"OnePlus has outdone itself this time, delivering a smartphone that truly lives up to its legacy as a flagship killer. After using it for a week, here are my ratings:  1. Design: 10/10 The slim, boxy design with a matte black finish feels premium and elegant. The in-hand feel is exceptional.  2. AI: 10/10 Packed with all the latest AI features, it’s both innovative and intuitive.  3. OS: 9/10 The return of OxygenOS is a brilliant move! While there are a few bloatware apps, OxygenOS 15 is lightning-fast and smooth.  4. Camera: 9/10 While not flagship-level, the camera performs impressively, capturing excellent detail in most scenarios.  5. Battery: 10/10 The silicon battery is a game-changer, offering 10-11 hours of screen-on time with moderate use—simply outstanding.  6. Processor: 10/10 The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 delivers optimized, power-efficient performance that feels seamless.  7. Display: 10/10 The display is breathtaking—vivid, sharp, and a delight to use.  Overall, OnePlus 13R is a powerhouse and offers unbeatable value for its price.  Conclusion: The OnePlus 13R is a masterclass in balancing performance, design, and innovation at a competitive price. With its sleek design, cutting-edge AI features, impressive battery life, and smooth performance, it redefines what a flagship killer should be. While the camera isn't quite flagship-level, it holds its own in most scenarios. If you're looking for a phone that offers premium features without breaking the bank, the OnePlus 13R is the one to beat.",POSITIVE
"A powerhouse of performance and style! ✨ The stunning display is captivating, and the camera delivers crisp, vibrant photos. Gaming is smooth as butter, thanks to its blazing-fast processor. Battery life easily lasts all day, and charging is super quick. Definitely a top contender in its price range!",POSITIVE
"No phone can be rated 5 out of 5. At the best 4.5 would be possible with something or the other falling short.. Oneplus 13R has many great things under it's hood but half heartedly done to retain the difference between R and the non R phone.  A. Positives.  1. Display. Excellent and flat display. No concerns as it now comes with life time warranty for green line issues, if any and if at all which is a great peace of mind considering Oneplus would honour it. Supports Dolby vision, HDR +. The display is bright, clear and crisp. The under display optical finger print sensor is placed lower closer to the bottom bezel failing to the ergonomic placement. It could have been an inch above. However, no issues with it's operations. Quite quick but not as fast and quick as ultra sonic sensor. 2. Processor. Excellent. No lags and no hiccups. (I am not into gaming but i know this would fare well based on my experience with S24 Ultra. Note that there would be heating felt upon prolonged heavy app use. However, this SoC would serve well for several years with new android updates. Now with Oneplus offering 4 plus 6 years SW update policy this is future proof hardware. 3. Sound. Ok, the stereo sound is decent and loud enough but there's evident distortion over 90 percent volume setting. Bass isn't very evident. Also Dolby Atmos is now not available. Otherwise it's a proper stereo sounding speakers. 4. RAM, Storage and Communication. Excellent specs with DDR5 and UFS 4.0. With base version starting at 12GB/256GB it's more than enough for most users. It is however let down with USB 2.0 post that limits transfer speeds but then it's something that wouldn't bother to most people who wouldn't be transferring data to and fro from other devices. IP protection is IP65 which is fine but IP 68 is a common thing at these prices especially from chinese phone makers. Haptics are tight but weak. A little more stronger motor would have been perfect. 5. Battery. Excellent. Anything between 7 to 10 hours of SOT can easily be had from this phone. A proper full day battery unless you are into gaming all the day. I use 50 percent for my use case which involves social media, few camera photos and browsing with about 4 hours of SOT. Calling drains faster than multimedia watching which probably needs to be rectified with future updates. Some carrier bands seems to have been removed, however I didn't have any issues with calling or internet on my 4G airtel SIM. There's no wireless charging though. 6. Call quality Very good and clear. No issues at either end..signal reception is also good.  B. Negatives. 1. Software This is Color OS 15 which is slightly modified as Oxygen OS 15. It's super smooth and slick with lots of customizations possible. But still it's no where near Samsung One UI which is far superior, functional and feature rich than Oxygen OS 15. Also Oneplus added few bloatwares like Phone manager, Phone pick and few other apps. Luckily, you can either uninstall them or disable them. Interestingly, as an example the biggest overlooked setting is you can chose when to enter Power saving mode but you can come out of it only when you charge it till 90 percent. This is something that's silly and Oneplus must automatically disable power saving mode once the battery crosses it's trigger point. There are couple of such thoughtless things in Oxygen OS 15 which should be rectified. There's also nothing like Routines which Samsung offers on their S and A series for phone automation tasks. 2. Cameras Some changes are positive but half hearted. Something like adding a telephoto 2X instead of macro which is such a welcome move, but then this lens has no OIS. UW 8 MP is just passable in daylight. In day light both main and 2X give good quality photos however low light performance is much to be desired. 3X with OIS would be more practical as such. Video on this phone is even more compromised with 4K limited to main sensor. All other sensors are capped at 1080P. In the front 16 MP camera is again okish for photos and handicapped for videos capped at 1080, 30 FPS which is a bummer. Overall Oneplus could have done better with the cameras but it seems like they intentionally subdued R series more to differentiate it with the pricier Oneplus 13 rather than on pricing front. 3. AI There are few AI features in photos, notes etc..but frankly they don't work as seamlessly or effectively as what can be seen on my S24U from Samsung. Oneplus has a long way to go in this aspect. Right now it's more gimmicky.  My last Oneplus phone was 3T post which I switched to Samsung S series. No doubt S series, especially Ultra is leagues ahead both hardware and software but when it comes to value for money Oneplus 13 series does shine. Moreso with their introductory pricing and offers. Yes some of the above shortcomings could have been included at this price point, but stills it's a safe bet and a promising phone for years of use with the kind of hardware and SW you get from Oneplus. I would recommend the Oneplus 13R phone under 40K for its hardware and revised SW update policy.",NEGATIVE
Surprisingly good product for the price. I have generally purchased the flagship phones of OnePlus with the assumption that they are better than the Nord-series. I now stand corrected. The NORD CE range is definitely an economical range and not meant for heavy usage but the Nord series are more than capable of taking on heavy usage. The camera is not great but at the price point it is more than adequate. The phone is well built and looks good. The finger print reader is quick and efficient. Phone functionality being almost bare bones androrid is high on user friendliness. A definite buy!,POSITIVE
"Bought the phone a month ago. Safe to say at this price range, for me, it's banger. A fast and smooth software experience and tough and durable hardware.  The oxygen os 15 update made the software smoother and brought some cool features as well. Battery gives an excellent backup, charges quick, the display is great and flat. Also the metal design is unique.  The only downside, or might i say, a slight disappointment is the camera. Not that good at this price. Still and over-all great one. Not even noticeable to the average user. Apart from that, One plus nailed it.",POSITIVE
"This is my first OnePlus device, before this iam user of poco believe me oxygen OS is far better than miui/ Hyper os. It's lag free,and very smoothly work, battery is al great, camera is not upto mark but ok. Performance is next level iam loving with it😎",POSITIVE
"I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4. It is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. I bought this phone during Great Indian festival after so much research and doubts. I was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. I was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. I don't want to compromise in any one thing. So after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. But in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. Curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. Now i feel it was the best decision. Best features of this Nord 4 are- Design - I literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. I thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. It cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all. Performance - It has the best performance and able to play BGMI so smoothly. Flat screen helps so much in games also. Battery - If you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins. Camera - I felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. If camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, Samsung or Iphone which are camera centric. But then other areas you have to compromise. Trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos. Network - Being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. Never felt any Issues at all. Display - It has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.  This review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for Oneplus Nord 4 for sure. Greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....  (If any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)",POSITIVE
"I've never had a OnePlus device before so I'll be totally unbiased over my experience for this phone since I bought it by the time of of first day launch🤗  1) Design: (9.5/10 Subjective) I love it but t's subjective is you prefer a glass built over a metal or the dual tone colours/texture appeals you less or more, but ultimately it's one of the most eye catching designs launched this year apart from the Nothing phones that has managed to attain a premium appearance in a very simple unibody structure.  2) Performance: (8.5/10) This is what makes it one of the top competitors within the 30k lineup phones. I personally play a lot of gatcha games like Genshin, Honkai and Wuthering Waves, over fps shooting so I would definitely say that gatcha games being heavier in graphics, Nord 4 is capable to provide the most efficient gaming. Practically speaking if you avoid those YouTube reviews with AnTuTu, any android phone would at some point face fps drop if you play in the highest settings and I do believe with what I've heard that even with high end processors like Snapdragon 7+ 3, OnePlus always limits it's potential which is why we do get to see some throttling, but on a long term it doesn't matter. If you are a daily user with 2-3 hours of heavy gaming per day or more with breaks after every 45 minutes to 1 hour of heavy graphic gameplay, then you could definitely have a great experience. If you are just a normal user, you can choose it blindly.  3) Built and UI: (9/10 for strength and quality but 7/10 for being expensive to replace) Ofcourse being metal you would expect a little bit of weight (around 200 grams) but you get used to it and it really feels much premium to feel that metallic weight in your hand. It might get really slippery and if it falls down it might not have scratches except for the glass portion around the camera but might face dents on the metal if the fall is too harsh, so I would suggest to have a back cover, and let's be honest no matter how premium the phone is even if it looks great, they are all at the end of the day sensitive and how you manage to care for it depends totally on you. Be responsible. And as I mentioned, it's going to be really expensive to replace a unibody metal frame if it's cracked or dented even if it's strong enough to work so be careful. As for the UI I've been a Xiaomi user so honestly I don't feel much different in terms of operating system with bloatware, but I really don't feel bothered by it as long as I'm able to disable it. I uninstalled and disabled not almost but EVERY single bloatware in this phone that I possibly could have including app market and even the gaming tool so now I don't get those security checks after installing apps and it feels as clean as any Flagship phone.  3) Battery: (8/10) It's good. Definitely better battery life than my iPhone BUT for how big the battery is, the Oxygen OS hasn't optimised it's battery life to it's maximum just as I mentioned before for its Processor but it's not a big deal. 5500mAH is something we see less as the price goes higher over handheld devices because they try to add more space for gimmicks like wireless charging which in my opinion is not very practical everytime unless you carry a wireless charger everywhere and they are really slow. But the wired charging in OnePlus with the 100 watt out of the box charger is great and it charges the device to full within 30 minutes tho I would suggest to toggle the option from Battery Health settings to charge it till 80 percentage so you can keep it's battery health stable for long. I hope they optimise it in the future updates but honestly it gives you around 7-8 hours of life with regular usage and even more if you are a light user which is more than enough considering that at some point you will need to charge your device any way.  4) Display: (8/10) It's a very smooth 120hz amoled panel with HDR support in Netflix that I never really use because I watch on my MacBook or the television (it's just better to watch anything on a bigger display over a phone to keep your visions safe) and an unnamed protection (Panda glass according to few sources) but I'll be practical over how much it actually matters. Being someone who has changed the displays in the past after getting it broken, it doesn't matter what Gorilla glass they put on your phone, it's a glass at the end of the day and if you are not being responsible enough by handling your phone with care, it's expected for your screen to face damage. Use a good tempered glass around 3-4 USD (200-400 INR) I won't suggest to go higher because no matter how expensive it is, even if it's able to handle a bend test, practically any tempered display is penetrable if it falls flat on a rough surface UNLESS you have a good thick back cover. Overall it's a good display but I feel that the brightness could be a bit bother outside if you live in a heavily bright environment. Personally I didn't face any issues for the time being as the peak brightness is really good in the sunlight but if you compare it to some cheaper devices, it might feel a little less.  5) Heating Stabilization: (9/10) I mean, it's metal? Ofcourse it's going to be hot DURING a gameplay but HEATING DOESN'T MEAN PERFORMANCE DROP. Also it's during the time when you are playing or doing some heavy task but the best part of metal is that it cools down as fast as it heats up and the cooling chamber in this phone is really efficient. Overall It's definitely better in terms of heat stabilization than any glass/plastic built phones for being a metal although I would say that, if you are travelling in a constantly hot temperature, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight for too long as it might get hot or else again, Use a back cover. BUT I'd also suggest to not use a back cover when doing some heavy gaming because it makes you loose the purpose of having a metal phone with such a good heating stabilization as plastic makes it harder to escape the heat.  6) Camera: (7/10 Subjective) This isn't my place but I would still give some opinion. It is decent and when I say that, it is actually not bad at all infact really good along it's limitations. It has a very natural tone on the back camera with a really good potrait mode and a decent front camera definitely better than a 25k phone but ofcourse with the specifications you see, there are limitations if you compare it to other phones in the same price. It's definitely better than Nothing 2a in terms of color and stability but not as close to camera centred phones like Vivo/Realme in the midrange but then again those phones lack either performance or the brand value, as OnePlus is much premium as a brand than Vivo/Realme even if they are from the same company. Again it is subjective and this phone in my opinion is rather a balance of performance along with the things you need in a midrange close-to-flagship phone rather than being an entire camera phone, but it's still really good even with the limitations of telephoto and other things that I find gimmick because I'm not a camera phone user.  Overall: (8.25) It's a great phone for both everyday users and decent to heavy gamers. I might score it higher in the future if they successfully optimise the Operating system in the future updates and push it to 9 even with a decent camera because this phone has a lot of potential and considering it's future update promises of 4+6 for Android and security patch, it's a very good purchase. Just praying that these phones don't face any green line issues in the future.",POSITIVE
"With CC discount, got it for a great bargain price. could not ask for more. Elegant, premium look. Wonderful camera, UI is also good. using it since 10 days, yet to explore many features.

"Been using it for the last month, really goor battery timing, handy fast charging feature, camera works really well for daily use, especially for videgraphy. Overall satisfied with the purchase.  Looks wise 10 out of 10, loved the metal build.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M05 for just under INR 6500, and I must say, I am very impressed! For the price, this phone is an absolute steal and offers incredible value for money.  The large display is a real highlight, providing a great viewing experience for day-to-day tasks. Despite being a budget phone, it has a premium feel in hand, which is a pleasant surprise. The build quality is solid, and it doesn’t feel cheap.  Battery life is outstanding! It lasts all day with moderate use, and I don’t have to worry about charging frequently. Whether you're browsing the web, checking social media, or streaming videos, it gets the job done efficiently.  While it's not a phone meant for heavy tasks like gaming or intensive apps, it excels at handling basic jobs like calling, texting, browsing, and light media consumption. It's perfect if you're looking for a reliable phone for everyday use without breaking the bank.  Overall, I’m really happy with my purchase. If you're looking for a budget phone that does the essentials really well, the Samsung Galaxy M05 is an excellent choice!",POSITIVE
All I can say it's worth it considering that Price  You can't expect High range Performance in 7k Budget mobiles  Let's talk About Mobile - Big Screen Looks good - Build-in Quality is Good - Battery is Good - Camera Quality Below Avg they said 50mp expected more but it's below avg - Processing is Above Avg  It's good for Normal Use not for heavy use,POSITIVE
"Thankyou so much Amazon India to buy my dream smartphone of our doorstep . Product is good, Delivery person is good and helpful behaviour activity, Perfect price of all retail smartphone shop , easy handling .",POSITIVE
"Processor- Slow processor but i guess you cant ask for much in this price bracket, the UI is smooth most of the time and its good enough to use social media apps and to watch videos and all  Camera- Not very good but well we cant ask for much in this price range.  Screen- Its actually really good for normal day to day usage, the colours and the sharpness is very decent, i dont like the inclusion of thick bezels but i guess again its the price segment so cant ask for much, viewing angles are kinda bad  Battery- will last you a whole day if you try, it couldve been better tho  Build- Its solid, yes it makes the phone heavy and bulky but yeah its solid and has a good in hand feeling",POSITIVE
"I've been using this Samsung phone for a bit, and here's the lowdown. Considering it costs around ₹6,500-₹7,000, I think it's a pretty great deal.  Sure, there are some compromises. No fingerprint sensor (the face unlock compensates some what for that), and yeah, not having a charger in the box is a bit of a hassle if you don't already have one. The speakers could be better, and a Full HD display would've been nice.  But let's be real, at this price point, you can't expect perfection. If you're like me and just need a reliable phone for everyday stuff – calls, texts, social media, and some streaming – this phone gets the job done. Gaming enthusiasts might want to look elsewhere, but for casual users, I think this Samsung device is a solid choice.  Would I recommend? Absolutely, for basic usage.",POSITIVE

It may not be revolutionary, but it delivers solid value for everyday use.",POSITIVE
My review : Performance [ 4/5 ] - Gaming Performance good but you'll see some frame drops and lag somewhere while using but a great gaming experience at this price. Camera [ 3/5 ] - Very limit features in camera app and quality is also not good and you'll find better options in market at 20k. Battery [ 5/5 ] - Awesome battery life and 80w fast charging is crazy and will take about 40m-60m for 0-100%. Display [ 4.5/5 ] - Good display quality in this price segment. Software [ 4/5 ] - Somewhere a decent ui experience but if you are looking for a good ui then Samsung ofc will be the best option. Conclusion - If you are looking for a phone for normal use and don't use camera that much then it's a great choice but OnePlus as a company is not offering you something special if you buy at by seeing their brand value and it's quite similar to Realme Mobiles.,NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:  Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.  Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.  Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.  Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.  Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.  Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.  In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.",POSITIVE
Camera quality: very good Charging speed: very fast Fingerprint reader: very quicky Weight: light weight Heating issue: didn't tried gaming so not sure about high level performance but for normal use it is not heating at all,NEGATIVE
"I purchased it for my sister, she is not a heavy user. She uses it for pictures, social media and youtube mostly. So She is happy with this mobile. It looks sleek, and colour also matches India’s current political situation 😊. Camera is satisfactory. Battery is long lasting which is nice to have. 5g woks excellent. So overall it’s a nice phone. I got it on discount so keep an eye out",POSITIVE
Pros: Good battery backup Decent camara in well light condition Cons: Poor processer and performance Worest photos in low light condition Faced lack in finer print sensor Finally not worthy under 20k segment Best option is Poco x7 comparing with this.,NEGATIVE
"OnePlus are the very best manufacturers of mobile devices, bar none.",POSITIVE

"The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G offers an attractive package, especially for users seeking solid performance at a budget-friendly price. Here’s a closer look at its key aspects:  Design and Display:  The Aqua Flow variant looks sleek with its gradient finish, adding a touch of elegance. The phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, making it easy for one-handed use. Its 6.58-inch Full HD+ display is sharp and vibrant, offering good color reproduction and brightness for media consumption. Though not AMOLED, the display performs well in outdoor lighting conditions and provides smooth scrolling with a 120Hz refresh rate.  Performance:  Powered by the Dimensity 6300 5G chipset, this device ensures a snappy and fluid user experience. It handles multitasking well, although the 4GB RAM might struggle slightly with heavier apps and games when compared to 6GB or 8GB variants. For regular usage like social media, video streaming, and casual gaming, the phone performs admirably. The inclusion of 5G support is a strong future-proofing move, especially at this price point.  Camera:  The 50MP Sony AI Camera setup is one of the phone’s strongest features. It takes good-quality pictures in daylight with sharp details and vivid colors. However, low-light performance could be better, as images tend to get noisy in dim environments. The AI optimizations, such as scene recognition, enhance the photography experience, making it easy to capture decent shots with minimal effort. The front camera is decent for selfies and video calls, though not exceptional.  Battery and Charging:  The phone packs a 5000mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day of moderate use. The charger in the box is a nice touch, offering fast charging support that gets the phone charged in under two hours. Battery optimization is good, ensuring you won’t run out of juice during regular day-to-day tasks.  Storage and Software:  With 128GB of storage, there’s ample room for apps, media, and files, and the phone supports microSD expansion if needed. The software experience is clean and customizable with iQOO’s Funtouch OS, which runs smoothly on Android. The UI is user-friendly, though there are some pre-installed apps that may not be necessary, but they can be uninstalled.  Verdict:  The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G is a competitive mid-range smartphone with solid performance, 5G support, a reliable camera, and good battery life. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly 5G phone with a stylish design, it’s a solid pick, but the 4",POSITIVE
"I am reviewing this after fully used and drop, ip test with pros and cons. If you want a phone with great performance, decent Camara also with latest Android 14 under 12k this phone will be perfect.. Best things are it's comes with Android 14 with funtouch os (if you are previously Vivo user you will got this) which is a great experience for me as 1st time user. On these segment its comes with 50 mp Sony IMX sensor 😘 with popular modes like slomo, which is really appreciated for budget lovers.. It's also supported 2k resolution with no lag..🤩 You will get 6gb ram with auto booster and 128 gb variant under 12k, it's a massive storage on budget..🤗 Ip64 with dust resistant, I have compared with other phones on this budget they have ip54 with no dust resistant feature..😄 This are the main points that I liked much, also I liked the wifi 5, fingerprint it's really fast with no animation, less bloat apps, ultra game mode etc..😉 Let's see the cons that I've got..😑🥴 Charging watt should be better at least 20 watts with inbox charger, 10 watt charger comes with it but the phone is supported 25 watt fast charging.. but 5000mah is good for long lasting uses.. charging time 5-80% was 1.15 hrs with inbox charger. Display should be comes with at least type IPS, it's comes with LCD display and decent colour gamut and 90hz gives most of all other phones on these budget. 1080p display will be much appreciated.. Design is good but if you have seen the poco c61 design that is comes with new radial cam design, so it's a disappointed because that's a under 7k phone..😆 Animation uses cause phone slower than usual..bso I will suggest not to use that..  Overall seen, decent Camera and Design, great performance (I will suggest to buy 6gb variant) with 5g variant, full day battery backup (for less gamers), IP64 with dust resistant 😍, latest Android 14 with 2 years of major upgrades and 3 years of security updates, handy weight with silicon cover on box.. Overall good on these budget segment with trust of VIVO.. 🫶",NEGATIVE
Good working,POSITIVE
"Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.  Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.  Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.  If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.  I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.  They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.  Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.  For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: - Great battery backup. With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone. - Camera quality at this price is way above average. - Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point. - One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations. - No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer. - Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.  Cons: - Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g. - Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated. - Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage. - There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates. - Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector. So, need to shell out extra money for these.",NEGATIVE
"Good budget phone. If you are looking for a decent phone from a trusted brand go for it . Good built quality, decent camera , clean UI . Also for people looking for a secondary android phone can go for this one .  Cons : No charger , no back cover comes with the box  Just to highlight : I am not a gamer and use mainly social media and streams apps . If you are gamer please go for a different device.",POSITIVE

"Good design, battery backup, customised UI, display, performance.  Camera is just okay.  Device weight is heavy. Which is complicate to handle.",NEGATIVE
The mobile is coming with a factory loaded login pin. This prevented me from loading Apps and start working. I have to visit a Samsung Authorised Service Center to remove the login pin. This has casued a lot of mental agony and inconvenience.,NEGATIVE
"The Samsung Galaxy M35 is a solid all-rounder, offering best-in-class display quality and reliable performance in the budget segment. Whether you’re a casual user or a basic gamer(not for pro), this phone has you covered.

"I've been using the realme Narzo N61 (Marble Black, 4GB RAM+64GB Storage) for a few weeks, and while it shows promise, it falls short in some areas.  Pros:  1. 90Hz Eye Comfort display: Smooth visuals, reduced eye strain. 2. IP54 dust and water resistance: Added durability. 3. 48-month fluency promise: realme's commitment to software updates. 4. Charger included: Convenient. 5. Affordable price point.  Cons:  1. Performance issues: Device can be slow, especially with multitasking. 2. Occasional lag and freezing: Frustrating experience. 3. Display touch issues: Unresponsive or inaccurate touch registration. 4. Limited storage (64GB): May require frequent cleaning or expansion.  Key Features:  - 6.5"" HD+ display - MediaTek Helio G35 processor - 4GB RAM, 64GB storage (expandable up to 1TB) - 48MP primary camera, 2MP macro, 2MP depth sensor - 5000mAh battery - Android 12 (Realme UI 3.0)  Verdict:  The realme Narzo N61 has potential, but its performance and display issues hold it back. If you prioritize smooth performance and responsive touch, consider alternatives.  Recommendation:  Ideal for:  - Basic users (calling, texting, social media) - Casual gaming (non-demanding titles)  Not recommended for:  - Demanding gamers - Multitaskers - Those seeking seamless performance  Rating Breakdown:  - Display: 3.5/5 (touch issues) - Performance: 3.0/5 (slow, laggy) - Battery: 4.0/5 - Camera: 3.5/5 - Value: 4.5/5  Suggestions for realme:  1. Optimize software for better performance. 2. Improve display touch sensitivity. 3. Consider upgrading storage options.  Would I recommend this product? Only for basic users.  Please note that this review is based on my personal experience. Your mileage may vary.",NEGATIVE
Best mobile in budget range,POSITIVE
Everything is great but has slow internet access like even in high speed wifi the phone can only access slow speeds with buffering internet and only useful for small tasks like social media cannot handle huge tasks like gaming. Screen size is gud. Sound quality could be better but it sounds ok with single speaker,POSITIVE
"It works well, battery backup is good stays for upto a day in normal usage, charging speed is also fast, little to no heating when used light, It is well and good for elderly people who need a phone for their usage, sound quality is fine.",POSITIVE
Nice product,POSITIVE
Nice mobile and great design,POSITIVE

"One word to describe phone... Excellent!!! This phone is superb android phone in this price range. Look wise, it feels premium and is very lightweight. Curved display is very elegant. After using for almost a year, I have zero regret. Camera quality is okish. Battery performance and display are extremely good. The only challenge is to find right screen guard. I initially struggled to find the right screen guard and put it on. However, later I find the perfect screenguard for the phone. Moreover, CPU and high usage doesn't impact it's graphics . The phone never hanged till date. The game performance is also very very nice. I loved this phone.",POSITIVE
"iQOO Z7 Pro 5G is powered by a 4nm processor, the phone is optimized for gaming and demanding tasks, providing efficient performance at this price point. Priced under ₹21,000, this device offers exceptional value with a blend of style and performance.  This smartphone offers an impressive gaming experience, delivering smooth performance with high graphics settings without any noticeable lags—even at critical battery levels as low as 1-5%. The gameplay remains consistent regardless of the charge percentage, ensuring uninterrupted performance.  In terms of connectivity, 5G support works flawlessly, ensuring a seamless network experience. A standout feature of the phone is its curved AMOLED display, which adds an element of sophistication and makes the design visually appealing.  One of the few drawbacks is the battery capacity, which is slightly limited compared to some competitors. However, the device compensates with fast charging support, taking approximately 1 hour and 5 minutes to reach full charge after one year of continuous usage—still a reasonable timeframe.  The camera performance is commendable, offering good results for both casual and advanced photography needs. Although the phone has only a single bottom-firing speaker, it provides satisfactory sound quality for basic usage. This minor limitation does not significantly impact the overall multimedia experience.  Pros:  Outstanding gaming performance with no lag, even at low battery levels Fast charging support (full charge in ~1 hour and 5 minutes) Curved AMOLED display adds a premium feel Smooth 5G connectivity Powerful 4nm processor optimized for gaming  Cons:  Limited battery capacity Single bottom speaker (though audio quality is adequate for everyday use)  Verdict: This smartphone stands out as an excellent choice under ₹21,000, balancing gaming performance, design aesthetics, and fast connectivity. If battery capacity isn't your top priority, it’s a highly recommended option for gamers and casual users alike.",POSITIVE
"After using this phn for past 3 months, I am writing this long time rivew, If you want to buy any phn Under 25K segment there is many option now , there is Moto edge 40Neo , Oneplus Nord CE3 , Realme 11 pro which are decent phones with 1 or 2 cons , It is upto you what is your top 3 preference, for me its Display ,Camera and Processor , Now coming to Iqoo Z7 pro , lets count it pros -  1. Display :- 6.78 inch beautiful Curved AMOLED 120Hz with 1300 nits peak brightness , Screen is very bright , punchy AMOLED colors , Smooth animation , fast UI , and no lagging or frame drop in my usage, also HDR Supported in Youtube Netflix ,Amazon everywhere . Moto Edge 40 Neo has also similar Curved AMOLED with small screen size of 6.55 inches , supports 144Hz and 1300 nits peak brightness with a punchy color science, and HDR only supported in YouTube, not in Netflix or amazon both Oneplus and Realme have peak brightness of only 900 nits and 950 nits respectively , which can be a issue in direct sunlight use , Nord CE 3 is flat AMOLED , not curved  2. Camera : Usually I don't believe in megapixels and numbers , you need a good Rear main camera (64MP OIS) and good front camera (16MP) , which it has , Z7 pro will give you very balanced picture with attractive Social media ready pictures and Best PORTRAIT mode pictures and Best NIGHT Mode pictures in this price range, yes Ultrawide camera is missing , but what will you do with those useless 8MP and 2 MP secondary cameras, if the main camera is not upto the mark , this phone is for my wife , she liked the Front camera also very much .If you love to shoot on Ultrawide camera then go for Edge 40 Neo or Nord CE 3 , Edge 40 neo rear camera is very very over saturated punchy colors , not everyone cup of tea , oneplus camera is also not very eye-catching, Portrait mode edge detection not perfect in any phone except Iqoo, very average camera quality in Oneplus, Megapixel is not everything you can realize after seeing that 100MP main camera in realme, it's very average , for Video every phone has max support upto 4K 30fps with OIS which helps in stable footage, here also Iqoo has the balanced output , Moto has that punchy Saturated colour science, every phone Front camera video support max to 1080p except Edge 40 neo which support 4K30fps , so choose accordingly.  3. Processor - Dimensity 7200 is a very fast processor (very near of Snapdragon 888 and Snapdragon 870) based on Mediatek's 4nm fabrication , which helps not only in Powerful gaming but also in battery consumption, for gamers I will recommend to watch youtube reviews before purchasing , because I did not tested any game, but for my Moderate to heavy use, i never faced any stuttering or heating or lagging , phone is very smooth , fast and responsive with 120Hz always enabled , if you keep refresh rate to auto switch then also it is very smooth. this processor keeps the phone very cool for its Liquid Cooling Vapour chamber.  4. Battery & Charging :- Yes, many people including me has hesitated for 4600mAh , but what a tremendous battery Optimization in this phone ,it will easily beat all the 5000mAh phones in this price range, maybe because of DM 7200 and it's 4nm process , In battery backup it will easily last for 1 day ( 7-8 hours screen on time) in my moderate to heavy use, if you are light normal user than 1.5 day (9-10 hrs SOT) makes it easily better than the any other phones in this price segment , 66W fast charging is also enough for me , I know many people will be looking for more fast charging , but they don't know that fast charging actually harming your phone's battery health. so 66W charging is enough for your phone, It takes 45-50 min to full charge, which is acceptable .  5. Service Center - Many of you already know Iqoo is sub brand of Vivo and it uses all 650+ Vivo service centers all across the country, so after sale services of all Iqoo phones is also very good , I already checked some youtuber all brand service centers reviews , and Vivo Iqoo is always good in that  Now coming to cons, it is neatpicking as cons are very subjective for anyone, it is not a very big issue for everyone ,  1. Ultrawide camera :- If you use Ultrawide camera very much, very frequently then you should avoid this phn , but in this price range most of the phone offers 8MP Ultrawide camera (except Edge 40 Neo 13MP which is also average ,) with inconsistent pictures ,very inaccurate colors , picture will be not sharp , average picture quality, ultrawide camera doesn't offer 4K video recording etc etc..  2. Sound :- It has Mono Speaker which is obviously loud and crystal clear , for those who use phone without headphone or earbuds, Dual speaker is very important nowadays , for me who didn't use dual speaker phone earlier , it is not a big deal , actually I liked this phone speaker as compared to my previous phn, Most of the time i use headphone with my phone , and i don't prefer to disturb others with loud sound of my phone , Edge 40 Neo has best Speaker quality , and Both Oneplus and Realme has dual speaker which has decent output.  3. OS :- Funtouch OS 13 is very improved and stable now as compared last 3-4yrs back , but has many bloatwares (which can be uninstalled), Hot apps and Hot games (which can be diasbled) , one need to turn off the notification of all vivo browser Iqoo services otherwise it can be annoying , but as per twiter and youtube Funtouch OS 14 will come in this phone in next month, which will be bloatware free and will be buttery smooth animation and fast UI experience . Accodring to me my UI Preference will be OxygenOS > MyUX (Moto) > FuntouchOS (for its customization and smooth UI) > RealmeUI (comes with most ad & Bloatwares)  Verdict : - As of now no other phone launches in this price category which is very ahead of this phone , Oneplus Nord CE 3 will be 2nd best choice for me , overall a decent phn in this category but i was looking for Curved AMOLED and best Camera quality which this phn lacks, Edge 40 Neo has very mixed reviews with heating issue and battery issue and so saturated camera output which is not my taste, Realme is a okay okay phone , Good Display but average camera and average performance with ticking all the boxes but a average phn which is not coming top in any department.",NEGATIVE
This phone is very good. I have been rating the mobile for six months. It is a very heavy mobile. Battery is good. Phone charging is full in one hour. 1to 100. Performance is good. Feel like premium. Sound is good. Phone looking is very nice . Thank you iQQ,POSITIVE
"Best phone for elders, Screen size is big of clear view and excellent built quality. Even though battery size is big phone is not feeling thick and heavy. Lag free UI experience with 3.5mm jack.",POSITIVE
"Over all Performence are Best. Like Battery, Display, Evening is Best Performing. Best Budget Smart Phone.",POSITIVE
"Worst smartphone I have used in my life. Fingerprint scanner stopped working after few days. UPI apps like phone pay and Paytm don't work anymore. Can't search any contact by name suddenly, no inputs can be made to search bar. Lots of bugs in software. Avoid this phone.",NEGATIVE
"Easily competes with 12-15k phones from Realme; comes with some bloatware which can easily be removed. Highly recommended for new android users as well as those seeking a quality phone for a low price. You can easily extend storage (flash) to 1TB by buying an SDXC card, and preferably buying the 128GB variant. Haven't faced much heating issues, but would edit this review after 1,3,6 months of usage.",NEGATIVE
"Overall this phone is good but there is one drawback that is its front camera which is not good, selfie is not clear.",NEGATIVE
"Look wise good , big display good battery backup",POSITIVE
"It seems phone is launched in very hurry without seeing how other apps like banking particularly open in phone. All banking apps do not open with proper UI and user can not use as button, text are not aligned / visible.  It is complete nightmare to setup phone as I lost important data while migrating old Redmi phone to this new phone and once I see apps are not working then back to old phone.  I demand to take back the phone and return money . I do not want to use this any more. There no rating option to give in minus otherwise my rating would be minus since phone is premature launch and it is considered as cheating to customer.",NEGATIVE
"Excellent mobile phone at affordable price. Configuration is very high. Battery is fabulous, charges phone in just 27 minutes from 2% to 100%. Rest all is good. Must buy product if you want to buy new one right now.",POSITIVE
"After using this phone for a month, I can say it's a great choice, especially for the price. The first thing I noticed was the weight—it feels surprisingly light despite housing a large 5500 mAh battery, which is impressive for long-lasting power without adding bulk. The phone is slim, comfortable to hold, and fits well in the hand, making it ideal for daily use.  The camera quality is good for standard photos but has limitations. While it handles basic shots decently, the wide-angle video quality falls short, and there’s no 60 fps option in 4K, which could be a drawback for those who love detailed video work. Additionally, I noticed the camera app tends to lag or even get stuck after taking multiple portrait-mode shots, which disrupts the experience a bit.  Overall, it's a solid budget option with good design, reasonable performance, and decent battery life, though the camera could use a few software improvements for smoother functionality.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus Nord CE 4 is arguably the best phone in the under-25k price range. It features a massive 5500mAh battery, and the 100W fast charging is a significant plus. The battery easily lasts 7-8 hours with regular use, including apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and YouTube. The speakers are loud and crisp, delivering an excellent audio experience. OxygenOS 15 is buttery smooth, adding to the overall premium feel of the device.  Overall, I absolutely love this phone!",POSITIVE
"Really like the build quality, Camera, Sound and performance. Somehow I am expecting much from picture quality but it is okay. As the performance is wonderful.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus Nord CE 4 in Celadon Marble is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a balance of style and performance at a reasonable price. The Celadon Marble color gives the phone a premium, unique look that stands out, and it feels great in hand with its sleek, lightweight design.  With 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the phone handles multitasking smoothly, even with multiple apps running. The performance is snappy and responsive, thanks to its optimized processor and OxygenOS, which offers a clean, intuitive user experience. The battery life is impressive, lasting through a full day of moderate use, and fast charging is a real convenience.  The camera quality is solid for this price range, delivering",POSITIVE
"I've been using this phone for about a week now and I feel that it's super awesome. Let's talk about the pros and cons : Pros 1. The display is pretty bright and amazing. It can play HDR videos upto 1440p in YouTube and you can set your device to brighten up while playing HDR videos in the setting. 2. The UI is very smooth. It has a lot of features too! 3. The cameras are awesome! They click such amazing photos and shoot amazing videos. It clicks natural photos. There are modes like timelapse,slow-mo,etc too. It has OIS, which only records at 1080p 60fps. There is a mode in the video section named 'ultra steady' by which you can use OIS. 4. The performance of the phone is amazing and is well optimised! 5. The built is quality is nice too! 6. The charging is fabulous! It has a 100 watt charger in the box which can full charge your phone in 25 minutes when smart rapid charging is on. The battery backup is just amazing. This phone gives a whopping 1.5-2 days of battery backup. 7. There is a feature that you might not know, you can adjust the intensity of brightness of the torch by pressing and holding the torch symbol, just like iphones. 8. The speakers are loud AF! After updating there is this mode where you could ultra boost volume upto 300% which is crazy! And it's very-very loud.  Cons 1. It can't play 2160p in HDR. 2. It doesn't support OIS on 4k 30fps and the OIS video has very slight unnoticeable jitterness. 3. The animation is kinda slow but smooth for me, so I changed it in developer options. 4. The frame and back is made up of plastic.  The phone is pretty awesome and the cons don't bother me 😄. I'm a tech enthusiast so you can trust on me!",POSITIVE

Using this phone from last 7 days. Look wise this phone is great and handy also. Back camera takes some boosted pics(Specially Green color) which some people may like. Selfie camera applies some beatification on images. Sound is clear and loud but bass is missing. UI is smooth but it filled with more bloat wares but thank god no Hot apps and Hot games. Network and Connectivity is well and good as of now. Battery is good but not great as compared to 5500 MAH battery. Charging speed is more than enough for me. You can expect the battery will last 1 day if you are a average user. It should have a memory card slot as it is a budget phone. The phone doesn't have any heating issue.,POSITIVE
"Though I am not a specialist of the smart phone and not a heavy user or gamer either, but I like the performance of this phone in this price tag. You can see some stuffs in youtube like someone keeping the phone under water for 10 min though phone is working fine !! belive me these are all publicity stunt. But yes this phone comes with a bright ips panel with 120 hz refresh rate and with decent Dolby Atmos sound. I am using the 8gb and 128 gb varient which is preety nice. The premium vegan leather finish is very good and comfortable. All my phone specialists friends also likes this phone. Best phone under 14k I must say.",POSITIVE

"Pros Display is 2K clear,punchy and brighter. Battery SOT is Awesome. Speakers are very loud. Haptics are good. Charging spped is good but i recommend using 10/18W charger to charge it at night so u will maintain good battery health for very longtime. Cpu is extremely optimized it doesn't throttle but whereas GPU throttles in Gpu benchmarks which doesnt occur at gaming so u dont need to worry about that. Camera is OK Ok not perfect but no bad too. No panel gaps.  Cons: Software i say its not much of premium and i recommend many of them to not to update it and keep it stock software.",POSITIVE

Few things what I experienced 1 In this price it is way better and beautiful phone. 2 BGMI works in 120Hz by default and can go upto 144 hz and it feels so defferent and u have better upper hand in this game. 3 camera is also very good.works in all day night. 4 battery is 6000Mah and charger is 120 watt it takes 30 minutes to charge from 0-100 and and last for a day or more depending upon ur usage. 5 Screen is very bright in pure day light too under extreme sunlight and can use extra dimming for pure dark . 6 Sound is very punchy and loud , 7 Dynamic light on the camera rings feels premium. 8 Snapdragon 8 elite is way faster than others no heating issue .  There is 1 major drawback which I felt Although the ultra Sonic finger print works way faster than optical finger print and it works well with even wet hand BUT.......it does not work when u apply any screen guard it never recognise ur finger no matters which screen guard u apply it only works with thin paper screen guard only at present there is no settings to overcome this flaw.  Rest phone is very fast beautiful,handy and looks premium with all the latest features.",POSITIVE
Pros Phone Display - Awesome with extremely high resolution screen  Camera - Main Camera is pretty good with crystal clear pics and multiple options for Zoom  Battery - Last Solid 1-1.5 days with Net and light Gaming usage. Charger is extremely fast and phone gets fully charged in 30 mins  Processor - Pretty fast with Gaming Engine adjusting itself depending on type of game being played...Memory availability is high  Speakers - Pretty Good & Clear Sound Volumes in speaker mode  Cons  Selfie Camera - Selfie Camera could have been better... pics are not clear if the external surroundings lighting is not optimal.  However if the external lights are good then Selfie Pics are clear in terms of resolution and clarity  Touch - Lags sometimes while moving from one window to other...could have been better... However it is not let down otherwise  Overall a Solid Performance Phone with Livid High Resolution Camera,POSITIVE
"Great performance, 30min charging time for full battery, great twerking options for all games from frame rate increase too 144fps, increase games orignal quality to high. Gaming beast. Average camera. Great display and less heat up. Must buy for gamers, You don't need Rog phone (display ppi and resolution is higher on iQOO 13) . Believe me.",POSITIVE
"My ratings 4.45/5⭐  Okay! I'm writing this review after one month of usage. I played BGMI and FF, ran antutu test and cpu throttling too..  Pros:-  1) Gaming:- No doubt that this is the best phone for gaming at this price segment, I played both FF and BGMI on this device, the dimensity 7300 processor runs so smoothly so that you can experience a lag free gaming even in high graphics/resolution. (To experience true 90FPS gaming you need to turn on the GT mode).  2)Performance:- Gaming phones generally do perform well on normal usage too, same here, the processor was good enough and runs smoothly even on multitasking. (Can give a max of 120hz refresh rate). Performance wise no doubt, you will be satisfied!  3)Design and display: The 6.67 inch OLED display was really good and appreciable!  4)Camera:- Although primarily this was not a camera phone but still the picture quality was fine and good, with a 50mp back camera and 16mp front camera (Back camera was better though).  5)Battery:- Battery backup was good, comes with a 45W supervoc UF inbox charger, Takes almost 1 hr 20 mins to charge fully from zero. Can give a full working day backup on normal usage.  6) Sound quality:- Sound quality was fine, The stereo speakers are loud and clear, For calls they've included clear voice(ENC) feature too. (There was no Dolby Atmos BTW, should 've included it! :)  7) Comfort in hand: Trust me, this mobile is really comfortable in hand while holding and gaming. You don't feel any slipperiness.  Cons:-  1) The main problem i personally experienced is 'overheating', like wtf man it goes till 42.5°C while charging and 41°C while gaming at a room temperature of 30 degrees!!  2) Too much bloatware from the app market (although you can clear it).  3) build quality/looks:- The built quality can be improved, both frame and back comes with a plastic material and No Gorrila glass too:)  4) Should also have included NFC tap to pay or Gorrila glass as most phone's at this price are providing any one of them.  5) Antutu scores: When I ran antutu test, it scored nearly 670k (BTW they've said 750k)👎🏻. Although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).  Final verdict: This phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. If you prefer good camera and build quality/design this might not be a better choice for you!!  This phone worked well for me!! I advice you to check other reviews too:)",POSITIVE
Ultimate phone in this price range (Rs 14498). Screen and performance is very good. And green colour is also attractive colour. Only cons is camera is ok ok but not bed. Battery backup is good and fast charging takes approx 1hr for full charge. And realme UI is awesome and friendly. I am using this phone since a week.,POSITIVE
"The REALME Narzo 70 Turbo is hands down the best budget gaming phone under ₹20K! It's an absolute beast, packing the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Energy chipset, which is usually found in phones priced well above ₹30K. Gaming and multitasking feel seamless, and it delivers top-notch performance.  The OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate is a delight to use, providing smooth visuals and vibrant colors. Storage isn't a problem either, thanks to the UFS 3.1 technology, which ensures blazing-fast read and write speeds.  Battery life is impressive, with a 5000mAh capacity, and the 45W SuperVOOC charger in the box ensures you’re back to full power in no time. While the camera is decent, the focus here is clearly on performance, which it nails perfectly.  To top it off, REALME offers 2 years of Android updates (up to Android 17) and 3 years of security updates, ensuring long-term usability.  For gamers or anyone looking for a performance-centric device at this price, the Narzo 70 Turbo is a no-brainer. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
Review after a week of usage 1) Build Quality is good 2) Battery life is good as I have good screen on time and some times gaming also 3) No heating issue. 4) charging speed is good as 45 watts is enough compare to 100 watts as you will hardly save 15 min in all. 5) Not hanged in 7days 6) software is decent plan and simple 7) looks are subjective but I like the looks.,POSITIVE
The mobile is very light weight. The camera quality is very good. We can play games in 90+fps with an awesome amoled display. Charging speed is high Sound quality in this budget is decent Touch functionality is too smooth and can see the power of 120hz refresh rate Overall the mobile is worth to buy,POSITIVE
"Good Display and handy size device. Fast charging is good 45w and 45mins-1hr can charge it fully. Average battery- Same budget 1+ Nord CE 4lite will have 30% extra charge than this. Low Call sound, in crowd area we can't hear the opponent voice. Too many unnecessary apps from Realme. It taken 2hrs to clear that and set the phone. Speakers are good for multimedia. Decent for a normal daily use. Not a Very Good device. When I order this mobile, Amazon shows 1 free earbuds (N1) from Realme. But later they twisted it and said, No such offers for me.",NEGATIVE

"It's a good mobile for this price. Camera good. Battery Ok. But charger is not good, must be atleast 45W.",NEGATIVE
"The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.  While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.  This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.  Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.  Hits: The resolution is good No heating issues with the battery Battery life is good Charge time is good  Misses: Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached) The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinches Despite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button presses A few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlock The camera is average with washed out colours  Will add more later.  Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can’t be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.",NEGATIVE
Value for money,POSITIVE
Nice mobile Camera: Average camera Battery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile. Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled range Audio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice. Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that. Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.,POSITIVE
"As I'm using this device as a secondary device.. So overall it good. 1. coming to camera the I'm also a redmi note 8 pro user which gives 64mp but still I can see photos are much better in that phone redmi 13 have 108mp but does not looks like that according to the quality and video recording resolution is low that only give a 30fps of shooting in 1080 & 720p 2. battery is good & yeah charging fast no doubtedly 3. I'm in love with the ui its quite smooth may be because its new phone but according to to my previous experience with redmi phones it very nice... 4. reso;ution is also good as compared to the price range 5. hybrid sim slot, 5g, 6gb ram as well as virtual ram is also there In summary I can say u can buy this phone if you do moderate work on phone with the good enough battery backup",POSITIVE
"Sound quality is good, processor seams great, I had received it a few hours ago, but the way I'm constantly using it shows the battery backup for it.",NEGATIVE
"When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day. First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ₹ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features. It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time. Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later. I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone. I don't agree. The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.  I thought of displacing the phone. There was no option of displacement in this. There was an option to repair and damage. Then I would apply. Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it. I rarely do that. It is lying like that. I will recommend the phone to you. Don't buy this phone. If you look at the brand.",NEGATIVE
"The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is a new entry in the competitive mid-range smartphone market. Known for delivering good value for money, Realme’s Narzo series often balances features and affordability well. With a focus on performance, display quality, and connectivity, the Narzo 70x 5G aims to attract users looking for a capable device without breaking the bank. In this review, we will delve into its key aspects, including design, display, performance, camera quality, battery life, and connectivity.  **Design and Build Quality**  The Realme Narzo 70x 5G comes in a striking Forest Green color that gives it a premium look. The design is modern and sleek, with a clean finish that is visually appealing. The device features a plastic back and frame, which is standard for its price range, but it is well-built and feels sturdy in hand. The phone is lightweight and ergonomically designed, making it comfortable for prolonged use.  The front of the phone is dominated by a 6.5-inch display with slim bezels, and the rear houses a triple camera setup housed within a rectangular module. While the design is not particularly groundbreaking, it is functional and attractive for a mid-range device.  **Display**  One of the standout features of the Narzo 70x 5G is its 120Hz Ultra Smooth Display. This high refresh rate ensures smoother animations, improved responsiveness, and an overall more fluid visual experience. For users who enjoy gaming or frequently scroll through content, this feature can significantly enhance usability.  The display itself is a 6.5-inch IPS LCD panel with Full HD+ resolution. It offers vibrant colors and decent brightness levels, making it suitable for most indoor and outdoor conditions. While it may not match the brightness and contrast ratios of high-end OLED panels, it is more than adequate for daily tasks, media consumption, and casual gaming.  **Performance**  Under the hood, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ chipset. This 6nm processor is designed to handle 5G connectivity and deliver a smooth performance for mid-range devices. Coupled with 8GB of RAM, the phone manages multitasking with ease, and app launches are swift.  In everyday use, the Narzo 70x 5G performs well, handling tasks such as web browsing, social media, and video streaming without significant hiccups. For gaming, the device is capable of running popular titles at medium to high settings, though demanding games might require reduced graphics settings for optimal performance.  The inclusion of 128GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, media, and files. For users who need more storage, the Narzo 70x also supports expandable storage via a microSD card slot, which adds flexibility for managing large files.  **Camera Performance**  The Realme Narzo 70x 5G features a triple camera setup on the rear, consisting of a 50MP primary sensor, a 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. The main 50MP camera performs well in various lighting conditions, capturing sharp and detailed images. The AI enhancements help in optimizing colors and improving photo quality, making the camera versatile for different shooting scenarios.  The macro lens is useful for close-up shots, though it can sometimes struggle with focus and detail in low light. The depth sensor aids in creating bokeh effects for portrait shots, and while it works effectively, the results may not be as refined as those from higher-end devices.  On the front, the Narzo 70x 5G sports a 16MP selfie camera that delivers good quality selfies. The camera app includes various modes and filters to enhance the user experience, and it performs admirably for social media and video calls.  **Battery Life**  The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is equipped with a 5000mAh battery, which is a generous capacity for a mid-range phone. Combined with the efficient Dimensity 6100+ processor and the 120Hz display, the battery life is commendable. Users can expect a full day of moderate to heavy use, including web browsing, media consumption, and occasional gaming.  The phone also comes with a 45W fast charger in the box, which is a significant advantage. The fast charging feature allows the device to quickly regain power, minimizing downtime and ensuring that users can get back to using their phone without extended waits.  **Connectivity and Software**  As the name suggests, the Narzo 70x 5G supports 5G connectivity, providing future-proofing for users looking to take advantage of the latest network technology. The device also includes other connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.1, and GPS.  On the software front, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G runs on Realme UI, based on Android. The interface is user-friendly and includes various customization options, enhancing the overall user experience. However, the phone does come with some pre-installed bloatware, which may not be necessary for all users.  **Positive Aspects**  1. **High Refresh Rate Display**: The 120Hz Ultra Smooth Display enhances the overall visual experience, providing fluid animations and smoother interactions. 2. **Solid Performance**: The Dimensity 6100+ chipset, combined with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth performance for everyday tasks and moderate gaming. 3. **Good Battery Life**: The 5000mAh battery, along with 45W fast charging, offers long-lasting usage and quick recharging. 4. **Expandable Storage**: The option to expand storage via microSD adds flexibility for managing files and media. 5. **Attractive Design**: The Forest Green color and sleek design give the phone a premium feel, despite its plastic construction.  **Negative Aspects**  1. **Average Display Quality**: While the 120Hz refresh rate is a highlight, the display’s overall quality is typical for an IPS LCD and may not match the vibrant contrast of OLED screens. 2. **Camera Performance**: While the 50MP main camera is competent, the additional sensors (macro and depth) may not provide significant improvements and can struggle in low light conditions. 3. **Bloatware**: The pre-installed apps on Realme UI might not be useful for all users and can clutter the interface. 4. **Plastic Build**: The use of plastic for the back and frame, while common in this price range, might not feel as premium as glass or metal alternatives.  **Conclusion**  The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is a well-rounded smartphone that offers a range of features catering to the mid-range market segment. Its 120Hz display, solid performance, and good battery life make it a competitive option. However, some limitations in display quality, camera performance, and bloatware should be considered. For users seeking a balance of performance and value, the Narzo 70x 5G is a strong contender, though it may not meet the needs of those looking for a high-end experience.",POSITIVE
"This phone is worth of the price it offers, has a good camera, sturdy build, nice looks, also tye RAM and ROM combination is also good, Chipset is of low caliber as compare to others but works smoothly. Battery is a plus point 6000mah comes with 45W fast charger Oh and for music lovers you can connect wired earphones also which is getting rare now in new phones Weight wise it's lightweight in hand Feel premium in hand Camera is very good It's 5g in this price range with nice memory, Battery backup, performance and so Overall it's a good buy if you are looking for a mid range 5g smartphones with good camera and battery.",POSITIVE
"I liked it much and the phone is worth It. I bought it 3 months ago and cost me 12K. The phone size is big enough and phone quality is okay. The phone doesn't got heated up till now and Battery is superb. The phone charging us super fast, get's charged full in less than an Hour and lasts up to 1 day in full charge. I liked it in this price. But the brightness accomodation is not good. The performance is good and smooth and also no phone hanging issue faced till now. Overall a nice phone to buy.",POSITIVE
"The realme narzo 70 x 5g is a great mid ranged smartphone with a good camera, well equipped with a 5000 mah battery. The box comes equipped with a charger, a phone case and a phone? I guess. Though the phone is not best suited for gaming. The processor is not that great. And the display is not something I prefer either. The phone is best suited for non gaming activities. Have to gift a phone to your parents? Need a phone for work? The realme narzo 70 x 5g is a great phone at a good price.",POSITIVE
"The Realme Narzo 70x 5G has a lot going for it—on paper, it looks like a fantastic deal. The 6GB RAM and 128GB storage combo handles everyday tasks and multitasking like a champ. Powered by the Dimensity 6100+ 6nm processor, the phone feels fast and responsive, even with demanding apps. Plus, 5G support ensures you're set for the future.  The 120Hz refresh rate promises smooth visuals, but here's the catch: the display itself is disappointing. Colors look dull, brightness isn't great, and the viewing angles leave a lot to be desired. Watching videos or gaming on this phone just doesn’t feel as immersive as it should, which is a shame considering its other strong features.  That said, the 50MP AI camera is a highlight, taking clear and detailed photos in good lighting. Another big plus is the 45W charger included in the box, which charges the phone super quickly—a lifesaver when you're on the go.  What I Liked: Strong performance thanks to Dimensity 6100+ Reliable 50MP camera for casual photography 5G-ready, keeping you future-proof Fast charging with the 45W charger  What I Didn't Like: The display is a letdown (dull colors, low brightness, poor viewing angles)  Overall, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G does a lot of things right, but the subpar display holds it back from being a great all-rounder. If you don’t mind compromising on display quality, this phone offers good value for money.",NEGATIVE
Mobile looks very elegant. Speed is good. Battery lasts long and fast charging as mentioned in product description. Delivered on time.. Camera quality is good. Great product,POSITIVE
"Phone is good , sleek but the main concern is charger , Esim scanner not available thought it was mentioned in the phone that Esim will be there in the box.",NEGATIVE
"For the Google Pixel product, there will be the brand symbol. But this product is a generic brand. I don't recommend it.",NEGATIVE
Great and good all type basis. Value for money. Camera also good. 5g connectivity is great. Great and good all type basis. Value for money. Camera also good. 5g connectivity is great.,POSITIVE
Best smartphone under this budget Phone quality 5/5 Sound quality 5/5 Display quality 5/5 Very nice according to price. Must buy . Value for money. Thanks,POSITIVE
Surprisingly good product for the price. I have generally purchased the flagship phones of OnePlus with the assumption that they are better than the Nord-series. I now stand corrected. The NORD CE range is definitely an economical range and not meant for heavy usage but the Nord series are more than capable of taking on heavy usage. The camera is not great but at the price point it is more than adequate. The phone is well built and looks good. The finger print reader is quick and efficient. Phone functionality being almost bare bones androrid is high on user friendliness. A definite buy!,POSITIVE
"Bought the phone a month ago. Safe to say at this price range, for me, it's banger. A fast and smooth software experience and tough and durable hardware.  The oxygen os 15 update made the software smoother and brought some cool features as well. Battery gives an excellent backup, charges quick, the display is great and flat. Also the metal design is unique.  The only downside, or might i say, a slight disappointment is the camera. Not that good at this price. Still and over-all great one. Not even noticeable to the average user. Apart from that, One plus nailed it.",POSITIVE
"This is my first OnePlus device, before this iam user of poco believe me oxygen OS is far better than miui/ Hyper os. It's lag free,and very smoothly work, battery is al great, camera is not upto mark but ok. Performance is next level iam loving with it😎",POSITIVE
"I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4. It is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. I bought this phone during Great Indian festival after so much research and doubts. I was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. I was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. I don't want to compromise in any one thing. So after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. But in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. Curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. Now i feel it was the best decision. Best features of this Nord 4 are- Design - I literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. I thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. It cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all. Performance - It has the best performance and able to play BGMI so smoothly. Flat screen helps so much in games also. Battery - If you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins. Camera - I felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. If camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, Samsung or Iphone which are camera centric. But then other areas you have to compromise. Trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos. Network - Being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. Never felt any Issues at all. Display - It has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.  This review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for Oneplus Nord 4 for sure. Greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....  (If any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)",POSITIVE
"I've never had a OnePlus device before so I'll be totally unbiased over my experience for this phone since I bought it by the time of of first day launch🤗  1) Design: (9.5/10 Subjective) I love it but t's subjective is you prefer a glass built over a metal or the dual tone colours/texture appeals you less or more, but ultimately it's one of the most eye catching designs launched this year apart from the Nothing phones that has managed to attain a premium appearance in a very simple unibody structure.  2) Performance: (8.5/10) This is what makes it one of the top competitors within the 30k lineup phones. I personally play a lot of gatcha games like Genshin, Honkai and Wuthering Waves, over fps shooting so I would definitely say that gatcha games being heavier in graphics, Nord 4 is capable to provide the most efficient gaming. Practically speaking if you avoid those YouTube reviews with AnTuTu, any android phone would at some point face fps drop if you play in the highest settings and I do believe with what I've heard that even with high end processors like Snapdragon 7+ 3, OnePlus always limits it's potential which is why we do get to see some throttling, but on a long term it doesn't matter. If you are a daily user with 2-3 hours of heavy gaming per day or more with breaks after every 45 minutes to 1 hour of heavy graphic gameplay, then you could definitely have a great experience. If you are just a normal user, you can choose it blindly.  3) Built and UI: (9/10 for strength and quality but 7/10 for being expensive to replace) Ofcourse being metal you would expect a little bit of weight (around 200 grams) but you get used to it and it really feels much premium to feel that metallic weight in your hand. It might get really slippery and if it falls down it might not have scratches except for the glass portion around the camera but might face dents on the metal if the fall is too harsh, so I would suggest to have a back cover, and let's be honest no matter how premium the phone is even if it looks great, they are all at the end of the day sensitive and how you manage to care for it depends totally on you. Be responsible. And as I mentioned, it's going to be really expensive to replace a unibody metal frame if it's cracked or dented even if it's strong enough to work so be careful. As for the UI I've been a Xiaomi user so honestly I don't feel much different in terms of operating system with bloatware, but I really don't feel bothered by it as long as I'm able to disable it. I uninstalled and disabled not almost but EVERY single bloatware in this phone that I possibly could have including app market and even the gaming tool so now I don't get those security checks after installing apps and it feels as clean as any Flagship phone.  3) Battery: (8/10) It's good. Definitely better battery life than my iPhone BUT for how big the battery is, the Oxygen OS hasn't optimised it's battery life to it's maximum just as I mentioned before for its Processor but it's not a big deal. 5500mAH is something we see less as the price goes higher over handheld devices because they try to add more space for gimmicks like wireless charging which in my opinion is not very practical everytime unless you carry a wireless charger everywhere and they are really slow. But the wired charging in OnePlus with the 100 watt out of the box charger is great and it charges the device to full within 30 minutes tho I would suggest to toggle the option from Battery Health settings to charge it till 80 percentage so you can keep it's battery health stable for long. I hope they optimise it in the future updates but honestly it gives you around 7-8 hours of life with regular usage and even more if you are a light user which is more than enough considering that at some point you will need to charge your device any way.  4) Display: (8/10) It's a very smooth 120hz amoled panel with HDR support in Netflix that I never really use because I watch on my MacBook or the television (it's just better to watch anything on a bigger display over a phone to keep your visions safe) and an unnamed protection (Panda glass according to few sources) but I'll be practical over how much it actually matters. Being someone who has changed the displays in the past after getting it broken, it doesn't matter what Gorilla glass they put on your phone, it's a glass at the end of the day and if you are not being responsible enough by handling your phone with care, it's expected for your screen to face damage. Use a good tempered glass around 3-4 USD (200-400 INR) I won't suggest to go higher because no matter how expensive it is, even if it's able to handle a bend test, practically any tempered display is penetrable if it falls flat on a rough surface UNLESS you have a good thick back cover. Overall it's a good display but I feel that the brightness could be a bit bother outside if you live in a heavily bright environment. Personally I didn't face any issues for the time being as the peak brightness is really good in the sunlight but if you compare it to some cheaper devices, it might feel a little less.  5) Heating Stabilization: (9/10) I mean, it's metal? Ofcourse it's going to be hot DURING a gameplay but HEATING DOESN'T MEAN PERFORMANCE DROP. Also it's during the time when you are playing or doing some heavy task but the best part of metal is that it cools down as fast as it heats up and the cooling chamber in this phone is really efficient. Overall It's definitely better in terms of heat stabilization than any glass/plastic built phones for being a metal although I would say that, if you are travelling in a constantly hot temperature, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight for too long as it might get hot or else again, Use a back cover. BUT I'd also suggest to not use a back cover when doing some heavy gaming because it makes you loose the purpose of having a metal phone with such a good heating stabilization as plastic makes it harder to escape the heat.  6) Camera: (7/10 Subjective) This isn't my place but I would still give some opinion. It is decent and when I say that, it is actually not bad at all infact really good along it's limitations. It has a very natural tone on the back camera with a really good potrait mode and a decent front camera definitely better than a 25k phone but ofcourse with the specifications you see, there are limitations if you compare it to other phones in the same price. It's definitely better than Nothing 2a in terms of color and stability but not as close to camera centred phones like Vivo/Realme in the midrange but then again those phones lack either performance or the brand value, as OnePlus is much premium as a brand than Vivo/Realme even if they are from the same company. Again it is subjective and this phone in my opinion is rather a balance of performance along with the things you need in a midrange close-to-flagship phone rather than being an entire camera phone, but it's still really good even with the limitations of telephoto and other things that I find gimmick because I'm not a camera phone user.  Overall: (8.25) It's a great phone for both everyday users and decent to heavy gamers. I might score it higher in the future if they successfully optimise the Operating system in the future updates and push it to 9 even with a decent camera because this phone has a lot of potential and considering it's future update promises of 4+6 for Android and security patch, it's a very good purchase. Just praying that these phones don't face any green line issues in the future.",POSITIVE
"With CC discount, got it for a great bargain price. could not ask for more. Elegant, premium look. Wonderful camera, UI is also good. using it since 10 days, yet to explore many features.

"Just 3 days review with phone: Pros: 1 Light weight with large battery, easily one day backup for heavy use(should put refresh rate at auto, )even with 5 g 2.Good display for media consumption 3.Good main camera- decent night, and potraits pics for the price,super moon mode is cherry on top 4.Fast charging 5.No heating issue while charging or gaming  Cons: 1.Fun touch os, filled with bloatwares, need to uninstall those and turn off all toggles of v app store, 2.Shuld take care of phone like a baby,as display and edge protection is mandatory..if not a display change could cause half of phones price, 3.If u hv obsession for curved display like me then this phone is the value for money for 25k, if not don't go for this (Based on regular software updates ,better performance, less heating issue and service centre availability I considered this over moto edge 50 fusion, but it has gorilla glass protection ,stock android os and vegan leather finishes with more color options)",NEGATIVE
"It's been a month using this phone (12/256 variant) No lag while gaming(Iqoo is known for it), also there are many features related to gaming..bgmi runs in hdr 60fps..Camera is excellent for potraits..display is also good with various features.. battery is enough for whole day.. overall a all-rounder ❤️ Although the delivery took 20 days that's the only negetive point",POSITIVE
"iQOO Z9s Pro - 8/256GB - 25 January 2025. iQOO did not disappoint. This is an amazing gadget to own. Very good camera, both front 16mp and rear 50mp, producing detailed well-balanced photos with very natural colour tones. Snapdragon 7 Gen 3- super powerful for all functionality. Fast and very accurate finger print reading. It has proper curved display. It will be difficult to maintain this. And you'll never find a satisfactory screen guard ever. But that was expected. But the display is aesthetically pleasing. In-hand feel also is just amazing with no sharp edges.  5000+ battery - it last to the second day easily. And 80W power adaptor charges it in around 30 minutes to full.!!!  Under 25000 Rs. its a great value for money device. And iQOO brand, I felt, is very reliable. This is my second iQOO phone.  Overall its a great value for money.",POSITIVE
"Phone looks fine, performance is good, the phone look is premium with curve screen, The camera quality is awesome in this range. Overall its Value for money package.",POSITIVE
Battery life is good. Good gaming performance. display is also smooth and fast. No hanging and sound is very nice and clear sound. In 25k out of imagination. Very nice Vivo and IQOO.❤️,POSITIVE
Yeah! iQOO z9spro 5g is the phone who is looking for a good sleek design and moderate gamers and good battery life with an above average camera . I think the phone design is much better I feels iQOO z7 pro is a good design and overall phone It is an upgrade version of the last gen and in-hand hand feel is awesome and if you want good phone around 25k it's the allrounder than grab it ⭐⭐⭐1/2 it's my rating to these funtouch os may improve further. So thank you Vivo for bringing these phones at these price range.,POSITIVE
"This phone is one of the best options in its segment, offering an exceptional display with vibrant colors and sharp clarity. The camera performance is outstanding, capturing detailed and crisp photos in various lighting conditions. In terms of performance, it handles multitasking and gaming effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for everyday use. While the overall experience is fantastic, I found the speakers to be slightly underwhelming. However, this is a minor drawback in an otherwise excellent device that delivers on almost every front.""",POSITIVE
"I gave it 4 stars. The selfie camera could have been better. The battery is good, the back camera is also good. I am giving a review after using it for 9 days. This mobile is okay for this price.",POSITIVE
"It's a good mobile for this price. Camera good. Battery Ok. But charger is not good, must be atleast 45W.",NEGATIVE
"The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.  While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.  This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.  Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.  Hits: The resolution is good No heating issues with the battery Battery life is good Charge time is good  Misses: Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached) The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinches Despite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button presses A few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlock The camera is average with washed out colours  Will add more later.  Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can’t be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.",NEGATIVE
Value for money,POSITIVE
Nice mobile Camera: Average camera Battery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile. Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled range Audio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice. Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that. Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.,POSITIVE
"As I'm using this device as a secondary device.. So overall it good. 1. coming to camera the I'm also a redmi note 8 pro user which gives 64mp but still I can see photos are much better in that phone redmi 13 have 108mp but does not looks like that according to the quality and video recording resolution is low that only give a 30fps of shooting in 1080 & 720p 2. battery is good & yeah charging fast no doubtedly 3. I'm in love with the ui its quite smooth may be because its new phone but according to to my previous experience with redmi phones it very nice... 4. reso;ution is also good as compared to the price range 5. hybrid sim slot, 5g, 6gb ram as well as virtual ram is also there In summary I can say u can buy this phone if you do moderate work on phone with the good enough battery backup",POSITIVE
"Sound quality is good, processor seams great, I had received it a few hours ago, but the way I'm constantly using it shows the battery backup for it.",NEGATIVE
"When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day. First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ₹ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features. It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time. Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later. I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone. I don't agree. The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.  I thought of displacing the phone. There was no option of displacement in this. There was an option to repair and damage. Then I would apply. Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it. I rarely do that. It is lying like that. I will recommend the phone to you. Don't buy this phone. If you look at the brand.",NEGATIVE
"I had switched to the S23 Ultra from the iPhone 13. For me, the S23 Ultra is in a different league compared to the iPhone 13. The cameras are so much better and the telephoto lens of the phone also adds an interesting and useful component to the phone. even when gaming, it gives me 120 fps in most of the games. the display is fantastic and even the charging is adequately fast and reliable. (you need to buy the 45w charger separately.) apart from that, the speakers are fantastic and the haptic feedback is great too. The only major downside I found is that it heats a little bit while you play heavy games and the phone charges slowly while being used. overall, if you can get this phone below 85k now, definitely go for it as it almost has no difference compared to the S24 ultra. The battery backup is also great and 1.5 charging cycles lasts me the entire day. (my average SOT is 10-14 hours). The S pen is also quite handy and is useful occasionally. I would say this is the best all-rounder Android phone you can get if you're looking for a phone below the 100k barrier. Also, the phone will get updates till Android 17 so there is no worry of the OS falling back in time and will run you a good 3 years even if you buy the phone now. Remember that the phone is huge and only buy it if you're comfortable with this form factor or this phone may render as useless to you. go for the regular s23 models if you're not a hardcore user but if you have the budget and requiremnts of the features in this phone i would 100% recommend this phone to you.",POSITIVE
"I always wanted to experience a curved display flagship smartphone by Samsung, hence ignored the S24 Ultra and bought the S23 Ultra because it's the last curved display phone by Samsung.  First of all, I got the phone delivered within 5 hours of placing the order, so thanks to Amazon for superfast delivery  Now coming to the phone  Pros: 1) Performance is just excellent. No heating issues faced. SD 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy is greatly optimized by Samsung. 2) One UI is the best custom Android UI on the market 3) Cameras : no explanation needed. The portraits, the night shots, video recording capabilities are just excellent 4) Battery : lasts easily for 1.5 days with moderate usage with QHD resolution, will lasts even more with FHD+ resolution. 5) Display : excellent quality display, perfectly visible in bright sunlight. It's a joy to watch movies on this screen  Cons: 1) At least 25W charger should have been provided in the box 2) Though the charging speed might be a con for some people, I think it's good that Samsung doesn't provide ultra high speed charging on its phones, ensuring longer battery life.  Overall, just go for it. Even if you buy today you can use it till at least Dec 2028 without any updates issue.",POSITIVE

The S Pen integration is a great addition for productivity. While it's on the expensive side, the premium build, exceptional display, and top-notch camera make it one of the best flagship smartphones available.",POSITIVE
Phone look wise amazing Great camera quality both front and rear value for money Great Touch quality and smoothness AI feature is functionality fantastic  But as far as battery life is concerned draining very fast .....needs to charge twice or thrice a day without any heavy usage of phone  Rear Camera quality at 200 MP is worst Vivo v 40 is better compare to this,NEGATIVE

"The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G offers an attractive package, especially for users seeking solid performance at a budget-friendly price. Here’s a closer look at its key aspects:  Design and Display:  The Aqua Flow variant looks sleek with its gradient finish, adding a touch of elegance. The phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, making it easy for one-handed use. Its 6.58-inch Full HD+ display is sharp and vibrant, offering good color reproduction and brightness for media consumption. Though not AMOLED, the display performs well in outdoor lighting conditions and provides smooth scrolling with a 120Hz refresh rate.  Performance:  Powered by the Dimensity 6300 5G chipset, this device ensures a snappy and fluid user experience. It handles multitasking well, although the 4GB RAM might struggle slightly with heavier apps and games when compared to 6GB or 8GB variants. For regular usage like social media, video streaming, and casual gaming, the phone performs admirably. The inclusion of 5G support is a strong future-proofing move, especially at this price point.  Camera:  The 50MP Sony AI Camera setup is one of the phone’s strongest features. It takes good-quality pictures in daylight with sharp details and vivid colors. However, low-light performance could be better, as images tend to get noisy in dim environments. The AI optimizations, such as scene recognition, enhance the photography experience, making it easy to capture decent shots with minimal effort. The front camera is decent for selfies and video calls, though not exceptional.  Battery and Charging:  The phone packs a 5000mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day of moderate use. The charger in the box is a nice touch, offering fast charging support that gets the phone charged in under two hours. Battery optimization is good, ensuring you won’t run out of juice during regular day-to-day tasks.  Storage and Software:  With 128GB of storage, there’s ample room for apps, media, and files, and the phone supports microSD expansion if needed. The software experience is clean and customizable with iQOO’s Funtouch OS, which runs smoothly on Android. The UI is user-friendly, though there are some pre-installed apps that may not be necessary, but they can be uninstalled.  Verdict:  The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G is a competitive mid-range smartphone with solid performance, 5G support, a reliable camera, and good battery life. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly 5G phone with a stylish design, it’s a solid pick, but the 4",POSITIVE
"I am reviewing this after fully used and drop, ip test with pros and cons. If you want a phone with great performance, decent Camara also with latest Android 14 under 12k this phone will be perfect.. Best things are it's comes with Android 14 with funtouch os (if you are previously Vivo user you will got this) which is a great experience for me as 1st time user. On these segment its comes with 50 mp Sony IMX sensor 😘 with popular modes like slomo, which is really appreciated for budget lovers.. It's also supported 2k resolution with no lag..🤩 You will get 6gb ram with auto booster and 128 gb variant under 12k, it's a massive storage on budget..🤗 Ip64 with dust resistant, I have compared with other phones on this budget they have ip54 with no dust resistant feature..😄 This are the main points that I liked much, also I liked the wifi 5, fingerprint it's really fast with no animation, less bloat apps, ultra game mode etc..😉 Let's see the cons that I've got..😑🥴 Charging watt should be better at least 20 watts with inbox charger, 10 watt charger comes with it but the phone is supported 25 watt fast charging.. but 5000mah is good for long lasting uses.. charging time 5-80% was 1.15 hrs with inbox charger. Display should be comes with at least type IPS, it's comes with LCD display and decent colour gamut and 90hz gives most of all other phones on these budget. 1080p display will be much appreciated.. Design is good but if you have seen the poco c61 design that is comes with new radial cam design, so it's a disappointed because that's a under 7k phone..😆 Animation uses cause phone slower than usual..bso I will suggest not to use that..  Overall seen, decent Camera and Design, great performance (I will suggest to buy 6gb variant) with 5g variant, full day battery backup (for less gamers), IP64 with dust resistant 😍, latest Android 14 with 2 years of major upgrades and 3 years of security updates, handy weight with silicon cover on box.. Overall good on these budget segment with trust of VIVO.. 🫶",NEGATIVE

I am going to request to Amazon also please don’t keep these type of low standard product which are costing so much.

"The phone is smooth there are no major bugs in the software however the ui could be more responsive, battery life is greatttt, I had no issues with performance, it didn't include the wide angle camera which could be a major thing to some people but the main camera takes very good photos which was not expected by me , screen is great, however I felt that the auto brightness features works a little late it would take time to adjust accordingly, one more thing it does not have a physical proximity sensor but till today since using it for 2 months I haven't face any issues during calls, if you are looking for a great performance, great battery and great screen phone this is the one for you.",POSITIVE

"Amazing smartphone! It has almost all the features what a smartphone user needed. I will not mention the prose only mention the cons for future buyers.. 1. Though Battery capacity is larger but the backup is not that good. 2. display brightness is not that good, ok ok. 3. Some heating are there, but not high. So its manageable. 4.

Valuable for money.. fast charging.. without curve is better option.. something curve option can't been click..,NEGATIVE
Using this phone from last 7 days. Look wise this phone is great and handy also. Back camera takes some boosted pics(Specially Green color) which some people may like. Selfie camera applies some beatification on images. Sound is clear and loud but bass is missing. UI is smooth but it filled with more bloat wares but thank god no Hot apps and Hot games. Network and Connectivity is well and good as of now. Battery is good but not great as compared to 5500 MAH battery. Charging speed is more than enough for me. You can expect the battery will last 1 day if you are a average user. It should have a memory card slot as it is a budget phone. The phone doesn't have any heating issue.,POSITIVE
This phone not only looks good but works flawlessly. The smooth scrolling and fast 5G make it a great purchase!,POSITIVE
"For the price, this phone offers everything you need. The design is sleek, and the performance is reliable. Definitely worth buying!",POSITIVE
Very stylish and good looking performance of phone is good no hanging and battery is also good overall excellent,POSITIVE
This phone works great for social media apps. Smooth scrolling and quick loading times make it a pleasure to use.,POSITIVE
"✅Comes with default Xiomi dialer so call recording feature is a huge plus point. One may never know when it's needed.  ✅Bigger screen size: This has its own advantage and disadvantage. Good to use for elders when font size is increased on a already bigger screen size phone. Safe hand to eye distance can be easily achieved. ❌Issue is that bigger size bigger battery makes it bulky (keep in mind back cover will also add overall weight slightly). One hand use is risky because handling might become difficult for few people.  ✅Battery backup: Not sure how much Xiomi has worked on battery backup but so far it's looking decent hopefully it stays this way in future as well. (Only other Redmi phone I used was their debut model in India 'Redmi 1S' that was launched way back 10 years ago and it wasn't so good on battery backup)  ✅Updates: Received first update (security patch) today as I write this review.  ✅ Charging speed is definitely good.  ❌Storage: custom UI phones lack in this. Unnecessary apps, tweaks and customisation eat up system space. I've literally kept this phone as received it 2 weeks ago. No data saved so far and already 23 GB system space is full. 128 internal space in budget segment phones should now be default given size of apps and never ending updates.  🤷🏽Can't comment on 5G since I don't have jio connection. 4G is working fine. ❌Separate budget for screen protector and back cover.  Bought this for my mum so good for basic usage. Received this phone on 4th December 2024 so I believe 2 weeks period is still not enough to give final review.",NEGATIVE
"The Redmi A4 5G is stylish, functional, and affordable. It ticks all the right boxes for me.",POSITIVE
"1.Regular Motorola user, bought three phones for parents and relative. 2.Redmi UI is super fast with lots of customization options and minimal bloatware. 3.Camera and speaker are excellent; calling works in closed areas. 4.Display is fluid. 5.Phones work superbly, but only Jio 5G works; Airtel 5G does not work. Airtel 4G works. 6.Airtel 5G may work in the future if they launch a standalone network. 7.Same phone available on Flipkart as Poco C75 5G for 8K. 8.Prefer Redmi over Poco due to past hanging issues with Poco phones. 9.Redmi phones rarely hang, even with 2GB/16GB configuration.",POSITIVE

"The OnePlus Nord CE4 Lite 5G emerges as a compelling mid-range smartphone that offers excellent value for budget-conscious consumers.

It may not be revolutionary, but it delivers solid value for everyday use.",POSITIVE
My review : Performance [ 4/5 ] - Gaming Performance good but you'll see some frame drops and lag somewhere while using but a great gaming experience at this price. Camera [ 3/5 ] - Very limit features in camera app and quality is also not good and you'll find better options in market at 20k. Battery [ 5/5 ] - Awesome battery life and 80w fast charging is crazy and will take about 40m-60m for 0-100%. Display [ 4.5/5 ] - Good display quality in this price segment. Software [ 4/5 ] - Somewhere a decent ui experience but if you are looking for a good ui then Samsung ofc will be the best option. Conclusion - If you are looking for a phone for normal use and don't use camera that much then it's a great choice but OnePlus as a company is not offering you something special if you buy at by seeing their brand value and it's quite similar to Realme Mobiles.,NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:  Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.  Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.  Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.  Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.  Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.  Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.  In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.",POSITIVE

I got it on discount so keep an eye out",POSITIVE

"Got this phone on last day of sale with additional 3K coupan.Here is my candid feedback.  Pros: 1. Clean Operating system... No lag. My other phone is iphone13 and believe me the touch and navigation is like iOS. 2. Camera superb with 50x zoom. This is a killer. Front camera is quite OK. 3. Best battery backup... 5200mah does last for a day for medium usage. 4. Fast charging supported... 0 to 50percent in few minutes and to 100% also fast(sorry was not patient enough to exactly time it :) 5. Yes no charger... But similar mobiles with charger have poor performance (based on YT reviews) so phone is still value for money without charger. No offense to ppl who are complaining :) 6. Many people don't recognise this brand... I was a Honor8pro user so experienced the brand value. 7. Provides private space dual login. Great feature to separate work and personal logins with one phone. 8. Light weight and sleek design with curved display. 9. Good volume with dual speaker at top and bottom of phone. 10. Capsule feature near camera notch like iPhone. 11. Screen guard comes pre installed and back cover (transparent) comes in the box.  Cons: 1. I personally wanted white color, but for some reason it's priced 3K INR more that black. I guess due to demand & supply. 2. Brought separate charger with super charging... And I am not complaining due to above 'pros' :)",POSITIVE
"Excellent display,Light weight, no lag, excellent camera. You will be impressed with camera detailing(Main Camera). Potrait mode is so good. Ui animations and working are looking like apple ios. In-hand feel is so good, compact and lightweight. I have got this for around 18k with offers and exchange.  Many of the issues fixed with updates.  Many people don't know the worth of honor product in the past i have used honor8pro that device lasted me almost 7 years 2018-2024 oct.  Updates :comes with Android 14 and also it's 2 years not 2 versions as of now in my POV & research Google released Android 15 in Q2 2025 it will release Android 16. So, hope we will get 3 major version updates.  Gaming : I did causual gaming payback2, Rc20, etc runs smooth with no lags or frame drops at all with almost negligible heating compared to other phones. Only con : NO CHARGER and 100 watt charger is priced at 3000 and if we want to take take 35 watt charger but is out of stock every time. At present I am using Google's 30 watt charger and it is working fine and charges it pretty fast around 45-55 minutes. Edit :- Got 35 watt honor Charger from honor store, no heating issue, charges quickly. Trust me I don't think you can get the better deal in this price range. It's an overall package.",POSITIVE
"Been Using the Mighty Honor 200 from the Past 10 days & I am spellbound by the Performance of the phone , awestruck with the Photos captured . The Visuals of the Display are vivid & an eye feast to watch videos. The Best part is the camera of the phone ( 50MP Portrait + 50MP Telephoto lens + 12MP Wide & 50MP Selfie camera ) . The best camera setup in the price segment. What I love the most is the Honor has collaborated with Studio Harcourt renewed for capturing Portraits of Hollywood Stars & Celebrities. They together brought 3 stunning filters to capture studio level portraits. I have shared a few pictures captured using the Harcourt filters. The output is stunningly marvelous. Posting them directly. No filters added & no colour correction done. Most importantly we don't have any photography skills. It's all the magic of the Camera & Harcourt Filters. If you are looking for the Phone to capture best Portraits , Honor200 is Undoubtedly the best choice. The Telephoto lens is outstanding . you could capture crisp photos even in 50X Zoom. The last 4 pictures , I have attached are captured from the same spot ( Ultrawide , 1X , 10X & 50X Zoom ) You could see the names of the boards captured clearly in 50X zoom. Coming to the selfie camera , you could capture beautiful selfies with 50MP selfie camera. you could record 4K videos using both Rear & Front camera . Dula video recording , slow motion video recording , Time lapse , Solo cut are the other camera options you could found. In Camera Department , Honor 200 is the complete package. Apart from the camera Yu can have the Honor Eye comfort Display with 3840Hz PWM Dimming for utmost eye care. Silicon -Carbob Battery with 5200mAh with 100W Wired charging . The UI is so smooth with Magic OS 8.0. The best part with Magic OS is , it pefectly synchronizes with the Hardware of the phone & you will never faces any issue with performance. I have been using Honor20 from the past 5 years & it still working like a charm , not even once I faced an issue like phone lagging . Thanks to Magic OS. There are so many Ai features that could make your life so easier with daily tasks. . I am not a Hardcore gamer . You could smoothly play games & the Graphics are loading good in BGMI. I haven't played for long hours to check the performance while gaming.  Positives ----------- 1) camera 2) Display 3) Charging 4) Beautiful Design 5) Magic OS  Cons ------ Charger could have Included in the Box",POSITIVE
"I recently upgraded to the OnePlus 12, and it has exceeded all my expectations! The sleek design and premium build quality are immediately noticeable. The display is vibrant and crisp, making every interaction a visual delight. Performance-wise, this phone is a powerhouse. Whether I'm multitasking, gaming, or streaming videos, everything runs seamlessly without a hitch.The camera setup is phenomenal, capturing stunning photos in various lighting conditions. The battery life is impressive too, lasting me through a full day of heavy usage with ease. The fast charging feature is a game-changer, getting me back to full power in no time.OxygenOS is smooth and intuitive, adding to the overall fantastic user experience. OnePlus has truly outdone themselves with the OnePlus 12. I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for top-notch performance and cutting-edge features! Sound quality is excellent, providing a rich audio experience whether I'm on a call or listening to music. Plus, I haven't experienced any heating issues, even with prolonged use. OxygenOS is smooth and intuitive, adding to the overall fantastic user experience.",POSITIVE
"Product is definitely worth flagship segment,, i also had doubt. Before buying. But its undoubtedly a good phone. No heating issue, charging speed is good, fingerprint sensor work extremely fast, no issue with connectivity where other brand struggle a lot to get network in some places.. display is far better and ui is butterly smooth with lots of features..",POSITIVE
"Everything about this product is great. Great Camera, display, chipset, speakers, haptics built quality and awesome battery backup. Got a clean OS experience as well. The most important thing is the in hand feel. Simply superp. Please note that this is not a light weight device and the black colour looks fabulous at the same time slippery as well. Images won't justify the beauty of silky black varient. The curve on the display is very subtle compared to Moto phones. Using this device for almost 2 months now and no heating issues faced till time. Also receiving the OTA updates frequently. Im happy with my device.",POSITIVE
"TLDR; Great phone for buyers who are looking for a well-rounded phone which can do a bit of everything, but don't buy it if your top priority is the camera. I have judged the camera harshly because cameras are important in flagships.  EDIT 1: A second update addressed some of the issues in the camera and fixed it. Some of the issues still remain (like overprocessing of photos indoors) but camera performs slightly better now so I'll increase the camera rating. Kudos to OnePlus for the prompt action.  Display - 7.5/10 Camera - 7.5/10 Performance - 9/10 Software - 8/10 Battery - 9.5/10 Connectivity - 9/10  I upgraded from my OP9R to this and got a nice exchange bonus out of it. I had briefly used a Pixel 8 Pro as well, and while the software and camera were superior than the OP12, their hardware was outdated and I faced a lot of connectivity issues so I ended up returning the P8P.  Note: I will say that when it comes to the overall phone experience and my personal requirements, OnePlus 12 is better than Pixel 8 Pro in my opinion and also ₹35k cheaper.  This phone is already competitively priced so I got a good deal out of it. Here are my initial impressions -  1. ACCESSORIES: Getting a charger and a phone case in 2024 out of the box makes me really happy. The case is okay but I would recommend getting a better one. The charger is big and heavy as it's 100W.  2. DISPLAY: The display is - clarity and quality wise fantastic, and any media you play in a higher resolution will look phenomenal. The brightness is also quite ample even under full sunlight conditions. Although 4500 nits is misleading but when you access HDR content, you will witness it's not entirely a gimmick. A display this good at this price is commendable.  The display is also CURVED, which is worst thing about it. This is the first curved display phone I've used and it's a bad experience for me. The light glares on the curved parts break the immersion while watching videos or browsing, photo editing can be a pain, causes problems in copy-pasting texts, gathers a lot of dust and not to mention how they are susceptible to more damages even with a good case on. It gets worse in sunlight. It will take some getting used to but I will never like it.  3. CAMERA: Camera has good clarity (the 10-bit mode can further enhance picture quality) but is also frustrating at times. There are a lot of moments when it overexposes, over sharpens and messes up the white balance in certain parts of photos after processing. I've had to manually tweak the exposure settings to get the scenes right a lot of times. Rear camera seflies indoors, sky pictures and sceneries with a lot of dynamic range come out weird after processing sometimes. The whole point of Hasselblad tuning is that the photos should be true-to-life. Sometimes pictures come out too warm indoors. Outdoors they perform better. I have had to use the Master Mode on Auto to take some pictures so that the processing does not ruin the picture. The downside of Master Mode is that your photos will end up looking a bit bland (because there's no post-processing happening) and it does not handle dynamic ranges well.  QUICK TIP: Turn off the ProXDR mode from the inbuilt gallery settings. It exaggerates photo quality on your display but is useless outside your gallery once you upload those photos somewhere.  Night mode is okay and gets the job done but don't expect it to perform a miracle with bad lighting conditions. Portrait mode is fantastic, edge-detection is very well-tuned. The Pro mode is where this camera shines and makes the use of the camera hardware but the majority won't use it. The glass coating on the camera is very susceptible to damage because it covers a better part of your phone's back so you will need to buy a good case.  Digital zoom is not very good in my opinion considering IQOO 12 has done a much better job with it while being significantly cheaper.  Video recordings from the rear camera come out clear enough and the audio quality is also good. But when you're switching lenses for zooming in, you'll notice a bit of stutter and a slight change in the colour gradient. When you're zooming in a lot, the camera takes 3-5 seconds before registering a focus object and detecting it properly. Super stable mode works well but only with 60fps. 30fps recording mode is not that smooth, with sub-par stabilization and stutters a lot when switching lenses. These have been an ongoing issue for a few generations and one would have expected OP to resolve it by now.  Front camera is pretty average (even more disappointing indoors). It works well in daylight but indoor pictures look like they're taken from a mid-range phone. They did tune the front camera to have a wider angle which is good. Video recording from the front camera doesn't allow 60 fps but allows 4K recording now.  OP clearly needs to work in the camera department in future updates. Their camera algorithms are quite behind compared to the current industry standards even though the phone has good camera hardware.  Overall camera is okay for daily use but if it's your main priority, this phone might not be for you.  4. CONNECTIVITY AND CALL QUALITY - Did not notice any call drops, 5G works well and the person on the other end heard my voice very loud and clear. Bluetooth and WIFI are working well.  IR blaster works but don't expect it to be compatible with every device. Gets the job done regardless and a super convenient feature that I wish more phones had these days.  5. BATTERY AND CHARGING - It is fantastic. Can last a full day on medium to heavy usage, and 1.5 days on light usage. They have also introduced battery health management features which is an added bonus. I had to try really hard to drain the battery completely.  Charging time is 25-27 mins after full drainage. The smart charging feature to conserve battery health over time is a nice addition. Haven't used the wireless charging or reverse wireless charging so wouldn't be able to comment on it.  My current SOT shows up as almost 9 hrs and 1d 5 hrs since last charge with 7% charge left. Battery is crazy good as you can see.  6. PERFORMANCE: Top-notch performance, phone feels super fast and snappy. Got only slightly warm during gaming (I played CoDM), continuous camera operations and charging. Their new cooling system is proving to be very good.  Read and write speeds, app installations are also super fast.  7. SOFTWARE: Oxygen OS 14 has some very good parts (quick launch, smart sidebar, file docker etc), and some bad parts. There are some Android 14 features that have not been implemented correctly (why do I have to manually set refresh rates for all the apps even after selecting the high refresh rate option?) or are absent (where are the lock screen customisations?). OOS14 is still proving to be a good experience for me overall.  I have not encountered any bugs in my day to day usage and every operation on the phone has been seamless so far. Honestly, I expected OP12 to be quite buggy at launch but I'm happy that they are learning from their mistakes.  OP has managed to give great features in an extremely competitive price and I would say I'm mostly happy with my purchase (except maybe the camera). China models will see AI features soon and I hope global launches follow the suit.",NEGATIVE
"Pros ---- 1. Fast charging 1-100% in 28min. Never think about low battery. 2. Super steady zoom 3. Slightly Curved screen providing comfortable holding 4. Fast-fluid-bloatfree os. I was a bit sceptical of the os after the code merger but I think its for betterment as now the camera is superb. 5. All day battery 6. The processor is very optimised and hardly reach 40 degrees even while running two heavy games simultaneously - marvel snap and mobile legends. 7. I love the floating window - its a gem of multi-tasking. 8. I adore the camera. Its fast and accurate. The portrait images will make even iphone hide in shadow. Master mode is awesome - once you start using it, u ll understand how good it feels to see natural colours. 9. Exceptionally bright colour accurate screen. Never had any problem in outdoor visibility. Cons: ----- 1. Some old bugs still exist wherein switching the alert slider while google chrome is opened will trigger search function. 2. Internet browser is the only blaotware and its not uninstallable. 3. Nothing other...",POSITIVE

"I snagged the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival for an unbeatable price of 45,000, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in every way!  Screen: The display is absolutely stunning – crisp, vibrant, and the colors pop like never before. Watching videos or scrolling through photos is a treat for the eyes. No complaints here!  Hanging: Zero issues with hanging or lagging. This phone handles multitasking like a champ. Switching between apps is smooth, and I haven't experienced any frustrating delays.  Battery: The battery life is surprisingly impressive. I can go a full day with normal usage, and it still has juice left in the tank. No more anxiously searching for a charger midday – a definite win!  Comfort: The sleek design makes it a pleasure to hold, and the phone is just the right weight. It feels premium and comfortable in my hand, making it a joy to use for extended periods.  Image Quality: The camera on the iPhone 13 is a true standout. The photos are sharp, and the night mode is a game-changer for capturing memories in low light. Selfies have never looked this good!  Color: I went for the classic Midnight color, and it's elegant and timeless. The finish adds a touch of sophistication, and it doesn't attract fingerprints like some other phones I've had in the past.

"I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.  The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”  The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.  If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!",POSITIVE

My review : Performance [ 4/5 ] - Gaming Performance good but you'll see some frame drops and lag somewhere while using but a great gaming experience at this price. Camera [ 3/5 ] - Very limit features in camera app and quality is also not good and you'll find better options in market at 20k. Battery [ 5/5 ] - Awesome battery life and 80w fast charging is crazy and will take about 40m-60m for 0-100%. Display [ 4.5/5 ] - Good display quality in this price segment. Software [ 4/5 ] - Somewhere a decent ui experience but if you are looking for a good ui then Samsung ofc will be the best option. Conclusion - If you are looking for a phone for normal use and don't use camera that much then it's a great choice but OnePlus as a company is not offering you something special if you buy at by seeing their brand value and it's quite similar to Realme Mobiles.,NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:  Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.  Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.  Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.  Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.  Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.  Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.  In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.",POSITIVE
Camera quality: very good Charging speed: very fast Fingerprint reader: very quicky Weight: light weight Heating issue: didn't tried gaming so not sure about high level performance but for normal use it is not heating at all,NEGATIVE
"I purchased it for my sister, she is not a heavy user. She uses it for pictures, social media and youtube mostly. So She is happy with this mobile. It looks sleek, and colour also matches India’s current political situation 😊. Camera is satisfactory. Battery is long lasting which is nice to have. 5g woks excellent. So overall it’s a nice phone. I got it on discount so keep an eye out",POSITIVE
Pros: Good battery backup Decent camara in well light condition Cons: Poor processer and performance Worest photos in low light condition Faced lack in finer print sensor Finally not worthy under 20k segment Best option is Poco x7 comparing with this.,NEGATIVE
"OnePlus are the very best manufacturers of mobile devices, bar none.",POSITIVE
Don't go for this device..am wonder about that in product's it's clearly mentioned that only for sale and warranty in India..then why this seller selling in uae ?🤬waste of time,NEGATIVE
"Phone looks good, but no phone cover or charger like seen in some reviews",NEGATIVE
"This phone is the definition of versatility. I’m in love with this device. Amazing experience while binge watching shows amazing display and sound quality. The processor is super fast, making gaming on the Gaming Outfit flawless. No heating, no lags just pure fun! The camera captures every detail, and the battery holds up like a champ. Stylish, functional, and pocket-friendly. 10/10 would buy again! 😍",POSITIVE
The phone is pathetic it keeps getting restart and reset on its own. Worst phone and worst service experience from the brand and amazon as well. Shame on amazon and HMD,NEGATIVE
"HMD Fusion is a breath of fresh air in this ocean of similar looking smartphones. It is not fighting the spec war like others but is trying to be different with it's bundled Outfits. The build quality of the phone is incredible and it attarcts eyeballs. It is a conversation starter and people are like what's this different looking phone.  In my first few days, I like the performance of the phone. The camera is excellent especially the 108MP mode which takes some incredibly detailed photos but you need to be good at editing to bring rhe most out of the 108MP full resolution shots. Otherwise, you can stick to the normal mode that takes 12MP photos. I'll update the review with images when i click something shareable. 😅  Coming to the outfits, they are good to have. The flashy outfit is a solid looking case as well and comes with a built in ring light that can illuminate 16M colours and enhance your selfies in tricky lighting situations. The gaming outfit is great for casual gaming. Not all games support gamepads and those that do take time to find a match with other players playing with gamepads. It's excellent for casual gamers and you will like the whole new experience of gaming with a gamepad.  I'll update the review after a few days/weeks. As of now, i am very satisfied with my purchase. I will recommend buying it at No Cost Emi option with select cards that offer around 3-3.5k discounts.",POSITIVE
"I’m honestly so impressed with how versatile this phone is. The Smart Outfits are such a game-changer......especially the Flashy Outfit and the Gaming Outfit. Seriously, what were they thinking while coming up with these brilliant ideas? Genius! The camera quality is top-notch, the battery life is super reliable, and the phone never lags, no matter how much I use it. Best phone under budget. Cool, quirky, and everything you need in one device! Highly recommend it! 😊",POSITIVE
"I have been using this phone s my primary device for a week now and here is my review: Build: The phone feels heavy in hand; the weight distribution is however, good. It feels sturdy even without the cover attached; using the phone that way makes it feel unique. When you apply the cover, the phone feels bulky. Display: The display is big and bright. It is HD and they could have provided full HD at this price. I had issues with outdoor viewing as the auto brightness mode does not work properly many times. This may be fixed with updates. In box contents: The box provides everything except screen protector (a pre-attached cover, . There is no pre-applied screen protector but due to the design, tempered glass that fits is easily available in the market. One more surprise was a C-C charging cable. Add-ons: The add-on flashy outfit really works well for selfies and pictures through main camera. The gaming outfit also feels responsive. A few games are supported as of now which cn be accessed through the pre-installed aptoide app. Camera: The daylight photos of main camera come out well although a bit on the softer side. The camera provides 3x zoom but not in the portrait mode. The night mode is very aggressive and I liked the images that came out. The video output is full HD at 30 or 60 fps. UI: There are few pre-installed apps; the experience is smooth otherwise. I faced a few non-responsive screen issues especially while using youtube. But they no longer exist once I changed the refresh rate to high. Battery: The battery easily lasts a day especially when using the normal screen refresh rate. I have seen a slightly higher drop after changing to high refresh rate. The drain when phone is idle at night I also higher now (nearly 7-8%). The provided charger also charges the phone very slow. Overall, it is a unique phone with few setbacks some of which can be resolved through updates. Till now, I have not received any software updates. The outfits make it an interesting experience. I am happy that HMD has tried to make phones interesting again.",POSITIVE
"Free outfits should be selected before adding to bag ,else free outfits won't be given to customer , once u select and add to bag and move on outfits amount would be 0 in final before payment , so plz select outfits.and.add.to.bag to get thm free of cost",NEGATIVE

"No camera phone only use for storage phone like a dabba only.hardware issues reboot and hanging too much, can't personalised your own. Phone price is 12279 only and unnecessary giving freebies which are not usable at all. But your own compromise.",NEGATIVE
One of the best mobile you can get in this range! The camera quality is good.. It has small display at back which if you have desk job and you listen to songs or see notification or anything.. It is good and action key is my favourite as I can customize as I want. Charging is fast and battery power is also good. Clean android and amazing display also.. Hoping they keep improving with time! No heating issue! In display fingerprint sensor is also amazing. No issue with connectivity 👍,POSITIVE
"The design and feel of this smartphone is incredible with matt glass back and curved screen. The steel metal rails on edges are shiny and look really premium. Great build quality overall.  Camera island gives a nice symmetrical look, also good grip area. The back screen is very useful for using main camera for photo. It also has Always on display option for back display. Could have been more customisable with cutom images/more animations.  Performace is great, no lags, no heat very efficient 4nm tsmc processor with only 2.5 ghz so no problem with battery life. Charging speed is very good 66 watts. It's my first 5g phone and experience is great. No battery issue with 5g very efficient there as well.  Beautiful Amoled screen is smooth, reponsive and vibrant. Brightness is decent. Great software experience. Action button is super useful! What a great addition.  Dual speaker are crisp and very useful. Sarisfied with camera quality, as I'm not a huge camera person, it's difficult to judge for me. OIS helps. Also, good vibration motor.  For cons -  No micro sd. Have to get 256 GB variant because of that. But, storage provided is good quality and fast ufs3.1  The button place is such that I accidently press the opposite button. Volume is opposite to lock and action button. It took some getting used to for me personally.",POSITIVE
"I have been using the phone for the last 3 months. Battery backup is huge, you would not get such powerful battery in anyother phone, Inscreen fingerprint sensor is mind blowing. Performance is great, never faced any issue, does not hand, no lagging - be advised I do not play high graphic hungry games like CODM or any other battle royales. There is absolutely no heating issue. Touch quality is smooth. One crutial thing that Lava needs to work on is the camera. They have provided the wide angle camera which is great but the issue lies in the primary camera. For apparent no reasons the camera would go out of focus and even after trying for many minutes will not correct itself. Another thing is the zoom, as soon as you go above 2x, the quality will go towards bad and light capturing decreases. Apart from these issues, the phone is great. the mini screen in the back is a nice addition.",POSITIVE
"I am proud of this company Lava.Because I was previously using Lava Agni 2. And my family members also have phones from the same company, Lava.Every phone from this company is working in the best possible way. And currently I have bought Lava Agni 3.And currently, while using the Lava Agni 3, every feature of this phone is surprising me. Because this company has made the best phone for such a low price.Lava Agni 3 has the best camera, best processor, best stereo speakers, best display, best battery life, best design and many more.... Best. Best.. Best I love India 🇮🇳 and. I LOVE LAVA #proudly Indian.",POSITIVE
"This is a very good phone with all latest features like curved display, fast processor, big memory size ( i have purchased 8GB/256GB ) 5000 MAH battery, Dual ampled, One year replacement warranty. And the best is it is Make in India. Value for money.",POSITIVE
"Awesome mobile in this range, best decision, but Camera colour are good but not too much good.., battery is 5000mh but not enough because of two display. Fast charging, best quality, I use this mobile from 2 months and no problem I face.",POSITIVE
"Wow.. amazing phone in every aspect.. I have seen many bad reviews about camera on YouTube, but I still bought it by seeing other good qualities. But believe me, the camera is so good both front n back. Super clarity curved display. No other company can give you this much clarity n features at this price. Its worth more than its price. Fast charging. I bet you will be happy buying Lava Agni 3. Proudly Indian smartphone.",POSITIVE
Overall phone experience is good but camera performance is poor . It has problem with camera optimization. You have to take 10 photos then you will get one or two good photos . Otherwise phone is good hepatics soo good .look wise osm. Sound quality is descent. I face No heating issue. Good connectivity . it will give you a primium experience in this price range .,POSITIVE
"Excellent mobile phone at affordable price. Configuration is very high. Battery is fabulous, charges phone in just 27 minutes from 2% to 100%. Rest all is good. Must buy product if you want to buy new one right now.",POSITIVE
"After using this phone for a month, I can say it's a great choice, especially for the price. The first thing I noticed was the weight—it feels surprisingly light despite housing a large 5500 mAh battery, which is impressive for long-lasting power without adding bulk. The phone is slim, comfortable to hold, and fits well in the hand, making it ideal for daily use.  The camera quality is good for standard photos but has limitations. While it handles basic shots decently, the wide-angle video quality falls short, and there’s no 60 fps option in 4K, which could be a drawback for those who love detailed video work. Additionally, I noticed the camera app tends to lag or even get stuck after taking multiple portrait-mode shots, which disrupts the experience a bit.  Overall, it's a solid budget option with good design, reasonable performance, and decent battery life, though the camera could use a few software improvements for smoother functionality.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus Nord CE 4 is arguably the best phone in the under-25k price range. It features a massive 5500mAh battery, and the 100W fast charging is a significant plus. The battery easily lasts 7-8 hours with regular use, including apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and YouTube. The speakers are loud and crisp, delivering an excellent audio experience. OxygenOS 15 is buttery smooth, adding to the overall premium feel of the device.  Overall, I absolutely love this phone!",POSITIVE
"Really like the build quality, Camera, Sound and performance. Somehow I am expecting much from picture quality but it is okay. As the performance is wonderful.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus Nord CE 4 in Celadon Marble is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a balance of style and performance at a reasonable price. The Celadon Marble color gives the phone a premium, unique look that stands out, and it feels great in hand with its sleek, lightweight design.  With 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the phone handles multitasking smoothly, even with multiple apps running. The performance is snappy and responsive, thanks to its optimized processor and OxygenOS, which offers a clean, intuitive user experience. The battery life is impressive, lasting through a full day of moderate use, and fast charging is a real convenience.  The camera quality is solid for this price range, delivering",POSITIVE
"I've been using this phone for about a week now and I feel that it's super awesome. Let's talk about the pros and cons : Pros 1. The display is pretty bright and amazing. It can play HDR videos upto 1440p in YouTube and you can set your device to brighten up while playing HDR videos in the setting. 2. The UI is very smooth. It has a lot of features too! 3. The cameras are awesome! They click such amazing photos and shoot amazing videos. It clicks natural photos. There are modes like timelapse,slow-mo,etc too. It has OIS, which only records at 1080p 60fps. There is a mode in the video section named 'ultra steady' by which you can use OIS. 4. The performance of the phone is amazing and is well optimised! 5. The built is quality is nice too! 6. The charging is fabulous! It has a 100 watt charger in the box which can full charge your phone in 25 minutes when smart rapid charging is on. The battery backup is just amazing. This phone gives a whopping 1.5-2 days of battery backup. 7. There is a feature that you might not know, you can adjust the intensity of brightness of the torch by pressing and holding the torch symbol, just like iphones. 8. The speakers are loud AF! After updating there is this mode where you could ultra boost volume upto 300% which is crazy! And it's very-very loud.  Cons 1. It can't play 2160p in HDR. 2. It doesn't support OIS on 4k 30fps and the OIS video has very slight unnoticeable jitterness. 3. The animation is kinda slow but smooth for me, so I changed it in developer options. 4. The frame and back is made up of plastic.  The phone is pretty awesome and the cons don't bother me 😄. I'm a tech enthusiast so you can trust on me!",POSITIVE

"This is post 3 days of using of phone and simply couldn't resist myself from writing this review. Got the Razor Green 12 GB 512 GB for 32K post Bank discount. Adding some context before diving into my experience. I was an S22 Ultra user and ditched the same for OnePlus 12 SD8G3. I wanted an add on phone for office use and for gaming (BGMI & MKX). Got this one post going through round of comparisons against IQOOs out there. Not I just had one sim in the phone as I was using it. So coming straight to how I rate this phone. It is a 5/5 for me. Looks: 4/5 ✌️✌️✌️✌️ Display: 5/5 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Touch Response: 5/5 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈 Performance: 5/5 ✨✨✨✨✨ Gaming performance: 5/5 👍👍👍👍👍 Speaker Output: 5/5 ( very decent) Battery: 10/5 ( Simply marvellous) Charging speed: 15/5 (no comments) Camera: 4/5 (boosted this up from 3 to 4 based off overall happiness with the phone and considering the price factor) OS: 4/5 (-1 because of few preloaded apps) Finger print scanner: 5/5  So what I loved: Display and performance crisp and buttery smooth. OS is clean too to the most. SD7+G3 takes on any tasks thrown on it with ease. No hassles in multitasking. Got July security patch as of yesterday so all good on that front too. Now speaking about what I'm in love with - Being an S22 Ultra user I must say the biggest pain point has been battery since day 1. Max gaming time 3.5 Hrs. in the initial days which reduced to 1.5 over a span of 2 years. Stand-by was crazy bad too on S22 Ultra. This Lil gizmo GT 6T is a dream in this case. 3 days of game play BGMI 5 Hrs. each day and was left with 22% of juice still remaining each time. And post sleep of 6 hrs. the phone still retained 17% of charge. This already is insane in my perspective. Now coming to the charging aspect, this is unimaginable. Lightning fast... 17% - 100% in 22 minutes. Speechless in this front. Sammy used to take like 1 hr and 10 mins. in the initial days and post an year and half I really don't know. Gaming done without gtmode. Frame rate was set to auto adaptive. BGMI played in Smooth Extreme+. Brightness at ~45%. No throttling or heating. It got slightly warm at a point (really no where close to be called as heating) and then cooled too which is 😍😍😍. WhatsApp, FB, Insta, Gmail, O365, Teams and all other apps on the background. So you can go for this one blindfolded if you are looking for a phone with great backup and performance (gaming performance). I hope this is helpful. What I didn't like: Given all of above a 3.5 mm slot was expected. And sound output in headphones could have been better. I used Sony WH1000XM3 for gaming and Wf1000XM4 for listening to music and watching movie to test the output. Again you can hear all the footsteps and minute details and same applies to music if not all details but covers 90% of it but somewhere lacks the loudness factor by a bit and no Dolby Atmos so less to mention there. Lastly, I didn't cover anything on cam perspective because I was really not looking at this phone from that aspect and me sharing my experience on that front will definitely make no sense as the comparison will be against S22 Ultra here and this reaches no where close to it which is completely fine given it is not even 1/4th of the price for which I had bought S22 Ultra. That said both front and rear cam are decent is all I can say from price point perspective. Overall this is a bang on deal from my perspective and would definitely recommend going for it if you are not cam centric and looking for a great performer!",NEGATIVE
"Great curved screen and elegant design, amazing performance! Good for BGMI game to play @90fps(tested) without any lag by enabling GT mode🤩🥳  Cameras are big and entire back looks very premium but, the brand provided case is of no use because of its big space to showcase the cameras entire area😤 it looks awkward with that case on🤮 I recommend The GiftKart liquid silicon back case(black) which costed me 299/- its a good case that provides utmost security and also proper grip, it gives a premium look and feel for the mobile by covering all the unnecessary gaps..  I am glad that I have availed the discount coupon of 7k that was available for some period on amazon and bought the mobile for ₹23,998/- and I am super happy🥳😍 Great sound and screen, the cameras also amazing and captures best shots📸🏞️  I have used all brands from Nokia to Apple. My majority mobiles was of Nokia, LG, Samsung, Motorola and Apple 5S.. Then One+ 3t, iPhone Xr and now from last 2 years with iPhone 12.  I have bought Mi max, Vivo, Poco X3, Realme GT Neo 3 and Motorola g54 mobiles for my wife so far to play PUBG/BGMI often with my kids as well and now bought this Realme GT 6t🥳😁..  I have used lots of mobile phones and now I can say this is the best, one can get under 31k price tag! If you get it lower than that, you’re damn lucky🥳😍😎🕺🏻…  Note: The design, looks and colours are depends on individual tastes but, the mobile phone is definitely a power packed all rounder🔥🔥🔥",POSITIVE

"I was searching for smartphone for a long time because my old smartphone (2019 bought) becoming aged and getting slowed down, on my research i was impression that either i would go with a lower mid range smartphone or a premium (preferable samsung) smartphone.  So i was not sure that what i have to purchase but my preferences was (in descending order) Battery 🔋+ charging speed Performance (upgrade from SD855) Storage Screen brightness (out visibility must be good) 5G bands atleast 10 (most usable) UI (software, atleast acceptable)  Overall if these check boxes are ticked ✅ (rest things comes complimentary).  So this query bring me the following smartphones at similar prices. 1. POCO F6 12/512 2. Realme GT 6T 8/256 3. OnePlus Nord 4 8/128  However Poco is powerful among these with FLAT SCREEN but we all know why many avoid poco, so left with two options Realme or OnePlus then again OnePlus green line mass problem forced me to think twice and decided to go with Realme GT 6T with curved screen (with the thought that if i disliked it even slightly, I'll sell it within days).  So Waited for BBD/Geart indian festival SALES Keeping all phones on list because if prices get's uneven (due to massive discount) then preferences will again change.  The day arrived got hige discount on POCO but till then i had made my mind to go with Realme (overall good software with everything balanced and compromising on Screen because it's a curved screen).  Ordered this RELAME GT 6T 8/256GB variant (Green looks sober, classy and not too shiny)  Then new fear unlock seeing Delivery frauds (some accuses seller, some accuses delivery partner and so on) researched about this. And was waiting for delivery with All the guns (safety measures) loaded.  Parcel arrived Talked with delivery guy, told him the seller/delivery frauds, he was a really nice guy, listened carefully and helped me to check ✅ parcel thoroughly after inspection we concluded that parcel (high security packaging) is TEMPERED, is strongly recommended me to cancel because it is high-value package so don't take risk  We proceeded with cancellation provided OTP for cancellation, order cancelled successfully. Within seconds he realises that package we looking was different and we cancelled my package, i was like (abbey, Harmonium) oh brother. Then i asked to check my parcel packaging and to my surprise that too was tempered (high security packaging considered tempered with when white line don't appear clearly or turns color PINK/GREEN with clearly visible side numbers) so i was relaxed that it's okay  But i had second thought and asked him to see if he can still deliver my package, he was looking to try to deliver package even after cancellation, he tried to send otp for delivery but no luck because OTP not received (tried multiple times),  I lost the hope and about ti leave the spot then he told me to wait, he called to warehouse operator asked him if he can mark this cancelled package as delivered, he said YES, within seconds he marked order delivered and package handover to me. Then i realised OTP thing also caused due to network, so Turned on flight ✈️ mode on then off, just afte that recieved 5 OTP messages. Told him this, he said no problem backend delievery system don't need OTP,  I Left the spot, thinking that i have made a big (costly) mistake, because Amazon don't offer open box delivery and often deny Returns (service centre replacement policy).  Reached into room, placed package on table, turned on Camera, inspected everything on camera. I was too nervous to open the box.  Just started to open and when i seen phone box with security seal and plastic sheet over the box (some relief).  Carefully open phone box and took BEAST into my Hand 👌🏽👌🏽, That look was amazing 🤩 Everything sorted.  💥🌟💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨✨💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨ DEVICE-REVIEW-HERE DEVICE-REVIEW-HERE  Review part: • Battery [9hrs with 5G always on with auto Refresh Rate and with mixed Wi-Fi+5G usage 12+hrs]🔋+charging (I'm not going back to slow charging again ever) • Performance is really beast (more than expected) • Screen brightness 🔅 SUPER AMAZING • UI (after removing and disabling bloats) amazing • Speaker and camera also good (but low light camera performance is not good)  Overall I'm with this beast for next few years (maybe 5yrs) if everything went as usual.  Build quality is plastic and finger prints are visible if Cover or skin not applied.  However i still feel if this had FLAT screen it would be blind suggestion for everyone (normal/casual user).  Call quality is excellent, Google dialer comes default but can be changed to Odialer for call recording.  I felt if someone who use multiple apps (more than 10 except calls/sms/email/Play Store) for daily usage, needs to tweak battery settings for every single app to achieve optimal battery backup else would face battery drain issues (faced this but that was once in a month kind thing).  Overall no battery drain or charging issues, no issues with calls (I'm using jio). Day light video/photography is better.  Overall a BEAST I bought 8/256 @ 26k (with card discount). Please vote up 👍🏽 if you find it helpful.  Thanks",NEGATIVE

"Excellent 5G phone for 9000/-. Sturdy and visually pleasing overall, especially back panel. Handset-Specs very good. Night pics are very clear. Processing & routine tasks are butter smooth, in fact very fast when compared to my old 4G handset. I am a non-gamer so, did not try any games. However, Charger adapter is flimsy - It is ON for a second then OFF... ON....OFF. May be incompatible to standard sockets. I used a old charger... good enough. All in all, I am happy with NOKIA G42 5G.",POSITIVE
"I purchased assuming it’s a new product. However, on the fourth day of operation the flashlight came on and did not go off in spite of powering off the phone. On taking it to Nokia Services centre, it was informed by the technician that the phone seems to be second hand as the phone did not have original screws inside implying it was a second hand phone. Even on checking their site, the Service Centre verified that there was no warranty available. This is cheating of customers by vendors without any verification by Amazon.",NEGATIVE

"First of all, a word of caution. The Nokia G42 5G does not come with a dedicated SD card slot. You can use 2 sims or 1 sim + 1 SD card. Pre sales inquiry on both nokia website and Amazon said it comes with 2 sims and a dedicated SD card slot. Imagine my horror when I noticed it on unpacking. That's why deduction of 2 stars. Since it looks so beautiful and photos were incredibly beyond my expectations, I decided to keep it. Night photos are incredibly amazing. First tried to return it, but was caught in a match between Amazon and Nokia on who will handle this problem. Support person from both said they will call back but never did. But the phone is amazing.  Update: never buying again. Problem with motherboard, cost of replacing is 9000, and the joke is that warrenty is a royal 1 month. 12000 phone repair cost is 9000. What a joke 🤣",POSITIVE
Good and quality,POSITIVE
"I've been using the realme Narzo N61 (Marble Black, 4GB RAM+64GB Storage) for a few weeks, and while it shows promise, it falls short in some areas.  Pros:  1. 90Hz Eye Comfort display: Smooth visuals, reduced eye strain. 2. IP54 dust and water resistance: Added durability. 3. 48-month fluency promise: realme's commitment to software updates. 4. Charger included: Convenient. 5. Affordable price point.  Cons:  1. Performance issues: Device can be slow, especially with multitasking. 2. Occasional lag and freezing: Frustrating experience. 3. Display touch issues: Unresponsive or inaccurate touch registration. 4. Limited storage (64GB): May require frequent cleaning or expansion.  Key Features:  - 6.5"" HD+ display - MediaTek Helio G35 processor - 4GB RAM, 64GB storage (expandable up to 1TB) - 48MP primary camera, 2MP macro, 2MP depth sensor - 5000mAh battery - Android 12 (Realme UI 3.0)  Verdict:  The realme Narzo N61 has potential, but its performance and display issues hold it back. If you prioritize smooth performance and responsive touch, consider alternatives.  Recommendation:  Ideal for:  - Basic users (calling, texting, social media) - Casual gaming (non-demanding titles)  Not recommended for:  - Demanding gamers - Multitaskers - Those seeking seamless performance  Rating Breakdown:  - Display: 3.5/5 (touch issues) - Performance: 3.0/5 (slow, laggy) - Battery: 4.0/5 - Camera: 3.5/5 - Value: 4.5/5  Suggestions for realme:  1. Optimize software for better performance. 2. Improve display touch sensitivity. 3. Consider upgrading storage options.  Would I recommend this product? Only for basic users.  Please note that this review is based on my personal experience. Your mileage may vary.",NEGATIVE
Best mobile in budget range,POSITIVE
Everything is great but has slow internet access like even in high speed wifi the phone can only access slow speeds with buffering internet and only useful for small tasks like social media cannot handle huge tasks like gaming. Screen size is gud. Sound quality could be better but it sounds ok with single speaker,POSITIVE

Worst and screen also automatically operating and customer care also giving false information,NEGATIVE
This is Great mobile in this budget I bought this to gift my mother and She is really happy to use this. Thank you MI Battery performance is Topnotch,POSITIVE
Surprisingly good product for the price. I have generally purchased the flagship phones of OnePlus with the assumption that they are better than the Nord-series. I now stand corrected. The NORD CE range is definitely an economical range and not meant for heavy usage but the Nord series are more than capable of taking on heavy usage. The camera is not great but at the price point it is more than adequate. The phone is well built and looks good. The finger print reader is quick and efficient. Phone functionality being almost bare bones androrid is high on user friendliness. A definite buy!,POSITIVE
"Bought the phone a month ago. Safe to say at this price range, for me, it's banger. A fast and smooth software experience and tough and durable hardware.  The oxygen os 15 update made the software smoother and brought some cool features as well. Battery gives an excellent backup, charges quick, the display is great and flat. Also the metal design is unique.  The only downside, or might i say, a slight disappointment is the camera. Not that good at this price. Still and over-all great one. Not even noticeable to the average user. Apart from that, One plus nailed it.",POSITIVE
"This is my first OnePlus device, before this iam user of poco believe me oxygen OS is far better than miui/ Hyper os. It's lag free,and very smoothly work, battery is al great, camera is not upto mark but ok. Performance is next level iam loving with it😎",POSITIVE
"I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4. It is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. I bought this phone during Great Indian festival after so much research and doubts. I was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. I was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. I don't want to compromise in any one thing. So after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. But in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. Curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. Now i feel it was the best decision. Best features of this Nord 4 are- Design - I literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. I thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. It cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all. Performance - It has the best performance and able to play BGMI so smoothly. Flat screen helps so much in games also. Battery - If you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins. Camera - I felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. If camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, Samsung or Iphone which are camera centric. But then other areas you have to compromise. Trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos. Network - Being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. Never felt any Issues at all. Display - It has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.  This review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for Oneplus Nord 4 for sure. Greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....  (If any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)",POSITIVE
"I've never had a OnePlus device before so I'll be totally unbiased over my experience for this phone since I bought it by the time of of first day launch🤗  1) Design: (9.5/10 Subjective) I love it but t's subjective is you prefer a glass built over a metal or the dual tone colours/texture appeals you less or more, but ultimately it's one of the most eye catching designs launched this year apart from the Nothing phones that has managed to attain a premium appearance in a very simple unibody structure.  2) Performance: (8.5/10) This is what makes it one of the top competitors within the 30k lineup phones. I personally play a lot of gatcha games like Genshin, Honkai and Wuthering Waves, over fps shooting so I would definitely say that gatcha games being heavier in graphics, Nord 4 is capable to provide the most efficient gaming. Practically speaking if you avoid those YouTube reviews with AnTuTu, any android phone would at some point face fps drop if you play in the highest settings and I do believe with what I've heard that even with high end processors like Snapdragon 7+ 3, OnePlus always limits it's potential which is why we do get to see some throttling, but on a long term it doesn't matter. If you are a daily user with 2-3 hours of heavy gaming per day or more with breaks after every 45 minutes to 1 hour of heavy graphic gameplay, then you could definitely have a great experience. If you are just a normal user, you can choose it blindly.  3) Built and UI: (9/10 for strength and quality but 7/10 for being expensive to replace) Ofcourse being metal you would expect a little bit of weight (around 200 grams) but you get used to it and it really feels much premium to feel that metallic weight in your hand. It might get really slippery and if it falls down it might not have scratches except for the glass portion around the camera but might face dents on the metal if the fall is too harsh, so I would suggest to have a back cover, and let's be honest no matter how premium the phone is even if it looks great, they are all at the end of the day sensitive and how you manage to care for it depends totally on you. Be responsible. And as I mentioned, it's going to be really expensive to replace a unibody metal frame if it's cracked or dented even if it's strong enough to work so be careful. As for the UI I've been a Xiaomi user so honestly I don't feel much different in terms of operating system with bloatware, but I really don't feel bothered by it as long as I'm able to disable it. I uninstalled and disabled not almost but EVERY single bloatware in this phone that I possibly could have including app market and even the gaming tool so now I don't get those security checks after installing apps and it feels as clean as any Flagship phone.  3) Battery: (8/10) It's good. Definitely better battery life than my iPhone BUT for how big the battery is, the Oxygen OS hasn't optimised it's battery life to it's maximum just as I mentioned before for its Processor but it's not a big deal. 5500mAH is something we see less as the price goes higher over handheld devices because they try to add more space for gimmicks like wireless charging which in my opinion is not very practical everytime unless you carry a wireless charger everywhere and they are really slow. But the wired charging in OnePlus with the 100 watt out of the box charger is great and it charges the device to full within 30 minutes tho I would suggest to toggle the option from Battery Health settings to charge it till 80 percentage so you can keep it's battery health stable for long. I hope they optimise it in the future updates but honestly it gives you around 7-8 hours of life with regular usage and even more if you are a light user which is more than enough considering that at some point you will need to charge your device any way.  4) Display: (8/10) It's a very smooth 120hz amoled panel with HDR support in Netflix that I never really use because I watch on my MacBook or the television (it's just better to watch anything on a bigger display over a phone to keep your visions safe) and an unnamed protection (Panda glass according to few sources) but I'll be practical over how much it actually matters. Being someone who has changed the displays in the past after getting it broken, it doesn't matter what Gorilla glass they put on your phone, it's a glass at the end of the day and if you are not being responsible enough by handling your phone with care, it's expected for your screen to face damage. Use a good tempered glass around 3-4 USD (200-400 INR) I won't suggest to go higher because no matter how expensive it is, even if it's able to handle a bend test, practically any tempered display is penetrable if it falls flat on a rough surface UNLESS you have a good thick back cover. Overall it's a good display but I feel that the brightness could be a bit bother outside if you live in a heavily bright environment. Personally I didn't face any issues for the time being as the peak brightness is really good in the sunlight but if you compare it to some cheaper devices, it might feel a little less.  5) Heating Stabilization: (9/10) I mean, it's metal? Ofcourse it's going to be hot DURING a gameplay but HEATING DOESN'T MEAN PERFORMANCE DROP. Also it's during the time when you are playing or doing some heavy task but the best part of metal is that it cools down as fast as it heats up and the cooling chamber in this phone is really efficient. Overall It's definitely better in terms of heat stabilization than any glass/plastic built phones for being a metal although I would say that, if you are travelling in a constantly hot temperature, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight for too long as it might get hot or else again, Use a back cover. BUT I'd also suggest to not use a back cover when doing some heavy gaming because it makes you loose the purpose of having a metal phone with such a good heating stabilization as plastic makes it harder to escape the heat.  6) Camera: (7/10 Subjective) This isn't my place but I would still give some opinion. It is decent and when I say that, it is actually not bad at all infact really good along it's limitations. It has a very natural tone on the back camera with a really good potrait mode and a decent front camera definitely better than a 25k phone but ofcourse with the specifications you see, there are limitations if you compare it to other phones in the same price. It's definitely better than Nothing 2a in terms of color and stability but not as close to camera centred phones like Vivo/Realme in the midrange but then again those phones lack either performance or the brand value, as OnePlus is much premium as a brand than Vivo/Realme even if they are from the same company. Again it is subjective and this phone in my opinion is rather a balance of performance along with the things you need in a midrange close-to-flagship phone rather than being an entire camera phone, but it's still really good even with the limitations of telephoto and other things that I find gimmick because I'm not a camera phone user.  Overall: (8.25) It's a great phone for both everyday users and decent to heavy gamers. I might score it higher in the future if they successfully optimise the Operating system in the future updates and push it to 9 even with a decent camera because this phone has a lot of potential and considering it's future update promises of 4+6 for Android and security patch, it's a very good purchase. Just praying that these phones don't face any green line issues in the future.",POSITIVE

"The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G offers an attractive package, especially for users seeking solid performance at a budget-friendly price. Here’s a closer look at its key aspects:  Design and Display:  The Aqua Flow variant looks sleek with its gradient finish, adding a touch of elegance. The phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, making it easy for one-handed use. Its 6.58-inch Full HD+ display is sharp and vibrant, offering good color reproduction and brightness for media consumption. Though not AMOLED, the display performs well in outdoor lighting conditions and provides smooth scrolling with a 120Hz refresh rate.  Performance:  Powered by the Dimensity 6300 5G chipset, this device ensures a snappy and fluid user experience. It handles multitasking well, although the 4GB RAM might struggle slightly with heavier apps and games when compared to 6GB or 8GB variants. For regular usage like social media, video streaming, and casual gaming, the phone performs admirably. The inclusion of 5G support is a strong future-proofing move, especially at this price point.  Camera:  The 50MP Sony AI Camera setup is one of the phone’s strongest features. It takes good-quality pictures in daylight with sharp details and vivid colors. However, low-light performance could be better, as images tend to get noisy in dim environments. The AI optimizations, such as scene recognition, enhance the photography experience, making it easy to capture decent shots with minimal effort. The front camera is decent for selfies and video calls, though not exceptional.  Battery and Charging:  The phone packs a 5000mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day of moderate use. The charger in the box is a nice touch, offering fast charging support that gets the phone charged in under two hours. Battery optimization is good, ensuring you won’t run out of juice during regular day-to-day tasks.  Storage and Software:  With 128GB of storage, there’s ample room for apps, media, and files, and the phone supports microSD expansion if needed. The software experience is clean and customizable with iQOO’s Funtouch OS, which runs smoothly on Android. The UI is user-friendly, though there are some pre-installed apps that may not be necessary, but they can be uninstalled.  Verdict:  The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G is a competitive mid-range smartphone with solid performance, 5G support, a reliable camera, and good battery life. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly 5G phone with a stylish design, it’s a solid pick, but the 4",POSITIVE
"I am reviewing this after fully used and drop, ip test with pros and cons. If you want a phone with great performance, decent Camara also with latest Android 14 under 12k this phone will be perfect.. Best things are it's comes with Android 14 with funtouch os (if you are previously Vivo user you will got this) which is a great experience for me as 1st time user. On these segment its comes with 50 mp Sony IMX sensor 😘 with popular modes like slomo, which is really appreciated for budget lovers.. It's also supported 2k resolution with no lag..🤩 You will get 6gb ram with auto booster and 128 gb variant under 12k, it's a massive storage on budget..🤗 Ip64 with dust resistant, I have compared with other phones on this budget they have ip54 with no dust resistant feature..😄 This are the main points that I liked much, also I liked the wifi 5, fingerprint it's really fast with no animation, less bloat apps, ultra game mode etc..😉 Let's see the cons that I've got..😑🥴 Charging watt should be better at least 20 watts with inbox charger, 10 watt charger comes with it but the phone is supported 25 watt fast charging.. but 5000mah is good for long lasting uses.. charging time 5-80% was 1.15 hrs with inbox charger. Display should be comes with at least type IPS, it's comes with LCD display and decent colour gamut and 90hz gives most of all other phones on these budget. 1080p display will be much appreciated.. Design is good but if you have seen the poco c61 design that is comes with new radial cam design, so it's a disappointed because that's a under 7k phone..😆 Animation uses cause phone slower than usual..bso I will suggest not to use that..  Overall seen, decent Camera and Design, great performance (I will suggest to buy 6gb variant) with 5g variant, full day battery backup (for less gamers), IP64 with dust resistant 😍, latest Android 14 with 2 years of major upgrades and 3 years of security updates, handy weight with silicon cover on box.. Overall good on these budget segment with trust of VIVO.. 🫶",NEGATIVE

"Now it has been more than 2 months since I purchase and I have no complain about it. And I think it the best phone I ever purchased at this price range it provides almost all the features like camera, light gaming, a big battery which go through all the day , and many other features and functions. It functions smooth all the task without any hang problems. In one one it is a all-rounder phone . You can go for it without any hesitation. And it better than any other phone at this range.",POSITIVE
"First impressions: 1. While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding. 2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings. 3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them. 4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run. 5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge. 6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say. 7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant. 8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.  Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.  Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.  Update after 2+ weeks of usage: 1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive. 2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges. 3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.",NEGATIVE
"Bought this for office sim as a secondary mobile with op12 as primary.I generally use this mobile for office calls and little youtube and browsing here and there.

No hanging, no heating, not heavy and super fast finger print reader. Display quality is okish",POSITIVE

Sometimes some functions don't work. Don't expect much from this phone. My earlier phone Samsung F23 was much better than this. Regret selling F23 for this phone..",NEGATIVE
Best mobile at affordable price must buy. Working smooth. Bgmi game is lag free. The screen size and weight is good to hold. With nice colour accuracy. Your gaming experience increases. Must buy product for you and your loved ones.,POSITIVE
"Good Battery backup, body quality average. Speed good, camera average",POSITIVE
"Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.  Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.  Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.  If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.  I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.  They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.  Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.  For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: - Great battery backup. With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone. - Camera quality at this price is way above average. - Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point. - One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations. - No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer. - Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.  Cons: - Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g. - Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated. - Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage. - There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates. - Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector. So, need to shell out extra money for these.",NEGATIVE
"Good budget phone. If you are looking for a decent phone from a trusted brand go for it . Good built quality, decent camera , clean UI . Also for people looking for a secondary android phone can go for this one .  Cons : No charger , no back cover comes with the box  Just to highlight : I am not a gamer and use mainly social media and streams apps . If you are gamer please go for a different device.",POSITIVE
"Literally best product for those who avoid chinese products like me.

"Good design, battery backup, customised UI, display, performance.  Camera is just okay.  Device weight is heavy. Which is complicate to handle.",NEGATIVE
The mobile is coming with a factory loaded login pin. This prevented me from loading Apps and start working. I have to visit a Samsung Authorised Service Center to remove the login pin. This has casued a lot of mental agony and inconvenience.,NEGATIVE
"The Samsung Galaxy M35 is a solid all-rounder, offering best-in-class display quality and reliable performance in the budget segment. Whether you’re a casual user or a basic gamer(not for pro), this phone has you covered. If you're looking for a device that punches above its weight without breaking the bank, the Galaxy M35 should be at the top of your list in budget.  Stunning Display Quality Best performance Great battery life",POSITIVE
It is pretty fast and great for the price.,POSITIVE
"Confusion? After my review all your doubts will be clear as I was also confused before purchased.  Mostly feature works only on jio Bharat recharge of or above ₹123 . ( By Other recharge will not usable anything)  1. Jio Pay UPI Works i. Multiple Bank account supports ii. History & Balance check option iii. QR code ( generate & Scan) + Voice enable ( after update)  2. All Jio SIM works & without SIM you can buy but it supports only on Jio Bharat Recharge ( not Jio phone recharge)  3. After update, you'll get "" Games, Photos app , Jio Chat , Jio TV & Cinema etc""  4. Display size & Quality is not for watching any content available, You can listen only as it's screen pixel is too low.  5. Battery : Charging time is okay . & 1000 mAh is good & lasts 3-4 days easily on nominal usages.  6. Keypad: It's a good part of phone .  7. Design: light weight 70-80 gm is so light & good looking ( better than jio Bharat)  8. Torch : Big LED but less brighter ( however it's good in this price)  9. Vibration available  10. Ringtone available & customisable ( from local storage)  11. Wallpaper is available & photo can be as wallpaper  12. Browser : Bad experience as Opera Mini isn't suitable for this phone, screen size not good.  13. USB type Charging  14. 3.5 mm jack  15. FM radio available  16. Earpiece + loudspeaker ( both available) i. Earpiece: sound quality & loudness is enough ii. Loudspeaker is okay & quality is okay.  17. I tried all apps are working including "" UPI , TV , Chat etc""  18. SMS & Jio chats are separated , 300 SMS only.  19. Camera : photo & video available , but no use , it's bad quality if we compare with Jio phone it's worst. But what we can get in ₹699 😂  20. Alarm , Calcultor , Sound recoder , call recording etc are available  21. Navigation ( 4 - direction) key are customisable , can set to many things like Calcultor,Jio pay etc.  22. Menu + ok button are different , ok = entertainment ( Jio apps including jio pay)  23. Net issue is bit ( special in home) compare to my Poco phone but at the same place iPhone 14 has also issue ( bit less but yes have signal issue) . It's not big concern until you are facing signal issues in your home.  24. Free SIM delivery: I've to call to received person's contact number. I had already a SIM so didn't call.  25. I feel happy with this device design and quality. Paisa wasul ( as other network is charging ₹199 / month)  Hope I've resolved your all queries. Thanks me , I'm Roshan.",NEGATIVE
"It had complaints in simcard port, now it is not working as this phone is not getting charged  I think that damaged or manufactured rejects which has failed quality test of Jio Bharat Karbonn is been sold through Amazon app.  I tried to get this phone replaced from Jio but they didn't...stating that if I had purchased directly from Jio, they would have replaced...  Otherwise not possible...  So, I lost my money...",NEGATIVE
"So the first impressions are really good for the price at which this mobile comes. Only down side is he screen size as it's a bit difficult for my mom due to eye problems. But the phone is perfect whether it's the design, functions, charging, camera, price*",POSITIVE
Accha phone hai under 699 rupees but display quality utni acchi ni hai pixel clear ni hai aur call aane par speaker ke wajah se pura phone vibrate karta hai . Loudspeaker rakho ya earpiece same hi speaker work karta hai aur charge par lagao to kabhi 50% kabhi 70% maybe defective product tha baaki phone accha h light weight hai price ke according 1 baar charge karne par 1 din chal jayegi atleast basic phone hai internet chalane ke liye data on off ka koi option ni h bs app open karte hi data on ho jata hai. Call recording ka option hai jo ki manually on karna padta hai aur conference ka v option hai. Maine jab order kiya tha to sim ke bare me kuch ni bola gaya tha but delivered hone ke baad messages aa rhe the ki new jio sim lelo. Silky phone hai to girne ke chances hai. Nice phone but display acchi ni h to grandparents ko use karne me muskil ho sakti hai.,NEGATIVE
"It's a very nice experience with Phone in which everything works well in it , even UPI works by scanning QR code and you can use IT as a 2nd phone very good battery backup and nice even calling experience is very good",POSITIVE
"I had a karbonn phone (KX1i) from which I upgraded to this ""karboonn"" phone. And the experience has been horrible. I did not expect this from the Karbonn people. 1) No way to import old contact list/telephone numbers! I am doing this manually. A big headache. Similarly you cannot export your contact list to a new phone when you discard/upgrade from this phone! 2) No way to export SMS to laptop/other devices 3) No way to block a SMS sender 3) The UI is demented to say the least. (a) No way to reorganize/remove/hide unwanted items from the home screen. I need 3 clicks to access SMS!! (b) No way to easily add a completely dark/black or no wallpaper. There should be a built in black/no wallpaper option! Saves battery power and increases visibility. (c) No easy way to set classical ringtones and other sounds. Those should be a built in option.  I understand you have to follow Jio design BUT give us the option to customize! And import our old contact list! I bought this phone expecting some of the key features of my older Karbonn phone. I, also, understand that this a cheap phone but that does not mean you shortchange your customers on basic features/capabilities?  I regret buying this phone. Unfortunately this was the only official phone sanctioned by Jio. ---- And, you Jio Guys! Not everyone wants to watch a bloody movie/TV on 1 1/2 inch display!! What are you thinking!?",NEGATIVE
"I bought this just as an experiment. but unfortunately I am disappointed. extremely low quality. even basic feature like turn on /off mobile data is missing, that means mobile data will be on all the time and it will eat into battery. will use this as music player that's all.",NEGATIVE
So lightweight. battery life is good .better sound quality. with dynamic island .Charging speed fast.,POSITIVE
"Design One of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.  Display The iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.  Performance The iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.  Camera The iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.  Battery life The iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge. Overall The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.  Pros New design with rounded edges More powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 pro New 48-megapixel main camera Brighter display with upto 2000 nits brightness USB C can be used for anything Dynamic Island  Cons No 120hz display No Macro photography",POSITIVE
Good and improved device with latest features sound quality is awesome,POSITIVE
Good Quality and future but some options disadvantage in android it's available but iOS not available 😑,NEGATIVE
"Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of use  Pros - Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants - Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here - Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless - Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA - Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome - Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me. - The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone - Apples approach on Security! - Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless  Cons - The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm - I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases  Industry memes - USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much - Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!! - Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one? - 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting  Tips of managing battery health - Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh - Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up - I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging - Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20% - Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service - Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section - I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc - My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending above  Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.  ….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience",POSITIVE
It’s an amazing product iphone 15 bought for my son his very first iPhone he is loving it ..super phone,POSITIVE
Earlier I was sceptical about the product but as I received it was brand new and in perfect condition. Everything about the phone is amazing and camera and sound is top notch ❤️,POSITIVE
"This purchase seemed a sensible upgrade but it’s surprising and disappointing that it’s found to overheat while charging. I’m using Apple chargers, always have. This is not expected from an iPhone. Found this is a common concern from the Net, too late now.",NEGATIVE
"The phone is smooth there are no major bugs in the software however the ui could be more responsive, battery life is greatttt, I had no issues with performance, it didn't include the wide angle camera which could be a major thing to some people but the main camera takes very good photos which was not expected by me , screen is great, however I felt that the auto brightness features works a little late it would take time to adjust accordingly, one more thing it does not have a physical proximity sensor but till today since using it for 2 months I haven't face any issues during calls, if you are looking for a great performance, great battery and great screen phone this is the one for you.",POSITIVE

"Amazing smartphone! It has almost all the features what a smartphone user needed. I will not mention the prose only mention the cons for future buyers.. 1. Though Battery capacity is larger but the backup is not that good. 2. display brightness is not that good, ok ok. 3. Some heating are there, but not high. So its manageable. 4.

Valuable for money.. fast charging.. without curve is better option.. something curve option can't been click..,NEGATIVE
Using this phone from last 7 days. Look wise this phone is great and handy also. Back camera takes some boosted pics(Specially Green color) which some people may like. Selfie camera applies some beatification on images. Sound is clear and loud but bass is missing. UI is smooth but it filled with more bloat wares but thank god no Hot apps and Hot games. Network and Connectivity is well and good as of now. Battery is good but not great as compared to 5500 MAH battery. Charging speed is more than enough for me. You can expect the battery will last 1 day if you are a average user. It should have a memory card slot as it is a budget phone. The phone doesn't have any heating issue.,POSITIVE
"The OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G is a popular mid-range smartphone that balances affordability with some great features. Here’s a look at its unique pros and cons: Pros: 1. Affordable 5G Access: One of the more affordable options for experiencing 5G on a OnePlus device, offering high-speed connectivity without a high price tag. 2. High-Refresh-Rate Display: Its 6.72-inch LCD display with a 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling, gaming, and general use feel smoother compared to standard 60Hz screens. 3. Good Battery Life: Comes with a 5,000mAh battery that can last a full day with typical use, along with 67W fast charging, which can get the phone to around 80% in just about 30 minutes. 4. Solid Primary Camera: The 108MP primary sensor performs well in good lighting, capturing clear and detailed images, which is impressive for this price range. 5. OnePlus Software: OxygenOS, OnePlus's custom skin, is known for being clean, smooth, and less cluttered compared to some other Android skins.  Cons: 1. LCD Screen Instead of OLED: Unlike some competitors, it has an LCD instead of an OLED display, so colors aren’t as vibrant, and blacks are not as deep. 2. Limited Processor: The Snapdragon 695 chip is decent but not very powerful. It may feel a bit sluggish with more intensive tasks or high-end gaming. 3. Average Low-Light Photography: The camera’s low-light performance isn’t great, which may lead to noisy or blurry photos in dim settings.",POSITIVE
"I am writting this review after using the phone for more than a year. My satisfaction level is quite high for this phone. The built of mobile is so good. Look wise it is quite trendy. Performance is excellent. Quality of camera is very good. It comes with a super chager. Charging time of the mobile is very less. Back up is nice. After all it's a crafted mobile. It's worth every penny you spent . I have only small issues regarding the sound quality. When connected to bluetooth the sound is very low even at maximum volume. I specifically want to mention about it's water resistance quality. 'Marvellous' is what I would like to mention about it's resistivity towards ingress of water. My mobile fell down in water and remained under water for nearly 6 hours. When recovered, I was surprised to see the mobile still working nicely. All parameters were fine. Only SIMs were out of order due to water ingress in the SIM slot. I dried it up with a air blower, inserted the SIM and they started working fine. There was no water ingress to any other parts of the mobile. The net connectivity was working fine. This was a pleasant surprise to me. I have decided to buy only One plus for any future purchase. I highly recommend this.  Thank you One Plus.",POSITIVE
"After using the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G for a while, I’m quite impressed with what it offers at its price point. The 6.72-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate makes the screen incredibly smooth, especially while scrolling and playing games. The colors are vivid, and watching videos or browsing feels quite immersive.  The performance is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset, which has been decent for everyday tasks like browsing, using social media, and light gaming. Multitasking is seamless thanks to the 8GB RAM, and the phone handles most apps without lag. However, for more intense gaming or heavy usage, it can show some limitations compared to higher-end models.  One of the highlights for me is the 108MP main camera. It captures photos with impressive detail, especially in well-lit conditions. The colors are sharp, and it’s great for casual photography. Low-light performance, though, could be better, as the images sometimes appear grainy. The 16MP front camera works well for selfies, delivering clear and bright images.  Battery life is another strong point. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts me a full day with moderate use, and the 67W SUPERVOOC fast charging is incredibly quick—I can get from 0 to 80% in around 30 minutes, which is a lifesaver when I’m in a hurry.  In terms of design, the phone feels sturdy but lightweight, and the matte finish on the back is sleek without being too slippery. The only downside for me is that the phone lacks certain flagship features like water resistance or wireless charging, but at this price, it’s understandable.  Overall, I’d say the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G offers solid performance, a vibrant display, and excellent battery life for everyday users. It’s a great value for the price if you're looking for a mid-range 5G phone with reliable features.",POSITIVE

"I was facing issues with network, disturbance in calling & internet speed in my poco X6 5G smartphone since day one! I was literally feeling harassed with these problems during past six months. A 5G phone with a 5G sim, a 5G plan & mobile tower hardly a 50 meters away from my location, It was like a useless decision to buy poco X6! Battery also drained fast due to buffering & searching the network. Swiped the sims with another 5G phones also to get the accurate solution which got positively correct. The ringtone volume also goes zero automatically & I was not able to hear the ringtone only to see several missed calls! Hence I decided to go for Moto edge 50 fusion.. BELIEVE ME friends, all my problems & complaints got solved. Writing this review after 60 days of experience. Also, Moto's build quality is excellent, 144Hz curved glass display, vegan leather back finish, weight, minimal blotware, user friendly interface, camera with Sony lenses, future sequrity updates makes this phone- the best flagship brand in this segment. One more thing I want to mention here is that, the phone & its charging accessories have a soothing fragrance which gives you a fresh feel. Vegan leather back finish is just awesome. It gives you a non slippery handling no matter its in your hand or on the dashboard of your car. I didn't find any lags during past two months of use with the snapdragon processor. Speed, accuracy and functionality is great if compared with poco X6, redmi, vivo or any other similar samsung galaxy phones. Totally peace of mind purchase I must say. Thanks Motorola for such a beautiful experience & thanks Amazon for the best deal.👍",POSITIVE
"I purchased a Motorola Edge 50 Fusion from Amazon just 5 months ago, and after a software update in December, it stopped charging. This phone is still under warranty, yet Motorola's after-sales service has been a nightmare. There's no way to speak to a real person, and the Jaipur service center diagnosed a motherboard issue, quoting an exorbitant ₹20,000 for repair – an absurd amount for a warranty claim. They simply returned the broken phone. My emails explaining this get only automated replies telling me to go to the service center, which is useless. I'm left with a bricked, warranty-covered phone and zero support. Do not buy this phone. Phone is good but it's risky to purchase if unfortunately you have problem there is no solution",NEGATIVE
I have purchased Motorola edge 50 fusion few days ago and I am completely satisfied with its performance and user friendly software. Especially the software is very smooth and it operates without any glitch. Full day lasting battery life supports fast charging with remarkable sound quality. Overall performance is very good. I will suggest the best technology product available in the market at affordable price.,POSITIVE

"Quality is average, performance wise not good 12gb ram should work very fast. When I open multiple apps , apps are getting closed automatically when I try to reopen it , it is starting from the beginning. I guess apps are getting killed. Performance is not good.

"Bought this phone for a neighbour. He is 90+ in age. He was using his old nokia feature phone for more than 8 years. Now the battery efficiency has deteriorated and the handset itself had a few cracks, lost a button aswell as the prints on the keys. He asked me to get a new phone but refused a smartphone, wanted a button wala feature phone only, of a good quality and nokia brand only. Got him this one. I have posted a video of the device along with this review with a measuring scale so you get a general idea of the phone's dimensions. Build quality is good, sound quality is good. Uncle ji is very happy with this purchase.",NEGATIVE

"The green is horrible. Wish it came with a black case included. The hello moto ring tone is frightening. Otherwise it setup and copied data from my old samsung without a problem.  The fast charger does not seem to do superfast charging? Lost some whatsapp messages because I did not do a backu right before switching .. the moto process did not account for this .. asking for too much?  Battery is wonderful. Signal is alright. The ""Do no disturb on flip over"" maybe a nice feature but should not be on by default. Camera is decent. Other gestures are fun. Awaiting a 5-g sim. Hopefully connectivity will be great after that. Excellent phone for the price. Hope security updates will be delivered for a few years.",POSITIVE
Camera Good Display Awesome battery Good User Experience Satisfied. Its worth product. I recomend it.,POSITIVE
This is a pathetic phone. Pathetic service from Amazon. Hotspot is not working. And I am forced to work full time trying to connect with the amazon or product support. No one is answering. Truly pathetic. Seller doesn't have a spare to replace it which would have been much easier.,NEGATIVE
"The Moto G45 is a solid mid-range smartphone that offers a wide range of features, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious users. It stands out for its smart gestures, which are incredibly intuitive and make everyday tasks more convenient. Whether it's the chop gesture for turning on the flashlight or a twist for launching the camera, these small touches add a lot of value.  The **sound quality**, however, is average. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, it's not exceptional in terms of clarity or depth. If you're an audiophile or enjoy immersive audio experiences, this may fall a bit short of your expectations.  As for the **camera**, it's adequate for most situations, but there is a noticeable lack of sharpness in the photos. I was hoping for crisper image quality, especially in outdoor or well-lit environments. That said, it's still a capable camera for everyday use, just not the best if you're looking for professional-grade shots.  Overall, the Moto G45 is a feature-rich phone with some compromises, but it remains a solid contender in its price range. Will recommend for this price range",POSITIVE

"Mobile got heat when you connect it for charging and when you do some multiple work at same time and battery backup is not much good. Charging speed is good.

"Offers entry into the mid range segment at a good price. Got the 256gb variant for 27k during offers. The battery seemed week at the beginning but after a couple days and a few setting changes, it has improved now. 5g is also working fine. Camera is actually bad for this price point. Hoping for some improvements with software updates in future. The disadvantages are hybrid sim slot and the processor. Didn't really understand the single star reviews here...",NEGATIVE
"What I like: * Look and feel * Decent camera * Fast enough for my light use * Okayish battery. Lasts 1.5+ days for my light use  What I hate: * Within few months had issue with GPS navigation. Had to factory reset the phone to make it go away * Random back button press effect. Initially I thought was issue with screen guard. Changed those 3 times and now without a screen guard. Still issues persist, making phone almost unusable.  Frustrated to see a company like Samsung lowering the quality bar. No wonder why this phone didn't sell much",NEGATIVE

"The Nokia 105 Classic is a straightforward mobile phone designed for basic communication needs. It features a small color display, physical keypad, dual SIM support, FM radio, and a flashlight. Its focus is on simplicity and reliability.  The standout feature of the Nokia 105 Classic is its exceptional battery life, lasting several weeks on standby. It's easy to use, making it suitable for all age groups. The FM radio adds a nice entertainment option, and the phone's sturdy build quality inspires confidence.  Due to its basic nature, the Nokia 105 Classic lacks internet connectivity and has a limited camera. The small screen size can be challenging for reading text or viewing images. It's not ideal for tasks like web browsing or multimedia.  Considering its low price, the Nokia 105 Classic offers excellent value for money. It's a reliable device for calls and texts, making it a practical choice for those who don't need advanced features.  The Nokia 105 Classic has a simple and compact design with a tactile keypad. It's lightweight and comfortable to hold, with a durable construction that feels solid.  - The phone's dual SIM support allows users to manage two phone numbers simultaneously, which is convenient for those who need separate numbers for work and personal use. - The inclusion of a flashlight is handy for emergencies or when additional light is needed in dark environments.  In conclusion, the Nokia 105 Classic is a basic mobile phone that excels in providing essential communication features. It's a reliable and affordable option for those who prefer a simple device for calls and texts. While it lacks the features of smartphones, its long battery life and ease of use make it a practical choice for many users.",POSITIVE

"Its a great phone and exceeds my expectations in terms of usability and features. I needed a non-smart phone for two numbers.

"Design One of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.  Display The iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.  Performance The iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.  Camera The iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.  Battery life The iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge. Overall The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.  Pros New design with rounded edges More powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 pro New 48-megapixel main camera Brighter display with upto 2000 nits brightness USB C can be used for anything Dynamic Island  Cons No 120hz display No Macro photography",POSITIVE

Good Quality and future but some options disadvantage in android it's available but iOS not available 😑,NEGATIVE
"Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of use  Pros - Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants - Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here - Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless - Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA - Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome - Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me. - The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone - Apples approach on Security! - Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless  Cons - The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm - I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases  Industry memes - USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much - Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!! - Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one? - 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting  Tips of managing battery health - Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh - Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up - I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging - Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20% - Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service - Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section - I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc - My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending above  Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.  ….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience",POSITIVE
It’s an amazing product iphone 15 bought for my son his very first iPhone he is loving it ..super phone,POSITIVE
Earlier I was sceptical about the product but as I received it was brand new and in perfect condition. Everything about the phone is amazing and camera and sound is top notch ❤️,POSITIVE
"This purchase seemed a sensible upgrade but it’s surprising and disappointing that it’s found to overheat while charging. I’m using Apple chargers, always have. This is not expected from an iPhone. Found this is a common concern from the Net, too late now.",NEGATIVE
Surprisingly good product for the price. I have generally purchased the flagship phones of OnePlus with the assumption that they are better than the Nord-series. I now stand corrected. The NORD CE range is definitely an economical range and not meant for heavy usage but the Nord series are more than capable of taking on heavy usage. The camera is not great but at the price point it is more than adequate. The phone is well built and looks good. The finger print reader is quick and efficient. Phone functionality being almost bare bones androrid is high on user friendliness. A definite buy!,POSITIVE
"Bought the phone a month ago. Safe to say at this price range, for me, it's banger. A fast and smooth software experience and tough and durable hardware.  The oxygen os 15 update made the software smoother and brought some cool features as well. Battery gives an excellent backup, charges quick, the display is great and flat. Also the metal design is unique.  The only downside, or might i say, a slight disappointment is the camera. Not that good at this price. Still and over-all great one. Not even noticeable to the average user. Apart from that, One plus nailed it.",POSITIVE
"This is my first OnePlus device, before this iam user of poco believe me oxygen OS is far better than miui/ Hyper os. It's lag free,and very smoothly work, battery is al great, camera is not upto mark but ok. Performance is next level iam loving with it😎",POSITIVE
"I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4. It is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. I bought this phone during Great Indian festival after so much research and doubts. I was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. I was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. I don't want to compromise in any one thing. So after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. But in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. Curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. Now i feel it was the best decision. Best features of this Nord 4 are- Design - I literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. I thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. It cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all. Performance - It has the best performance and able to play BGMI so smoothly. Flat screen helps so much in games also. Battery - If you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins. Camera - I felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. If camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, Samsung or Iphone which are camera centric. But then other areas you have to compromise. Trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos. Network - Being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. Never felt any Issues at all. Display - It has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.  This review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for Oneplus Nord 4 for sure. Greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....  (If any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)",POSITIVE
"I've never had a OnePlus device before so I'll be totally unbiased over my experience for this phone since I bought it by the time of of first day launch🤗  1) Design: (9.5/10 Subjective) I love it but t's subjective is you prefer a glass built over a metal or the dual tone colours/texture appeals you less or more, but ultimately it's one of the most eye catching designs launched this year apart from the Nothing phones that has managed to attain a premium appearance in a very simple unibody structure.  2) Performance: (8.5/10) This is what makes it one of the top competitors within the 30k lineup phones. I personally play a lot of gatcha games like Genshin, Honkai and Wuthering Waves, over fps shooting so I would definitely say that gatcha games being heavier in graphics, Nord 4 is capable to provide the most efficient gaming. Practically speaking if you avoid those YouTube reviews with AnTuTu, any android phone would at some point face fps drop if you play in the highest settings and I do believe with what I've heard that even with high end processors like Snapdragon 7+ 3, OnePlus always limits it's potential which is why we do get to see some throttling, but on a long term it doesn't matter. If you are a daily user with 2-3 hours of heavy gaming per day or more with breaks after every 45 minutes to 1 hour of heavy graphic gameplay, then you could definitely have a great experience. If you are just a normal user, you can choose it blindly.  3) Built and UI: (9/10 for strength and quality but 7/10 for being expensive to replace) Ofcourse being metal you would expect a little bit of weight (around 200 grams) but you get used to it and it really feels much premium to feel that metallic weight in your hand. It might get really slippery and if it falls down it might not have scratches except for the glass portion around the camera but might face dents on the metal if the fall is too harsh, so I would suggest to have a back cover, and let's be honest no matter how premium the phone is even if it looks great, they are all at the end of the day sensitive and how you manage to care for it depends totally on you. Be responsible. And as I mentioned, it's going to be really expensive to replace a unibody metal frame if it's cracked or dented even if it's strong enough to work so be careful. As for the UI I've been a Xiaomi user so honestly I don't feel much different in terms of operating system with bloatware, but I really don't feel bothered by it as long as I'm able to disable it. I uninstalled and disabled not almost but EVERY single bloatware in this phone that I possibly could have including app market and even the gaming tool so now I don't get those security checks after installing apps and it feels as clean as any Flagship phone.  3) Battery: (8/10) It's good. Definitely better battery life than my iPhone BUT for how big the battery is, the Oxygen OS hasn't optimised it's battery life to it's maximum just as I mentioned before for its Processor but it's not a big deal. 5500mAH is something we see less as the price goes higher over handheld devices because they try to add more space for gimmicks like wireless charging which in my opinion is not very practical everytime unless you carry a wireless charger everywhere and they are really slow. But the wired charging in OnePlus with the 100 watt out of the box charger is great and it charges the device to full within 30 minutes tho I would suggest to toggle the option from Battery Health settings to charge it till 80 percentage so you can keep it's battery health stable for long. I hope they optimise it in the future updates but honestly it gives you around 7-8 hours of life with regular usage and even more if you are a light user which is more than enough considering that at some point you will need to charge your device any way.  4) Display: (8/10) It's a very smooth 120hz amoled panel with HDR support in Netflix that I never really use because I watch on my MacBook or the television (it's just better to watch anything on a bigger display over a phone to keep your visions safe) and an unnamed protection (Panda glass according to few sources) but I'll be practical over how much it actually matters. Being someone who has changed the displays in the past after getting it broken, it doesn't matter what Gorilla glass they put on your phone, it's a glass at the end of the day and if you are not being responsible enough by handling your phone with care, it's expected for your screen to face damage. Use a good tempered glass around 3-4 USD (200-400 INR) I won't suggest to go higher because no matter how expensive it is, even if it's able to handle a bend test, practically any tempered display is penetrable if it falls flat on a rough surface UNLESS you have a good thick back cover. Overall it's a good display but I feel that the brightness could be a bit bother outside if you live in a heavily bright environment. Personally I didn't face any issues for the time being as the peak brightness is really good in the sunlight but if you compare it to some cheaper devices, it might feel a little less.  5) Heating Stabilization: (9/10) I mean, it's metal? Ofcourse it's going to be hot DURING a gameplay but HEATING DOESN'T MEAN PERFORMANCE DROP. Also it's during the time when you are playing or doing some heavy task but the best part of metal is that it cools down as fast as it heats up and the cooling chamber in this phone is really efficient. Overall It's definitely better in terms of heat stabilization than any glass/plastic built phones for being a metal although I would say that, if you are travelling in a constantly hot temperature, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight for too long as it might get hot or else again, Use a back cover. BUT I'd also suggest to not use a back cover when doing some heavy gaming because it makes you loose the purpose of having a metal phone with such a good heating stabilization as plastic makes it harder to escape the heat.  6) Camera: (7/10 Subjective) This isn't my place but I would still give some opinion. It is decent and when I say that, it is actually not bad at all infact really good along it's limitations. It has a very natural tone on the back camera with a really good potrait mode and a decent front camera definitely better than a 25k phone but ofcourse with the specifications you see, there are limitations if you compare it to other phones in the same price. It's definitely better than Nothing 2a in terms of color and stability but not as close to camera centred phones like Vivo/Realme in the midrange but then again those phones lack either performance or the brand value, as OnePlus is much premium as a brand than Vivo/Realme even if they are from the same company. Again it is subjective and this phone in my opinion is rather a balance of performance along with the things you need in a midrange close-to-flagship phone rather than being an entire camera phone, but it's still really good even with the limitations of telephoto and other things that I find gimmick because I'm not a camera phone user.  Overall: (8.25) It's a great phone for both everyday users and decent to heavy gamers. I might score it higher in the future if they successfully optimise the Operating system in the future updates and push it to 9 even with a decent camera because this phone has a lot of potential and considering it's future update promises of 4+6 for Android and security patch, it's a very good purchase. Just praying that these phones don't face any green line issues in the future.",POSITIVE
"With CC discount, got it for a great bargain price. could not ask for more. Elegant, premium look. Wonderful camera, UI is also good. using it since 10 days, yet to explore many features.

"I'm extremely disappointed with my experience using the [ Nokia 235 ]. Despite its classic design and simplicity, the phone has been a letdown in terms of performance and reliability.  The battery life is short, requiring frequent recharging. And charging takes a lot of time The phone's durability is also questionable, as the plastic body feels flimsy and prone to scratches .  The lack of basic features like decent web browser makes it feel like a phone from the stone age. The customer support has been unhelpful .  Overall, I regret purchasing this phone and would not recommend it to anyone. Save your money and look elsewhere for a reliable and efficient keypad mobile device.  Unresponsive keypad, poor display, short battery life, poor call quality, flimsy build, lack of basic features, unhelpful customer support.",NEGATIVE
"It's an alright phone for the price ( which for me was ₹3499/-) it has UPI and decent resolution display. I could use it with a single hand, the calls are clear and crisp. All basics of a phone are covered.  Pros: 1. UPI via 123Pay, does not require an internet connection 2. Call Quality, absolutely awesome here. 3. Form Factor, easy to hold and fits comfortably.  Cons: 1. Average Battery, could have more than 5.5kWh 2. Single Speaker, also the earpiece, could have had 2. 3. Mocor S30+ OS, it is inferior to Nokia's now 20 year old S40v3 OS.",POSITIVE

"I always prefer this mobile due to its outstanding value for money. It's actually a alrounder phone . The look and feel is really good. It's light weight and the performance is top notch . Out standing previously I brought another phone and it was equipped with mediatek old 12 nm chipset I thought snapdragon is good and it's bad but this phone is come with 4 nm chip. Best power efficient and. Power delivery with the help of this chip. Display is super b . I switch to 120 htz it's butterfly smooth. Colour accuracy is good d it will support 4k vedio play back due to the efficiency of the chip. Camera is also so good . This is my secondary phone because i ready have an iPhone 13 but I changed my mind now this is my primary phone and using iPhone as my secondary. This is a honest review you can buy without any issues for sure. One more while playing pubg or other intense game the phone gets hot after sometime that too not so much a moderate hot. Charging speed is good. About ui it's really bad not so user friendly UI. better use Nova launcher which is I am using, be sure you are turning off advertisements and hide pre-installed some apps. Enough now enjoy the stock android experience 😀",POSITIVE

"Writing this review after 20 days usage. In my opinion  1. if anyone need to buy light weight mobile I will recomend to buy.  2. Best UI in recent time there is no lag when operating the mobile, opening an app like Hot star, Netflix app there is no lag and no delay on open a video.  3. Camera best quality in camera amazing front 16MP and back 50MP one of the best get live location scenery.  4. Battery Life - For only soft use without any Gaming guarantee upto 48 hrs charge life. Fast charging from 20% to 100% in just 45 to 50 mins.  5. Feel less when playing Games, I am playing PUBG games it took battery drainage slightly up. When playing 2 hrs 10 to 15% charge is going down.  6. Heating Issue - There is no heating issue when playing games. played 2 hrs not feel any heating problem. Recommended this for all heavy users. (Note - it's my views, it's upto you how many hours you are using)  7. Game Mode - Fantastic when On Ultra Game mode, you can control your battery life mode when playing games, as said above still battery might fell down as per my previous review.  8. Music is best like Vivo up and down speakers provide best quality. Using Boult ear buds gives you a different feel when hearing music.  9. Video - 1800x2400 video resolution gives best viewing experience when watching videos  10. Over all Review - One of best mobile satisfied with all performance till now. No external memory recommended to buy 256GB model.  Internal memory 8G+8G extended gives smooth performance. 14 Android OS still good to go.",POSITIVE
Phone quality is very good.picture quality is very good and sound quality is very nice.it is good for gaming.fast charging.all over very nice good to purchase.,POSITIVE
Pros  1. Phone look wise and feel wise very good and light weight 2. Display is good 3. Charging is good 4. Performance is good 5. Calling is good no drop till now 6. Sound quality good 7. Connectivity good  Cons  1. Worst RAM Management (If you open only 3 to 4 app the main Ram will be FULL) (when I purchased this phone 3 GB ram remaining out of 8 GB  2. Main problem is battery draining  According to my experience it will reduce 1 percent every 4 to 5 mint (but you have fast charger so you can charge it),POSITIVE
Surprisingly good product for the price. I have generally purchased the flagship phones of OnePlus with the assumption that they are better than the Nord-series. I now stand corrected. The NORD CE range is definitely an economical range and not meant for heavy usage but the Nord series are more than capable of taking on heavy usage. The camera is not great but at the price point it is more than adequate. The phone is well built and looks good. The finger print reader is quick and efficient. Phone functionality being almost bare bones androrid is high on user friendliness. A definite buy!,POSITIVE
"Bought the phone a month ago. Safe to say at this price range, for me, it's banger. A fast and smooth software experience and tough and durable hardware.  The oxygen os 15 update made the software smoother and brought some cool features as well. Battery gives an excellent backup, charges quick, the display is great and flat. Also the metal design is unique.  The only downside, or might i say, a slight disappointment is the camera. Not that good at this price. Still and over-all great one. Not even noticeable to the average user. Apart from that, One plus nailed it.",POSITIVE
"This is my first OnePlus device, before this iam user of poco believe me oxygen OS is far better than miui/ Hyper os. It's lag free,and very smoothly work, battery is al great, camera is not upto mark but ok. Performance is next level iam loving with it😎",POSITIVE
"I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4. It is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. I bought this phone during Great Indian festival after so much research and doubts. I was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. I was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. I don't want to compromise in any one thing. So after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. But in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. Curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. Now i feel it was the best decision. Best features of this Nord 4 are- Design - I literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. I thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. It cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all. Performance - It has the best performance and able to play BGMI so smoothly. Flat screen helps so much in games also. Battery - If you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins. Camera - I felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. If camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, Samsung or Iphone which are camera centric. But then other areas you have to compromise. Trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos. Network - Being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. Never felt any Issues at all. Display - It has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.  This review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for Oneplus Nord 4 for sure. Greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....  (If any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)",POSITIVE
"I've never had a OnePlus device before so I'll be totally unbiased over my experience for this phone since I bought it by the time of of first day launch🤗  1) Design: (9.5/10 Subjective) I love it but t's subjective is you prefer a glass built over a metal or the dual tone colours/texture appeals you less or more, but ultimately it's one of the most eye catching designs launched this year apart from the Nothing phones that has managed to attain a premium appearance in a very simple unibody structure.  2) Performance: (8.5/10) This is what makes it one of the top competitors within the 30k lineup phones. I personally play a lot of gatcha games like Genshin, Honkai and Wuthering Waves, over fps shooting so I would definitely say that gatcha games being heavier in graphics, Nord 4 is capable to provide the most efficient gaming. Practically speaking if you avoid those YouTube reviews with AnTuTu, any android phone would at some point face fps drop if you play in the highest settings and I do believe with what I've heard that even with high end processors like Snapdragon 7+ 3, OnePlus always limits it's potential which is why we do get to see some throttling, but on a long term it doesn't matter. If you are a daily user with 2-3 hours of heavy gaming per day or more with breaks after every 45 minutes to 1 hour of heavy graphic gameplay, then you could definitely have a great experience. If you are just a normal user, you can choose it blindly.  3) Built and UI: (9/10 for strength and quality but 7/10 for being expensive to replace) Ofcourse being metal you would expect a little bit of weight (around 200 grams) but you get used to it and it really feels much premium to feel that metallic weight in your hand. It might get really slippery and if it falls down it might not have scratches except for the glass portion around the camera but might face dents on the metal if the fall is too harsh, so I would suggest to have a back cover, and let's be honest no matter how premium the phone is even if it looks great, they are all at the end of the day sensitive and how you manage to care for it depends totally on you. Be responsible. And as I mentioned, it's going to be really expensive to replace a unibody metal frame if it's cracked or dented even if it's strong enough to work so be careful. As for the UI I've been a Xiaomi user so honestly I don't feel much different in terms of operating system with bloatware, but I really don't feel bothered by it as long as I'm able to disable it. I uninstalled and disabled not almost but EVERY single bloatware in this phone that I possibly could have including app market and even the gaming tool so now I don't get those security checks after installing apps and it feels as clean as any Flagship phone.  3) Battery: (8/10) It's good. Definitely better battery life than my iPhone BUT for how big the battery is, the Oxygen OS hasn't optimised it's battery life to it's maximum just as I mentioned before for its Processor but it's not a big deal. 5500mAH is something we see less as the price goes higher over handheld devices because they try to add more space for gimmicks like wireless charging which in my opinion is not very practical everytime unless you carry a wireless charger everywhere and they are really slow. But the wired charging in OnePlus with the 100 watt out of the box charger is great and it charges the device to full within 30 minutes tho I would suggest to toggle the option from Battery Health settings to charge it till 80 percentage so you can keep it's battery health stable for long. I hope they optimise it in the future updates but honestly it gives you around 7-8 hours of life with regular usage and even more if you are a light user which is more than enough considering that at some point you will need to charge your device any way.  4) Display: (8/10) It's a very smooth 120hz amoled panel with HDR support in Netflix that I never really use because I watch on my MacBook or the television (it's just better to watch anything on a bigger display over a phone to keep your visions safe) and an unnamed protection (Panda glass according to few sources) but I'll be practical over how much it actually matters. Being someone who has changed the displays in the past after getting it broken, it doesn't matter what Gorilla glass they put on your phone, it's a glass at the end of the day and if you are not being responsible enough by handling your phone with care, it's expected for your screen to face damage. Use a good tempered glass around 3-4 USD (200-400 INR) I won't suggest to go higher because no matter how expensive it is, even if it's able to handle a bend test, practically any tempered display is penetrable if it falls flat on a rough surface UNLESS you have a good thick back cover. Overall it's a good display but I feel that the brightness could be a bit bother outside if you live in a heavily bright environment. Personally I didn't face any issues for the time being as the peak brightness is really good in the sunlight but if you compare it to some cheaper devices, it might feel a little less.  5) Heating Stabilization: (9/10) I mean, it's metal? Ofcourse it's going to be hot DURING a gameplay but HEATING DOESN'T MEAN PERFORMANCE DROP. Also it's during the time when you are playing or doing some heavy task but the best part of metal is that it cools down as fast as it heats up and the cooling chamber in this phone is really efficient. Overall It's definitely better in terms of heat stabilization than any glass/plastic built phones for being a metal although I would say that, if you are travelling in a constantly hot temperature, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight for too long as it might get hot or else again, Use a back cover. BUT I'd also suggest to not use a back cover when doing some heavy gaming because it makes you loose the purpose of having a metal phone with such a good heating stabilization as plastic makes it harder to escape the heat.  6) Camera: (7/10 Subjective) This isn't my place but I would still give some opinion. It is decent and when I say that, it is actually not bad at all infact really good along it's limitations. It has a very natural tone on the back camera with a really good potrait mode and a decent front camera definitely better than a 25k phone but ofcourse with the specifications you see, there are limitations if you compare it to other phones in the same price. It's definitely better than Nothing 2a in terms of color and stability but not as close to camera centred phones like Vivo/Realme in the midrange but then again those phones lack either performance or the brand value, as OnePlus is much premium as a brand than Vivo/Realme even if they are from the same company. Again it is subjective and this phone in my opinion is rather a balance of performance along with the things you need in a midrange close-to-flagship phone rather than being an entire camera phone, but it's still really good even with the limitations of telephoto and other things that I find gimmick because I'm not a camera phone user.  Overall: (8.25) It's a great phone for both everyday users and decent to heavy gamers. I might score it higher in the future if they successfully optimise the Operating system in the future updates and push it to 9 even with a decent camera because this phone has a lot of potential and considering it's future update promises of 4+6 for Android and security patch, it's a very good purchase. Just praying that these phones don't face any green line issues in the future.",POSITIVE
"With CC discount, got it for a great bargain price. could not ask for more. Elegant, premium look. Wonderful camera, UI is also good. using it since 10 days, yet to explore many features.

"I have been using the OnePlus 12R for a while, and I’m extremely impressed with its overall performance.Snapdragon chipset ensures a seamless and lag-free experience, whether I’m gaming or multitasking.  The battery life is outstanding, and the super-fast charging is a game-changer. The camera quality is impressive, capturing vibrant and detailed shots even in low light.  I also appreciate the sleek and premium design—it feels great in hand and looks stunning. The OxygenOS software is smooth, customizable, and free from unnecessary bloatware, enhancing the overall user experience.  For its price, the OnePlus 12R delivers excellent value. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and powerful smartphones.",POSITIVE
"Easily one of the best purchases that I have made and well worth its price. Pros: - SD 8 Gen 2 is fast and very power efficient. The performance is indistinguishable in day to day usage when compared to SD 8 Gen 3 on a OnePlus 12 with UFS 4.0. Even though the 12R has a UFS 3.1 storage, you are unlikely to notice any difference whatsoever without running benchmarks or checking the specifications. In real life day to day usage, I have not found any difference and I am a power user who uses a lot of applications and use the phone over 8 Hours a day.  - The vapour chamber handles the cooling very well which keeps the device at excellent temperature even when playing games for an extended duration. It almost never goes over 38c.  - The display has the same features as the OnePlus 12 (the resolution is relatively lower but it's not noticeable to the naked eye without magnification) and this is one of the best displays that you will come across. The HDR performance is also some of the best I have seen and it is a completely different experience. This can also be seen in the HDR shots taken with cameras. I'd suggest going to a OnePlus experience center and searching for 12K HDR videos on YouTube to get a better idea. Note that the 4,500 nits mentioned is only the HDR brightness at a small white portion of the display under sunlight. This is NOT the max brightness of the full display. But it is bright enough to use under direct sunlight.  - Battery life is very impressive with over 8 hours of SOT and the 100W included charger fully charges it in about 35 mins.  - Also love that the display can be used even when your hands are wet unlike most other smartphones  - The bezels are extremely slim and the chin is smaller than the one on the OnePlus 12. I do wish it was equal all around though.  Rather than cons, I'll just mention what it lacks. - Wireless charging - Telephoto camera  That's pretty much it. If you are looking for a smooth and reliable device with solid performance, battery life, fast charging, decent cameras and display experience, I would easily recommend this. Sure the cameras may not be as good as an iPhone 15 (81k) or a Pixel 8 (83k) but they also cost around 80% more than the OnePlus 12R.",POSITIVE

"Poco M6 Pro 5G (8GB/256GB) is an impressively cost effective phone using an Octacore 2.2 GHz Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 processor. Usage journey is summarised below for other users to optimise it for higher performance, battery efficiency & nil bloatware experience.  Its a clear equivalent of Redmi 12 5G except NFC. I saw many users write about it having ads and bloatware, issues with battery drain, etc. These issues can be resolved to a great extent as I did.  As soon as it was put on the network, it downloaded Xiaomi HyperOS1.0.1.0 UMWINXM, ANDROID 14. The update was 4.4GB, took some time but the OS is as smooth as MIUI 14/ Android 13. Battery drain can be simply reduced by using the Battery saver mode. Further, you require to fine tune on background apps and disable ads, remove recommendations to reduce irritation. Camera is decent. Processor performance is good, no lagging. However, the famous quickball has been removed. For those interested to still want it on the device, the apk has to be installed additionally. For me, I like that wonderful feature as it was a life saver in older Poco/ Redmi/ Mi phones when the Menu/ Home/ Back navigation panel failed. With Quickball, my Redmi 3s is still working perfectly since last 7.5+ years. So, I did load the quickball version 15.0.1.0.1 and being tested.  POCO phones are always the beta for 'go to market' followed by the equivalent redmi versions. I have been using POCO (F1, C3, M3) user for many years, are truely worth the money, good hardware. Many came with a 6000mAh battery but this one has 5000mAh battery. The charger is fast (22.5W) but I prefer to slow charge the battery at night with a 5V/ 0.7A or 1A charger to improve the battery life, reduce the risk of battery bulging. It also reduces the risk of load on charger circuit due to lower charging current and no heat-up (Li-ion does not like heat, hence slow charging is safest), so battery and peripheral components remains safe and long lasting. The box came with its own transparent back-cover but I preferred a thicker back cover. Has a single Loudspeaker, hence lower audio volume. But the Screen is bright, even 30% is good for normal use. The most important feature of Xiaomi is the backup and restore, making the new phone have the exact look of your old Xiaomi phone in less than 5 minutes, some apps may not get backed-up. Finally, Amazon delivery was on time. Its just 4 days of testing and as of know I am satisfied.  Update after a week of use- Though the download speed is good, the phone does not show 5G (JIO SIM) on its display (it shows 4G+). This is an important part to resolve, probably a patch may be necessary if at all this is a bug, since the service provider detects it as a 5G phone but the phone itself shows 4G+. Requesting Xiaomi to validate my finding and close this accordingly. When the same SIM is put in another phone (Samsung/ IPhone), it shows 5G clearly. So this is an issue to be resolved by XIAOMI to prove that it is genuinely a 5G phone. No heating issue noticed after a week of use now.  UPDATE 2: We can force the network setting to 5G through developer options as 'NR' in Set preferred network type. But the battery drains drastically, hence avoid that. So the phone is obviously 5G when network setting is forced. Obviously all may not want to touch developer mode, so best to leave it as 5G/LTE in normal network settings. If XIAOMI patches to augment the setting as NR only in addition to common settings, it can show up 5G on the display, but at the cost of high battery consumption.  UPDATE 3 (16 April 2024): The legendary Xiaomi Quickball (apk version 15.0.1.0.1) has been tested and found to be working satisfactorily. Post hardening of HyperOS, the phone is almost AD free. Google loaded its own 'Messages' apk which will take control of the inbuilt default 'Messaging' app I have kept the Messaging app as default for messages as I dont want to use messages app of google for privacy control. Battery being 5000mAH, is found to be lasting for 2 days with mobile data 'ON'. A 6000mAH battery would have been better as found on many earlier POCO phones. Quality of hardware is very good and performing. With the new HyperOS 1.0.2.0 loaded, 2 years of formal updates makes it a an economical phone with good features. Reminding all that ads-free performance can only be achieved after hardening through developer mode. I havent used memory boost function, I dont think I will require it with a 8GB (uses LPDDR5) memory. Only if needed, I will configure it. I have also installed a 128 GB memory card, which virtually reduces internal memory usage.  UPDATE 4 (18 April 2024): A bug is identified on HyperOS. When Wifi calling is ON and Wifi is connected with a stable network, outgoing calls cannot be made. Incoming calls also do not get through. I have tested this multiple times. Xiaomi has to immediately act and fix this bug. Upon putting WiFi calling OFF, the phone resumes normally. This problem did not exist on earlier MIUI used by me.  Except this new bug identified and therefore stopping Wifi calling (actually stopping wifi calling has improved the battery life, so I dont mind not having this feature as JIO network does not have issues in our area and around), POCO M6 Pro 5G is a decent value for money. Most positives, smaller negatives for a phone in 11-12k range. Surely, Xiaomi should action it with a patch immediately.  UPDATE 5.. Only for MIUI phone users, wont work for other phones (18 May 2024): When POCO M6 Pro is fully configured, take its backup using Additional Settings--> Backup and restore. A backup file is generated in MIUI folder under AllBackup--> Backups--> Filename with backup date. Simply copy that file and move it to your old Mi/ Redmi/ POCO phone (min. Android 10) in exacly the same folder. Then restore that file. While it will replicate the phone, you will get the benefit of the new look Control Centre. The old MIUI Control Centre will be replaced by the new HyperOS Control Centre with no change to Android Version or security patch. I liked this look and have retained the new HyperOS Control Center in my old POCO C3, which is a backup of the new phone (in case of exercising Disaster Recovery option). Its like the old Car in a new shell. Havent had any issue on that since last 15 days of using the HyperOS Control Centre in the old POCO C3. Others can enjoy too.  UPDATE 6.. For 6 GB/ 128 GB Version (31 July 2024): I have also bought the 6 GB/ 128 GB variant. Having hardened the HyperOS, this phone is almost a stock android like with nil bloatware. The usage time has increased since the memory utilisation has reduced and with it, the battery lasts slightly longer as compared to the 8 GB/ 256 GB variant. You would notice that Xiaomi has released the Poco M6 plus and Redmi 13 5g variant last month using the same processor by little overclocking (they call it accelarated or AE) to 2.3 GHz instead of 2.2 GHz, adding a 120 Hz display and 108 MP camera, etc with 35% higher price for 6GB/ 128GB. Well, I am contented with the M6Pro 5g's price to performance since frying the CPU may reduce its life.  Regards..... AD",POSITIVE
"My phone is running good ,camera is decent for the price , performance of the phone is decent nd nice , gaming is smooth . The only issue is heating , the phone heats very easily which sometimes effects my gaming but not so much , design is good , battery backup is good , people say the Charging is slow but I found it to be decent , the phone is big which is good for watching videos and playing games , there is a misconception of motherboard issues in poco but I think it was in poco xseries only because my frnd is using this phone for almost 2 yrs no motherboard or other issues also I am using the 6gb and 128 gb varient .

"I've been using the realme Narzo N61 (Marble Black, 4GB RAM+64GB Storage) for a few weeks, and while it shows promise, it falls short in some areas.  Pros:  1. 90Hz Eye Comfort display: Smooth visuals, reduced eye strain. 2. IP54 dust and water resistance: Added durability. 3. 48-month fluency promise: realme's commitment to software updates. 4. Charger included: Convenient. 5. Affordable price point.  Cons:  1. Performance issues: Device can be slow, especially with multitasking. 2. Occasional lag and freezing: Frustrating experience. 3. Display touch issues: Unresponsive or inaccurate touch registration. 4. Limited storage (64GB): May require frequent cleaning or expansion.  Key Features:  - 6.5"" HD+ display - MediaTek Helio G35 processor - 4GB RAM, 64GB storage (expandable up to 1TB) - 48MP primary camera, 2MP macro, 2MP depth sensor - 5000mAh battery - Android 12 (Realme UI 3.0)  Verdict:  The realme Narzo N61 has potential, but its performance and display issues hold it back. If you prioritize smooth performance and responsive touch, consider alternatives.  Recommendation:  Ideal for:  - Basic users (calling, texting, social media) - Casual gaming (non-demanding titles)  Not recommended for:  - Demanding gamers - Multitaskers - Those seeking seamless performance  Rating Breakdown:  - Display: 3.5/5 (touch issues) - Performance: 3.0/5 (slow, laggy) - Battery: 4.0/5 - Camera: 3.5/5 - Value: 4.5/5  Suggestions for realme:  1. Optimize software for better performance. 2. Improve display touch sensitivity. 3. Consider upgrading storage options.  Would I recommend this product? Only for basic users.

Best mobile in budget range,POSITIVE
Everything is great but has slow internet access like even in high speed wifi the phone can only access slow speeds with buffering internet and only useful for small tasks like social media cannot handle huge tasks like gaming. Screen size is gud. Sound quality could be better but it sounds ok with single speaker,POSITIVE
"It works well, battery backup is good stays for upto a day in normal usage, charging speed is also fast, little to no heating when used light, It is well and good for elderly people who need a phone for their usage, sound quality is fine.",POSITIVE

"I purchased Apple 16 128GB on 16/Jan/2025 started using it from 17/Jan battery is draining even though its idle, authorized service center also confirmed and they gave a service record letter (after lot of conversation the representative hardly agreed to upload the document he is really not suitable to continue in the position) i uploaded the report to amazon, when i choose for replacement Amazon says they need another letter from Authorized service center, as expected they Apple never gave any denied report to anyone, now i don't have option to either replace and cancel.  Amazon customer care is really not helpful, better don't buy any products from amazon website offers by attracted, they will send a defective /refurbished/re-used devices..  Amazon you loss the trust and belief of a valued customer who paid 80,000/- on a product  My sincere suggestion to those who want buy any apple product better visit the store and purchase from there.",NEGATIVE
Excellent product from Apple,POSITIVE
The best feature of iPhone is that it does not hang even after many years of use. This one is super fast and easy to use,POSITIVE
"Now it has been more than 2 months since I purchase and I have no complain about it. And I think it the best phone I ever purchased at this price range it provides almost all the features like camera, light gaming, a big battery which go through all the day , and many other features and functions. It functions smooth all the task without any hang problems. In one one it is a all-rounder phone . You can go for it without any hesitation. And it better than any other phone at this range.",POSITIVE
"First impressions: 1. While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding. 2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings. 3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them. 4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run. 5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge. 6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say. 7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant. 8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.  Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.  Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.  Update after 2+ weeks of usage: 1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive. 2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges. 3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.",NEGATIVE
"Bought this for office sim as a secondary mobile with op12 as primary.I generally use this mobile for office calls and little youtube and browsing here and there. With moderate usage it lasts two days easily.  Forgot that this phone has a camera and if your priority is a secondary phone which lasts longer with decent processor, go ahead and purchase.  No hanging, no heating, not heavy and super fast finger print reader. Display quality is okish",POSITIVE

"I had high hopes for the Nokia, expecting the legendary battery life Nokia was once known for. Unfortunately, this phone falls far from the mark. Not even lasts 10 months",NEGATIVE
"Very easy to use & lightweight dual sim Nokia Symbian phone. It takes 2 full size sim cards but u can also use adapters for micro & nano sims.  Voice/call clarity is great & ringtone is loud enough. Camera flash is a very bright torch. Looks lovely in the blue shade & it's compact enough. Good for senior citizens as it has big buttons & screen size is big for a Symbian phone too, so it's good value for money.  The Battery last quite long when it lies in idle. ONLY CONS are that the Camera is below average + phone doesn't have bluetooth connectivity..",POSITIVE
Phone is good but the Received calls audio is not clear.,NEGATIVE

"Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.  Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.  Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.  If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.  I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.  They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.  Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.  For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: - Great battery backup. With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone. - Camera quality at this price is way above average. - Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point. - One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations. - No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer. - Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.  Cons: - Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g. - Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated. - Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage. - There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates. - Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector. So, need to shell out extra money for these.",NEGATIVE
"Good budget phone. If you are looking for a decent phone from a trusted brand go for it . Good built quality, decent camera , clean UI . Also for people looking for a secondary android phone can go for this one .  Cons : No charger , no back cover comes with the box  Just to highlight : I am not a gamer and use mainly social media and streams apps . If you are gamer please go for a different device.",POSITIVE

"Good design, battery backup, customised UI, display, performance.  Camera is just okay.  Device weight is heavy. Which is complicate to handle.",NEGATIVE
The mobile is coming with a factory loaded login pin. This prevented me from loading Apps and start working. I have to visit a Samsung Authorised Service Center to remove the login pin. This has casued a lot of mental agony and inconvenience.,NEGATIVE
"The Samsung Galaxy M35 is a solid all-rounder, offering best-in-class display quality and reliable performance in the budget segment. Whether you’re a casual user or a basic gamer(not for pro), this phone has you covered. If you're looking for a device that punches above its weight without breaking the bank, the Galaxy M35 should be at the top of your list in budget.

"Display, functions, sound quality, battery life",POSITIVE
"Nice phone, moderate battery back-up, quality of camera is better than Redmi A3.",POSITIVE
"While the phone may be considered value for money, especially in the hands of older generation, I felt it's UI is too obsolete. The System Launcher is too primitive and it doesn't support any Widgets, and I had to install Infinix XOS Launcher. Surprisingly, even Poco Launcher 2.0 was not compatible with this Poco phone. Also, there are very few options in Settings, compared to that of Redmi phones (My mom had been using Redmi 7A all this while). The phone also seems slow, even after System Update, and the touch pad does not run as smooth as expected. System Apps like Contacts, Messages, Calendar and Dialer are also primitive. Camera is sub-standard.  Pros: 5000 mAh Battery Fast Charging Adapter. Gorilla Glass protection. Large Screen. Fingerprint Sensor.",NEGATIVE
Camera quality is good it's looks are quite impressive battery lasting longer than other phones that I possess. Overall I am happy to buy Tecno pop9. It is economical and is perfect for my needs.,POSITIVE

"Here are my genuine experience after using this phone since 2-3 days. # What's are good in this phone: >Battery is Ok Ok (it's 4G phone, obviously consumes less power). >Dual stereo speakers, sounds well during multimedia plays.  # What's are bad in this phone: >Software is not up to the mark. Not even for daily uses apps. Apps take reloading just only 2 min of inactivity. >Island punch hole is just for hike in the market. Not for any use. >Not given some useful functions like double tap to on/off. Given only some limited functions. >Camera platform is not looking good. >Over whole phone is very very laggy. You will literally irritated after just using 10 min of use.  Final review: If you have budget below 7k, there are a lot of options in the market in this price range. Don't trust on the YouTube's review.",NEGATIVE
One of the best product and best features in this range. Thank you Tecno !!,POSITIVE
Super mobile but charging was very slowly this device was charging very slowly otherwise totally good,NEGATIVE
"Under 6k it’s a very good phone. Decent camera ,display . Performance is very good under this budget.",POSITIVE
Great performance for the money paid. Good quality.,POSITIVE
It's good for the price but the camera is very poor and the display given should have been amoled instead of this ips lcd. Other than that everything is ok. Battery life on a single charge is lasting a full day. Speaker is single and the sound quality is average only. Brightness when outdoor is insufficient at times. 4 gb ram is not good option always go for higher ram.,NEGATIVE
"You can go for it; if you're not a heavy gamer! Does the job without any issues. You get samsung UI and some features are missing as those are available in A and S series of samsung other than that it works smooth, user friendly and camera quality is good and it doesn't support wide angle camera lens.",NEGATIVE
The RAM is not supporting the device..working very slow..hanging issue.. touch also not working sometimes.,NEGATIVE
Clear screen and long battery backup No lagging And have android 14,POSITIVE
But it’s says it’s unlocked for all carriers which is false. The phone has to be used with an Indian SIM card first.. also it doesn’t not come with a charger.,NEGATIVE
Performance is balanced but not for high level gaming . Display quality is good. Battery life is also good . Device is smooth if only you play normal apps and games. Overall mobile is perfect and also value for money 👌🏻.,POSITIVE
"Many people get confuse between Samsung M14 & M14 4g. Difference is that later gets snapdragon and former gets Exynos processor both work good. Pros- Snapdragon processor 665. Screen gets 393 PPI resolution, 6.7"" display, 90hertz refresh rate. Ram /Rom 4/64gb. 2 sim and dedicated memory card slot. C Type charging slot. C to C charging cable is provided with 25 watt fast charging capacity. Triple camera 50mp+ 2mp+2mp at back and 13mp camera for selfie , quality is good. Finger print sensor is given side mounted. Battyback is good provides 2 days backup. I don't play games. 2 gen of OS updates(when u start first updates takes place) and 4 years of security updates. Works smooth no lag Cons- Not for heavy gamers. Lite games only Adaptor is not given ,I suggest buy only Samsung adaptor 25Watt while purchasing mobile. Samsung please provide adaptor with mobile handset",POSITIVE

"Excellent mobile phone at affordable price. Configuration is very high. Battery is fabulous, charges phone in just 27 minutes from 2% to 100%. Rest all is good. Must buy product if you want to buy new one right now.",POSITIVE
"After using this phone for a month, I can say it's a great choice, especially for the price. The first thing I noticed was the weight—it feels surprisingly light despite housing a large 5500 mAh battery, which is impressive for long-lasting power without adding bulk. The phone is slim, comfortable to hold, and fits well in the hand, making it ideal for daily use.  The camera quality is good for standard photos but has limitations. While it handles basic shots decently, the wide-angle video quality falls short, and there’s no 60 fps option in 4K, which could be a drawback for those who love detailed video work. Additionally, I noticed the camera app tends to lag or even get stuck after taking multiple portrait-mode shots, which disrupts the experience a bit.  Overall, it's a solid budget option with good design, reasonable performance, and decent battery life, though the camera could use a few software improvements for smoother functionality.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus Nord CE 4 is arguably the best phone in the under-25k price range. It features a massive 5500mAh battery, and the 100W fast charging is a significant plus. The battery easily lasts 7-8 hours with regular use, including apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and YouTube. The speakers are loud and crisp, delivering an excellent audio experience. OxygenOS 15 is buttery smooth, adding to the overall premium feel of the device.  Overall, I absolutely love this phone!",POSITIVE
"Really like the build quality, Camera, Sound and performance. Somehow I am expecting much from picture quality but it is okay. As the performance is wonderful.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus Nord CE 4 in Celadon Marble is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a balance of style and performance at a reasonable price. The Celadon Marble color gives the phone a premium, unique look that stands out, and it feels great in hand with its sleek, lightweight design.  With 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the phone handles multitasking smoothly, even with multiple apps running. The performance is snappy and responsive, thanks to its optimized processor and OxygenOS, which offers a clean, intuitive user experience. The battery life is impressive, lasting through a full day of moderate use, and fast charging is a real convenience.  The camera quality is solid for this price range, delivering",POSITIVE
"I've been using this phone for about a week now and I feel that it's super awesome. Let's talk about the pros and cons : Pros 1. The display is pretty bright and amazing. It can play HDR videos upto 1440p in YouTube and you can set your device to brighten up while playing HDR videos in the setting. 2. The UI is very smooth. It has a lot of features too! 3. The cameras are awesome! They click such amazing photos and shoot amazing videos. It clicks natural photos. There are modes like timelapse,slow-mo,etc too. It has OIS, which only records at 1080p 60fps. There is a mode in the video section named 'ultra steady' by which you can use OIS. 4. The performance of the phone is amazing and is well optimised! 5. The built is quality is nice too! 6. The charging is fabulous! It has a 100 watt charger in the box which can full charge your phone in 25 minutes when smart rapid charging is on. The battery backup is just amazing. This phone gives a whopping 1.5-2 days of battery backup. 7. There is a feature that you might not know, you can adjust the intensity of brightness of the torch by pressing and holding the torch symbol, just like iphones. 8. The speakers are loud AF! After updating there is this mode where you could ultra boost volume upto 300% which is crazy! And it's very-very loud.  Cons 1. It can't play 2160p in HDR. 2. It doesn't support OIS on 4k 30fps and the OIS video has very slight unnoticeable jitterness. 3. The animation is kinda slow but smooth for me, so I changed it in developer options. 4. The frame and back is made up of plastic.  The phone is pretty awesome and the cons don't bother me 😄. I'm a tech enthusiast so you can trust on me!",POSITIVE

Front and back Camera is good, 4. lite weight compare to others smart phones 5.Ring tone and call speaker sound is excellent 6. finger print sensor is good 7. design super.",POSITIVE
Valuable for money.. fast charging.. without curve is better option.. something curve option can't been click..,NEGATIVE
Using this phone from last 7 days. Look wise this phone is great and handy also. Back camera takes some boosted pics(Specially Green color) which some people may like. Selfie camera applies some beatification on images. Sound is clear and loud but bass is missing. UI is smooth but it filled with more bloat wares but thank god no Hot apps and Hot games. Network and Connectivity is well and good as of now. Battery is good but not great as compared to 5500 MAH battery. Charging speed is more than enough for me. You can expect the battery will last 1 day if you are a average user. It should have a memory card slot as it is a budget phone. The phone doesn't have any heating issue.,POSITIVE
"This phone’s 5160mAh battery is a standout feature. It easily lasts through a day of heavy use, and with moderate use, it can stretch into the second day. No more anxiety about running out of power.",POSITIVE
Phone back panel looks so classy Real camera module looks superb Performance of phone is very good Screen works great even in sun light Everything works flawlessly,POSITIVE
Got it today and hated it for having dull color. Not sure what it is! Description tells that this phone will have superb clarity but that's not true. I had Vivo that had vivid colors. They got Narzo N55 that had brighter colors than Vivo but not sharp. And now this one doesn't have any of the good attributes. Rest I am yet to explore.,NEGATIVE
All good in this price segment overall camera also good nice battery backup performance also good.,POSITIVE
Look is very good,POSITIVE
Better display and also camera,POSITIVE
Good mobile,POSITIVE
"I had switched to the S23 Ultra from the iPhone 13. For me, the S23 Ultra is in a different league compared to the iPhone 13. The cameras are so much better and the telephoto lens of the phone also adds an interesting and useful component to the phone. even when gaming, it gives me 120 fps in most of the games. the display is fantastic and even the charging is adequately fast and reliable. (you need to buy the 45w charger separately.) apart from that, the speakers are fantastic and the haptic feedback is great too. The only major downside I found is that it heats a little bit while you play heavy games and the phone charges slowly while being used. overall, if you can get this phone below 85k now, definitely go for it as it almost has no difference compared to the S24 ultra. The battery backup is also great and 1.5 charging cycles lasts me the entire day. (my average SOT is 10-14 hours). The S pen is also quite handy and is useful occasionally. I would say this is the best all-rounder Android phone you can get if you're looking for a phone below the 100k barrier. Also, the phone will get updates till Android 17 so there is no worry of the OS falling back in time and will run you a good 3 years even if you buy the phone now. Remember that the phone is huge and only buy it if you're comfortable with this form factor or this phone may render as useless to you. go for the regular s23 models if you're not a hardcore user but if you have the budget and requiremnts of the features in this phone i would 100% recommend this phone to you.",POSITIVE
"I always wanted to experience a curved display flagship smartphone by Samsung, hence ignored the S24 Ultra and bought the S23 Ultra because it's the last curved display phone by Samsung.  First of all, I got the phone delivered within 5 hours of placing the order, so thanks to Amazon for superfast delivery  Now coming to the phone  Pros: 1) Performance is just excellent. No heating issues faced. SD 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy is greatly optimized by Samsung. 2) One UI is the best custom Android UI on the market 3) Cameras : no explanation needed. The portraits, the night shots, video recording capabilities are just excellent 4) Battery : lasts easily for 1.5 days with moderate usage with QHD resolution, will lasts even more with FHD+ resolution. 5) Display : excellent quality display, perfectly visible in bright sunlight. It's a joy to watch movies on this screen  Cons: 1) At least 25W charger should have been provided in the box 2) Though the charging speed might be a con for some people, I think it's good that Samsung doesn't provide ultra high speed charging on its phones, ensuring longer battery life.  Overall, just go for it. Even if you buy today you can use it till at least Dec 2028 without any updates issue.",POSITIVE
"powerhouse with its stunning 6.8-inch AMOLED display, smooth 120Hz refresh rate, and vibrant colors. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor ensures top-tier performance for gaming and multitasking. The 200MP camera captures incredible details, and low-light photography is excellent. Battery life is solid, lasting a full day even with heavy use. The S Pen integration is a great addition for productivity. While it's on the expensive side, the premium build, exceptional display, and top-notch camera make it one of the best flagship smartphones available.",POSITIVE
Phone look wise amazing Great camera quality both front and rear value for money Great Touch quality and smoothness AI feature is functionality fantastic  But as far as battery life is concerned draining very fast .....needs to charge twice or thrice a day without any heavy usage of phone  Rear Camera quality at 200 MP is worst Vivo v 40 is better compare to this,NEGATIVE
"Here's a glowing review for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.

Whether I'm gaming, multitasking, or simply browsing, the S23 Ultra delivers seamless and lag-free experiences.  *Camera: A Photography Powerhouse* The camera system on the S23 Ultra is nothing short of phenomenal. The 200MP primary sensor, paired with a 12MP front camera, produces stunning images with incredible detail and color accuracy. The camera app is intuitive, and features like Super Steady video stabilization and 8K video recording make it a joy to capture life's precious moments.  *Overall Package: A True Flagship Experience* The S23 Ultra's design is sleek and premium, with a sturdy glass back and IP67 water resistance.

Sealed and new 👌,POSITIVE
"Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.  Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.  Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.  If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.  I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.  They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.  Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.  For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: - Great battery backup. With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone. - Camera quality at this price is way above average. - Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point. - One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations. - No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer. - Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.  Cons: - Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g. - Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated. - Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage. - There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates. - Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector. So, need to shell out extra money for these.",NEGATIVE
"Good budget phone. If you are looking for a decent phone from a trusted brand go for it . Good built quality, decent camera , clean UI . Also for people looking for a secondary android phone can go for this one .  Cons : No charger , no back cover comes with the box  Just to highlight : I am not a gamer and use mainly social media and streams apps . If you are gamer please go for a different device.",POSITIVE
"Literally best product for those who avoid chinese products like me.  Display: SAmoled 120hz with victus+ protection Speaker sound: Dual loud with excellent bass quality Build: Solid build Software: One ui 7 (coming soon) Battery: 6000 Mah Camera: 50Mp OIS Os updates: 4 years Android updates Samsung customer service is top notch  This samsung M35 has satisfied my needs more than what i expected  My previous phone was Samsung M31, this M35 is significantly improved compared to M31  My suggestion: Buy extended warrenty, enable dolby atmos, use finelock to customize nextlevel  Thanks for your time",POSITIVE
"Good design, battery backup, customised UI, display, performance.  Camera is just okay.  Device weight is heavy. Which is complicate to handle.",NEGATIVE
The mobile is coming with a factory loaded login pin. This prevented me from loading Apps and start working. I have to visit a Samsung Authorised Service Center to remove the login pin. This has casued a lot of mental agony and inconvenience.,NEGATIVE
"The Samsung Galaxy M35 is a solid all-rounder, offering best-in-class display quality and reliable performance in the budget segment. Whether you’re a casual user or a basic gamer(not for pro), this phone has you covered. If you're looking for a device that punches above its weight without breaking the bank, the Galaxy M35 should be at the top of your list in budget.  Stunning Display Quality Best performance Great battery life",POSITIVE
It is pretty fast and great for the price.,POSITIVE
"I'm leaving a 5* here just because this phone is close to perfect for me. Do not expect wonders if you are planning to buy this phone. As the headline suggests, it is not for everyone.  1. The build quality is good and the weight feels perfect as it is not on the heavier side. Since the weight distribution is good, it's easy to handle with one hand despite the screen size being close to ""massive"".  2. The AMOLED screen works it's magic while watching videos. My primary aim to buy this phone was for viewing purpose since I spend a lot of time on YouTube and other streaming platforms. The color distribution is a chef's kiss since it does not try to forcibly add gradients. More on the natural side and hence the viewing experience will feel pleasant.  3. Sound could have been better. The mono speakers feels cheap but yet surprisingly does the job. I use speakers and headphones so that it's that big of an issue for me (but if you depend on phone speakers for your entertainment, better look for another phone possibly POCO for stereo speakers at the same price point but then you will miss out on the display part )  4. CHARGING ISSUE? The answer is NO, Although it's been just a day using this phone, i did not face any issues. I was skeptical after reading the reviews about the charging issues. It's true that I faced a little hiccup when i first charged the phone right after unboxing where the connection is interrupted during charger but that was just for a few seconds (Give it some time and the charging connection issue will disappear). Further the Hyper OS update completely rectified the issue.  5. Refresh rate at 120Hz noticeably improves the social media experience. Brightness is good and you won't have any issues using the phone in sunlight. Switch to optimal settings for better using experience  6. 5G works like a charm for me with JIO giving speeds of over 250 Mbps most of the time (Depends on the 5G zones. Some of you might get even better since stay near the outskirts of the city)  7. Gaming: Not yet tested but it doesn't matter a lot to me so that's fine.  8. Camera : Low light photos are good but make sure to stabilize your hand or else it would be blurry. 108 MP camera photos are good and provide good detailing. It could definitely have been a lot better but this phone is not for camera enthusiasts. If you like to create memories by clicking photos and not fuss about the details about them you can definitely go for it.  Overall do not exclude this phone from your options (if you are planning on buying this) just by reading the negative reviews. I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews. People should update their phones to the latest firmware to bring out the best and eliminate any bugs.",POSITIVE
Charging Backup is less.,NEGATIVE
"I am writing this review after 2 months of use. I'll try my best to explain my experience so that you can make better decision accordingly. 1. Camera: Nice when capturing steady pics, but average otherwise. Still it won't disappoint you if you click pictures with 108 MP mode. It gives that quality. 2. Speed: Great in terms of this. Runs smooth as butter with its 12 GB RAM. Also, it is one of the cheap smartphone where you'll get this much ram in such low price. 3. Looks: Amazing in terms of looks. This is one of the reason I bought this. Choose any color, its impressive. 4. Heating: Yes, you might observe some heating issues, but that won't bother you. Very less frequent. I got this issue only once in 2 months when I was driving on my 2 wheeler with this phone fixed on bike dashboard in order to navigate with maps. That time, It heated up and I got message to shut down some apps, clear RAM. I did that and onwards I didn't face this issue. 5. Battery: I put this point at last because if you are battery lover, then this phone will disappoint you. Fast charging and fast discharging! It will keep consuming battery even if you keep it aside.  Overall, it is a good phone to buy. Major issue I feel is the battery. If you are fine with this, you can buy this phone because they are providing lot of features in this price, especially the RAM.",NEGATIVE

"I purchased Apple 16 128GB on 16/Jan/2025 started using it from 17/Jan battery is draining even though its idle, authorized service center also confirmed and they gave a service record letter (after lot of conversation the representative hardly agreed to upload the document he is really not suitable to continue in the position) i uploaded the report to amazon, when i choose for replacement Amazon says they need another letter from Authorized service center, as expected they Apple never gave any denied report to anyone, now i don't have option to either replace and cancel.  Amazon customer care is really not helpful, better don't buy any products from amazon website offers by attracted, they will send a defective /refurbished/re-used devices..  Amazon you loss the trust and belief of a valued customer who paid 80,000/- on a product  My sincere suggestion to those who want buy any apple product better visit the store and purchase from there.",NEGATIVE

"OnePlus has outdone itself this time, delivering a smartphone that truly lives up to its legacy as a flagship killer. After using it for a week, here are my ratings:  1. Design: 10/10 The slim, boxy design with a matte black finish feels premium and elegant. The in-hand feel is exceptional.  2. AI: 10/10 Packed with all the latest AI features, it’s both innovative and intuitive.  3. OS: 9/10 The return of OxygenOS is a brilliant move! While there are a few bloatware apps, OxygenOS 15 is lightning-fast and smooth.  4. Camera: 9/10 While not flagship-level, the camera performs impressively, capturing excellent detail in most scenarios.  5. Battery: 10/10 The silicon battery is a game-changer, offering 10-11 hours of screen-on time with moderate use—simply outstanding.  6. Processor: 10/10 The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 delivers optimized, power-efficient performance that feels seamless.  7. Display: 10/10 The display is breathtaking—vivid, sharp, and a delight to use.  Overall, OnePlus 13R is a powerhouse and offers unbeatable value for its price.  Conclusion: The OnePlus 13R is a masterclass in balancing performance, design, and innovation at a competitive price. With its sleek design, cutting-edge AI features, impressive battery life, and smooth performance, it redefines what a flagship killer should be. While the camera isn't quite flagship-level, it holds its own in most scenarios. If you're looking for a phone that offers premium features without breaking the bank, the OnePlus 13R is the one to beat.",POSITIVE
"A powerhouse of performance and style! ✨ The stunning display is captivating, and the camera delivers crisp, vibrant photos. Gaming is smooth as butter, thanks to its blazing-fast processor. Battery life easily lasts all day, and charging is super quick. Definitely a top contender in its price range!",POSITIVE
"No phone can be rated 5 out of 5. At the best 4.5 would be possible with something or the other falling short.. Oneplus 13R has many great things under it's hood but half heartedly done to retain the difference between R and the non R phone.  A. Positives.  1. Display. Excellent and flat display. No concerns as it now comes with life time warranty for green line issues, if any and if at all which is a great peace of mind considering Oneplus would honour it. Supports Dolby vision, HDR +. The display is bright, clear and crisp. The under display optical finger print sensor is placed lower closer to the bottom bezel failing to the ergonomic placement. It could have been an inch above. However, no issues with it's operations. Quite quick but not as fast and quick as ultra sonic sensor. 2. Processor. Excellent. No lags and no hiccups. (I am not into gaming but i know this would fare well based on my experience with S24 Ultra. Note that there would be heating felt upon prolonged heavy app use. However, this SoC would serve well for several years with new android updates. Now with Oneplus offering 4 plus 6 years SW update policy this is future proof hardware. 3. Sound. Ok, the stereo sound is decent and loud enough but there's evident distortion over 90 percent volume setting. Bass isn't very evident. Also Dolby Atmos is now not available. Otherwise it's a proper stereo sounding speakers. 4. RAM, Storage and Communication. Excellent specs with DDR5 and UFS 4.0. With base version starting at 12GB/256GB it's more than enough for most users. It is however let down with USB 2.0 post that limits transfer speeds but then it's something that wouldn't bother to most people who wouldn't be transferring data to and fro from other devices. IP protection is IP65 which is fine but IP 68 is a common thing at these prices especially from chinese phone makers. Haptics are tight but weak. A little more stronger motor would have been perfect. 5. Battery. Excellent. Anything between 7 to 10 hours of SOT can easily be had from this phone. A proper full day battery unless you are into gaming all the day. I use 50 percent for my use case which involves social media, few camera photos and browsing with about 4 hours of SOT. Calling drains faster than multimedia watching which probably needs to be rectified with future updates. Some carrier bands seems to have been removed, however I didn't have any issues with calling or internet on my 4G airtel SIM. There's no wireless charging though. 6. Call quality Very good and clear. No issues at either end..signal reception is also good.  B. Negatives. 1. Software This is Color OS 15 which is slightly modified as Oxygen OS 15. It's super smooth and slick with lots of customizations possible. But still it's no where near Samsung One UI which is far superior, functional and feature rich than Oxygen OS 15. Also Oneplus added few bloatwares like Phone manager, Phone pick and few other apps. Luckily, you can either uninstall them or disable them. Interestingly, as an example the biggest overlooked setting is you can chose when to enter Power saving mode but you can come out of it only when you charge it till 90 percent. This is something that's silly and Oneplus must automatically disable power saving mode once the battery crosses it's trigger point. There are couple of such thoughtless things in Oxygen OS 15 which should be rectified. There's also nothing like Routines which Samsung offers on their S and A series for phone automation tasks. 2. Cameras Some changes are positive but half hearted. Something like adding a telephoto 2X instead of macro which is such a welcome move, but then this lens has no OIS. UW 8 MP is just passable in daylight. In day light both main and 2X give good quality photos however low light performance is much to be desired. 3X with OIS would be more practical as such. Video on this phone is even more compromised with 4K limited to main sensor. All other sensors are capped at 1080P. In the front 16 MP camera is again okish for photos and handicapped for videos capped at 1080, 30 FPS which is a bummer. Overall Oneplus could have done better with the cameras but it seems like they intentionally subdued R series more to differentiate it with the pricier Oneplus 13 rather than on pricing front. 3. AI There are few AI features in photos, notes etc..but frankly they don't work as seamlessly or effectively as what can be seen on my S24U from Samsung. Oneplus has a long way to go in this aspect. Right now it's more gimmicky.  My last Oneplus phone was 3T post which I switched to Samsung S series. No doubt S series, especially Ultra is leagues ahead both hardware and software but when it comes to value for money Oneplus 13 series does shine. Moreso with their introductory pricing and offers. Yes some of the above shortcomings could have been included at this price point, but stills it's a safe bet and a promising phone for years of use with the kind of hardware and SW you get from Oneplus. I would recommend the Oneplus 13R phone under 40K for its hardware and revised SW update policy.",NEGATIVE
"I can't post a photo because am posting the reivew from it. 😀😀 The phone delivers all things promised in those youtube reviews.  Couple of days of using it - super smooth, premium experience. And looks better in real life. The camera is exceptional, the phone is super smooth, screen and display is amazing. The battery gives me around 9 hours of screen time, note I am not a gamer but played cod for 2 hours to test the phone performance. It does not heat up even a degree. The battery charging is so good. No need to overnight charge your phones. The camera AI features are amazing, no lesser than pixel, if not better. Hope it follows the same as it grows old.",POSITIVE

"Battery is great, easily stands for one day with minimal gaming and normal usage. Camera is better than the so called flagships comparing its price range, videography is a little bit letdown.

Overall a better product for this price point.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus 13 epitomizes a paragon of contemporary smartphone engineering, amalgamating avant-garde technology with an aesthetic finesse that is both opulent and utilitarian. Encased in a chassis that exudes both durability and elegance, the device boasts a 6.82-inch LTPO AMOLED display, delivering a visual experience that is both immersive and resplendent.  At its core lies the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, a powerhouse that ensures seamless multitasking and an unparalleled user experience. This is complemented by a formidable 6,000 mAh silicon-carbon battery, which not only promises longevity but also supports 100W wired and 50W wireless charging, facilitating rapid replenishment of power reserves.  The photographic capabilities are nothing short of extraordinary, featuring a triad of 50 MP sensors co-engineered with Hasselblad. This ensemble includes a wide, periscope telephoto, and ultrawide lens, each meticulously calibrated to capture images with impeccable clarity and color accuracy.  In summation, the OnePlus 13 is a testament to the zenith of smartphone innovation, offering a harmonious blend of performance, design, and functionality that is poised to satiate even the most discerning of tech aficionados.",POSITIVE
"After receiving this phone and seeing review pictures of Vivo X200 and Oppo Find X8, I was worried about this phone seeing the Sun in them and Photos of Human being keeping the Sun behind but these pictures I posted gave me confidence that One Plus 13 5g is great for Photos. This is an Extraordinary Phone requiring no other phone for beautiful Photographs. No heating issues at all. Battery great. At night the battery is above 50% always. Charging is very fast. 1TB storage I bought at Rs. 89,999/- while Find X8 pro 512 gb is Rs. 99,999/- and Find X8 512gb is 79,999/- while Vivo X 200 pro 512gb is 94,999/- and Vivo X200 is 71,999. I have seen pictures of iPhone also but this Phone One Plus 13 5g is a class in itself. This phone does not have Samsung Screen which is itself a plus and One Plus assured screen replacement.

"Design One of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.  Display The iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.  Performance The iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.  Camera The iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.  Battery life The iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14.

"Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of use  Pros - Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants - Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here - Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless - Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA - Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome - Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me. - The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone - Apples approach on Security! - Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless  Cons - The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm - I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases  Industry memes - USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much - Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!! - Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one? - 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting  Tips of managing battery health - Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh - Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up - I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging - Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20% - Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service - Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section - I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc - My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending above  Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

"I can't post a photo because am posting the reivew from it. 😀😀 The phone delivers all things promised in those youtube reviews.  Couple of days of using it - super smooth, premium experience. And looks better in real life. The camera is exceptional, the phone is super smooth, screen and display is amazing. The battery gives me around 9 hours of screen time, note I am not a gamer but played cod for 2 hours to test the phone performance. It does not heat up even a degree. The battery charging is so good. No need to overnight charge your phones. The camera AI features are amazing, no lesser than pixel, if not better. Hope it follows the same as it grows old.",POSITIVE
"***** A True Flagship Experience! *****  I recently got my hands on the OnePlus 13, and I must say, this phone is a game-changer. OnePlus has truly outdone itself this time. Here's why:  Design & Build The sleek design is stunning and feels premium in hand. The finish on the back resists fingerprints, and the phone is surprisingly lightweight yet solid. It's definitely a head-turner!  Display The AMOLED display is gorgeous, with vibrant colors and buttery-smooth 120Hz refresh rate. Watching videos and gaming feels incredibly immersive, even under bright sunlight.  Performance Powered by the latest Snapdragon chipset, the phone is a beast! Multitasking is seamless, and gaming performance is top-notch with zero lags. Apps open in an instant, and the overall performance feels lightning-fast.  Software The OxygenOS experience is clean and intuitive. The new customizations and smooth animations make the Ulleven more enjoyable.

Rugged and tough 10. Overall feel  Cons 1. Bulky charger 2. Slight Heating issues in prolonged usage and multitasking 3. Slow wireless charging 4. Inferior back cover (case),POSITIVE
"The display is not much curved is better, function smooth, battery power good and charging is fast. Arctic down (White colour) is best among all three colour.",POSITIVE
"Battery is great, easily stands for one day with minimal gaming and normal usage. Camera is better than the so called flagships comparing its price range, videography is a little bit letdown. Oxygen OS 15 is awesome with some great animations and customizations. Performance has no lag or issues. So far havent faced any heating issues. Overall a better product for this price point.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus 13 epitomizes a paragon of contemporary smartphone engineering, amalgamating avant-garde technology with an aesthetic finesse that is both opulent and utilitarian. Encased in a chassis that exudes both durability and elegance, the device boasts a 6.82-inch LTPO AMOLED display, delivering a visual experience that is both immersive and resplendent.  At its core lies the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, a powerhouse that ensures seamless multitasking and an unparalleled user experience. This is complemented by a formidable 6,000 mAh silicon-carbon battery, which not only promises longevity but also supports 100W wired and 50W wireless charging, facilitating rapid replenishment of power reserves.  The photographic capabilities are nothing short of extraordinary, featuring a triad of 50 MP sensors co-engineered with Hasselblad. This ensemble includes a wide, periscope telephoto, and ultrawide lens, each meticulously calibrated to capture images with impeccable clarity and color accuracy.  In summation, the OnePlus 13 is a testament to the zenith of smartphone innovation, offering a harmonious blend of performance, design, and functionality that is poised to satiate even the most discerning of tech aficionados.",POSITIVE
"After receiving this phone and seeing review pictures of Vivo X200 and Oppo Find X8, I was worried about this phone seeing the Sun in them and Photos of Human being keeping the Sun behind but these pictures I posted gave me confidence that One Plus 13 5g is great for Photos. This is an Extraordinary Phone requiring no other phone for beautiful Photographs. No heating issues at all. Battery great. At night the battery is above 50% always. Charging is very fast. 1TB storage I bought at Rs. 89,999/- while Find X8 pro 512 gb is Rs. 99,999/- and Find X8 512gb is 79,999/- while Vivo X 200 pro 512gb is 94,999/- and Vivo X200 is 71,999. I have seen pictures of iPhone also but this Phone One Plus 13 5g is a class in itself. This phone does not have Samsung Screen which is itself a plus and One Plus assured screen replacement. This is a great phone and it has great OS. Haptics, LTPO 2K screen. It's fluid. It's a flagship phone.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus Nord CE4 Lite 5G emerges as a compelling mid-range smartphone that offers excellent value for budget-conscious consumers.

It may not be revolutionary, but it delivers solid value for everyday use.",POSITIVE
My review : Performance [ 4/5 ] - Gaming Performance good but you'll see some frame drops and lag somewhere while using but a great gaming experience at this price. Camera [ 3/5 ] - Very limit features in camera app and quality is also not good and you'll find better options in market at 20k. Battery [ 5/5 ] - Awesome battery life and 80w fast charging is crazy and will take about 40m-60m for 0-100%. Display [ 4.5/5 ] - Good display quality in this price segment. Software [ 4/5 ] - Somewhere a decent ui experience but if you are looking for a good ui then Samsung ofc will be the best option. Conclusion - If you are looking for a phone for normal use and don't use camera that much then it's a great choice but OnePlus as a company is not offering you something special if you buy at by seeing their brand value and it's quite similar to Realme Mobiles.,NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:  Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.  Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.  Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.  Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.  Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.  Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.  In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.",POSITIVE
Camera quality: very good Charging speed: very fast Fingerprint reader: very quicky Weight: light weight Heating issue: didn't tried gaming so not sure about high level performance but for normal use it is not heating at all,NEGATIVE
"I purchased it for my sister, she is not a heavy user. She uses it for pictures, social media and youtube mostly. So She is happy with this mobile. It looks sleek, and colour also matches India’s current political situation 😊. Camera is satisfactory. Battery is long lasting which is nice to have. 5g woks excellent. So overall it’s a nice phone. I got it on discount so keep an eye out",POSITIVE
Pros: Good battery backup Decent camara in well light condition Cons: Poor processer and performance Worest photos in low light condition Faced lack in finer print sensor Finally not worthy under 20k segment Best option is Poco x7 comparing with this.,NEGATIVE
"OnePlus are the very best manufacturers of mobile devices, bar none.",POSITIVE
Don't go for this device..am wonder about that in product's it's clearly mentioned that only for sale and warranty in India..then why this seller selling in uae ?🤬waste of time,NEGATIVE
"Phone looks good, but no phone cover or charger like seen in some reviews",NEGATIVE
"You need to make sure whay you're getting this for. It has the best screen for the price, a big one at that, looks and feels good, with decent battery life. It doesn't have a very good camera but it's fine. Bloatware is there but ofc you can delete it and that's understandable at the price range. Do not get this for gaming. It's not made for that. I don't believe phones are supposed to be amyway, thus it is perfect at what it does",POSITIVE
"This phone is best in its segment and most demanding variants also are very good in colour. I'm very happy and satisfied with this product as it has some pros and cons like battery draining is high but charging speed also very fast camera is with fully high resolution. 5G connectivity it has, looks good while using comparatively best in size and it has premium looks but processor could have been more better but who those don't play games this is the best choice for them. Runs very smooth as it is 8+8 GB Ram",POSITIVE
1) display is very nice 2) battery is good and since it charge quickly so charge is not all a problem 3) its network carrying capacity is very good. I tried in regions where other phones had no network but my phone was getting good network. 4) it's camera is not really very bad. it's good enough for normal use and it has stabilization facility.. so recording video and taking pic with shaking hand is not a problem.it can still take good picture. 5) it's compass is nicely calibrated. so u will get accurate position while using Google map 6) if u play free fire game the aim automatically get pulled to the enemy.. hahah so it gives u extra power while playing the game. 7) it does have a single speaker yet it's loud.. and with Dolby Atmos it sounds really nice .,POSITIVE
"A decent phone suitable for those with typical daily driver use. Nothing is phenomenal yet nothing can be said as bad for the price it retails. Camera is good, performance is acceptable, looks are good. The only thing i didn't like about it is the bundled opaque silicon case that completely hides the phones actual color. Overall a good Phone!",POSITIVE

Very good item. Arrived quickly..my mother is very happy with it! Good quality for a reasonable price!,POSITIVE
"If you are in a budget and need a samsung phone then this is the phone for you. My initial choice was to buy some other phone but had to buy it from amazon cause they deliver products to my address in short time for specific products,as after delivery of the product in stepulated time I had some other travel plans and no other websites/app were delivering that quickly (depends if other websites or app delivers to your address in time and give you good deals on products then book yours product from them) coming to the product  What I liked  Usefull compact screen as I don't like too much big screens Amoled screen Battery backup Compact phone Decent camera without out too much colour boosting, natural images both front and back camera I'm not a gaming person so whatever multitasking and media consumption I had to do,the processer handled it smoothly can't say about the same performance after 2,3 years as company claimed to give four years of OS upgrades Calling quality, bluetooth functions,wifi all seems to working fine with my unit till this review writting  What I didn't like  it feels old fashioned because of notch in era of punch hole displays even in 6000 rupees phones,it has amoled screen but after comparing it with other phones which have full HD IPS displays with about 600 nits of brightness the screen brightness, direct sunlight visibility or the overall multimedia experience is almost the same compared to IPS displays phone of mine which I felt like there's not much of a difference so I think the amoled screen helps only conserving battery in long run  Charging speed is slow and you have to buy compatible 25watt charger separately which I feel is also slow coming from using variety of phones which I have with 30 watt charging which is the least I have been using and that 30 watt charging brick came along inside the phone box  Phone is bit heavy but no complain cause we know there's 6000mah battery, it maybe a deal breaker for some but I'm ok with it  Company mentioned it has Dolby Atmos support but after using the phone it feels like gimmick, sounds the same as any other under 15000 rupees phone  It has hybrid sim slot which I didn't liked as I use a SD card and 2 sim card at a time but don't know why all the companies abandoned giving dedicated sim slots under 15000 rupees phones so there's no choice for users(there are some old model phones with dedicated sim slots available online but they are nearing their end of service life)so had to buy this product what choice was there under the circumstances  No back cover was included in the box as 99% of other phone companies are provided them in this price range  Will give you update in coming months if somethings happen regarding the phone",NEGATIVE
Is real good and the battery was awesome need to charge only wants and it work all day amazing phone.,POSITIVE
"The phone weight is a little bit too much almost 215gms, which is too much. The camera is good and the battery is okay. The backside of the phone is anti fingerprint so it’s good. The durability of the phone is quite nice in this price range. And the screen is amoled display and has 90 hertz, if it is 120 hertz it can be better.  Overall if u are looking for a Samsung phone in this range u can go for it.",POSITIVE
"After use of 3 weeks, I have following comments on important aspects of the phone: 1. Display - a big disappointment. Does not feel anything like Super AMOLED. The brightness is okay for indoors, but pathetic outdoors. My earlier phone with 480-nits LCD was brighter. 2. Battery - Great. Lasts more than 2 days (but I don't play heavy games). 3. Calls and Sound - Very good. The single speaker delivers crisp audio and call volume. 4. Cameras: Below average. Daylight pics on main cam are okay. Indoor pics are very soft and grainy. Wide angle and Macro are of no practical use. Front cam is just okay for selfies and video calls. 5. Processor and speed - Good for day-to-day normal usage. You don't expect much from Dimensity 6100+. It is okay for moderate usage. Smoothness is average. 6. Software - Tons of bloatware. It is a tedious task to uninstall / disable them and still you get lots of notifications. 7. The phone tends to heat up during long calls, so better to use earbuds.  This is not what I expected from a Super AMOLED phone from Samsung.",NEGATIVE
"This phone covers everything in reasonable price- looks, screen quality, camera, space processor etc. Got this phone for my parents and it is very easy for them to use, they really liked the screen clarity and camera. Very good phone in 11k price. Highly recommend for parents and first time smart phone users.",POSITIVE
"Charging speed good, connectivity good ,phone functions good ,sound quality good, battery life good, thank you",POSITIVE
Using the mobile is almost 10 days now. The best thing about the mobile is battery life. It's runnes almost 1 and half day after the full charge for normal users like me (I don' play games so can't tell gaming experience). Cameras is also pretty good compering it's price range. Mobile is little bit heavier (Obviously 6000 mah battery). The biggest con is Samsung is not providing 25w charger which you have to buy from market. Which will cost again 1k nearly. But overal the experience is satisfying.,POSITIVE
"The phone is smooth there are no major bugs in the software however the ui could be more responsive, battery life is greatttt, I had no issues with performance, it didn't include the wide angle camera which could be a major thing to some people but the main camera takes very good photos which was not expected by me , screen is great, however I felt that the auto brightness features works a little late it would take time to adjust accordingly, one more thing it does not have a physical proximity sensor but till today since using it for 2 months I haven't face any issues during calls, if you are looking for a great performance, great battery and great screen phone this is the one for you.",POSITIVE
"1. Look wise premium as curved AMOLED 120 Hz display and curved back pannel provided. 5/5 2. Camera decent rating 4/5 3. Battery 5500 mah lasting 1.5 day for heavy users and charged 💯 % in 50 minutes. 5/5 4. Performance - App opening fast, games run smoothly and not heating. Should be better if given UFS 3.1 storage. 4.5/5 5. Weight Light, handy to use as well gripped in one hand. 6. Network quality Very good either in low network areas 5/5 7. Price should be less by 1 or 1.5 k, that will definitely make it a value for money phone. 8. Sound quality nice 👍 Loud enough to hear clearly in even noisy places. 9. No heating in using or charging. 9. Using it from 15 days and no issue with performance.",POSITIVE

"A great mid ranger. One of the devices withbest battery backup, thanks to its 4nm processor and Fun OS optimisation. Camera is also good, touch, feel, look everything good. Touch is very responsive. Don't hesitate to buy if your budget is less than 20k.",POSITIVE
"Amazing smartphone! It has almost all the features what a smartphone user needed. I will not mention the prose only mention the cons for future buyers.. 1. Though Battery capacity is larger but the backup is not that good. 2. display brightness is not that good, ok ok. 3. Some heating are there, but not high. So its manageable. 4. Front Camera is average, I expect it should be good as the back camera, but unfortunately not. Personal Rating - 7.8/10",NEGATIVE
"Amazing smartphone It has almost all the features what a smartphone user needed. 1.Battery capacity is 5500 mah but the backup is not that good. 1.5 day used fully discharged and 5G Used fast drained , 44 wats charger 100% in one hour 2. Amoled Display super and brightness is good, 3. Front and back Camera is good, 4. lite weight compare to others smart phones 5.Ring tone and call speaker sound is excellent 6. finger print sensor is good 7. design super.",POSITIVE
Valuable for money.. fast charging.. without curve is better option.. something curve option can't been click..,NEGATIVE
Using this phone from last 7 days. Look wise this phone is great and handy also. Back camera takes some boosted pics(Specially Green color) which some people may like. Selfie camera applies some beatification on images. Sound is clear and loud but bass is missing. UI is smooth but it filled with more bloat wares but thank god no Hot apps and Hot games. Network and Connectivity is well and good as of now. Battery is good but not great as compared to 5500 MAH battery. Charging speed is more than enough for me. You can expect the battery will last 1 day if you are a average user. It should have a memory card slot as it is a budget phone. The phone doesn't have any heating issue.,POSITIVE

My review : Performance [ 4/5 ] - Gaming Performance good but you'll see some frame drops and lag somewhere while using but a great gaming experience at this price. Camera [ 3/5 ] - Very limit features in camera app and quality is also not good and you'll find better options in market at 20k. Battery [ 5/5 ] - Awesome battery life and 80w fast charging is crazy and will take about 40m-60m for 0-100%. Display [ 4.5/5 ] - Good display quality in this price segment. Software [ 4/5 ] - Somewhere a decent ui experience but if you are looking for a good ui then Samsung ofc will be the best option. Conclusion - If you are looking for a phone for normal use and don't use camera that much then it's a great choice but OnePlus as a company is not offering you something special if you buy at by seeing their brand value and it's quite similar to Realme Mobiles.,NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:  Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.  Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.  Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.  Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.  Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.  Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.  In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.",POSITIVE
Camera quality: very good Charging speed: very fast Fingerprint reader: very quicky Weight: light weight Heating issue: didn't tried gaming so not sure about high level performance but for normal use it is not heating at all,NEGATIVE
"I purchased it for my sister, she is not a heavy user. She uses it for pictures, social media and youtube mostly. So She is happy with this mobile. It looks sleek, and colour also matches India’s current political situation 😊. Camera is satisfactory. Battery is long lasting which is nice to have. 5g woks excellent. So overall it’s a nice phone. I got it on discount so keep an eye out",POSITIVE
Pros: Good battery backup Decent camara in well light condition Cons: Poor processer and performance Worest photos in low light condition Faced lack in finer print sensor Finally not worthy under 20k segment Best option is Poco x7 comparing with this.,NEGATIVE
"OnePlus are the very best manufacturers of mobile devices, bar none.",POSITIVE
Don't go for this device..am wonder about that in product's it's clearly mentioned that only for sale and warranty in India..then why this seller selling in uae ?🤬waste of time,NEGATIVE
"Phone looks good, but no phone cover or charger like seen in some reviews",NEGATIVE
Mobile is very nice and good product Safe delivered Very good Good delivery Fingerprint is very Feel good Storage good Excellent battery Nice display touch,POSITIVE
"This is a good budget mobile phone but it does not have any special specifications. Its camera is okay, its battery backup is good and sometimes it hangs, I don't know why because it has 6 GB RAM but still it hangs. Apart from this, security updates keep coming from time to time, everything else is fine. However, this is all you get at this price, not an iPhone😀. Thank you 😊",NEGATIVE
"Replaced my 5 yrs old Redmi Note 7 pro (6+128gb) with 4+128 version of 13c 5G. The Redmi note 7 pro had costed me 14k and I got 2.8k under exchange plus another 300 as cashback so this 13c costed me effectively 5.9k only. And I Must say for this given price, the phone has not disappointed at all thus far. UI Experience is same and as good as my earlier phone (which I was habitual of), thus was a smooth experience to transition to the new device. Screen quality is super awesome, Camera is just okaish (Below par for a 50MP lens - but you can't ask for an iphone pro max quality at this price), battery is lasting more than 1.5-2 days on a full charge and normal usage as I am not into gaming or other heavy usage. The only con is it takes a good duration of time to charge up. I am using an 18w charger (recommended higher limit) and it takes about 3-4 hrs at min to charge it fully. (Users tend to make a mistake by using higher than recommended chargers in order to charge fast and thus end up damaging their Phones ICs). The charger provided along with the box is standard 10w charger which is useless and I am not using anyways. On the storage, I feel128 gb is more than enough as it was same in my old phone and after using it for 5 years I could use only 90gb of it. For the RAM, again I felt 4 gb should be more than enough as previous 6gb version always showed idle RAM capacity of 3.5-4 GB. And using it till now have not felt any lag or so in normal operations. No heating issues as such. Sound quality is fine. If you are a normal/conservative smartphone user, this is the Best phone you will find under this budget. Even if it lasts another 4-5 years, :) , it would be a complete Paisa vasool. Let's hope it does last that long. And this is also to set an example in an era where people are going crazy/gungho about phones exceeding 1.5lacs with blah blah features, that, if used properly, even a 6k smartphone can serve you equally well ;)",NEGATIVE
"Cons: Charger is just 10w provided so poor charging time, No secondary microphone so No background voice cancellation, OS patching update is slow, Screen is IPS panel i guess, Poor rear camera, No back cover, Bloatwares, ok single speaker, No IR blaster.  Pros: Good looks, Performance is decent with 6gb ram, Battery backup is Good, Display is decent, 3.5mm jack, type C port  Decent phone for parents. But go for better alternative phone’s for better camera, Os updates , good charging support, Amoled display but you need purchase separate type C charger.",NEGATIVE
Best phone at this price. The only problem is phone freezes sometimes in between for 2 to 3 secs or after turning on the internet.,NEGATIVE
"Performance is really good, speed, phone quality is nice, no heating issues , touch is super smooth , looks amazing",POSITIVE
Bought it for my uncle who is living in remote forest area where mobile signal is very feeble. In most of the mobile sets we didn't get the coverage whereas this model working fine with voice call and on net calls. Battery charge is standing for nearly one day and it takes roughly one hour for full charge. The only con is the sound effect is little bit low.,NEGATIVE
"The phone feels great in my hand, shine looks awesome.  Pros: * expandable RAM from 4 GB to 4GB+2GB/4+4 GB or even more * performance is good when upgraded software to hyperOS * Decent battery life for basic to intermediate tasks * Smooth Multitasking * Big Display * Power button as Fingerprint sensor  Cons: * A little heat up is experienced while gaming * Front Selfie Camera is not Great as of our Last Redmi Note Series Phone * Little Laggy for 2-3 minutes just after restarting device afterwards smooth run * Fast charge, but Not quick charging as the Adapter included is of 20W, I used a 30W adapter and is was quickly charging.  I’m impressed with the Design and more over the ram expandable feature which takes memory from storage to expand ram, and you can choose to keep 4GB or expand to 6 or 8 GB as well.",POSITIVE
Good,POSITIVE

"I've been using the iPhone 16 Pro Max for over a month, and I'm blown away by its sheer performance, stunning display, and revolutionary camera capabilities.

"I love the iPhone 16 Pro Max. It's big, powerful, and up for anything. Yes, I play a console-level game on it without any issue.

"Really very good phone. Very good Camera quality, software, performance, build quality, display & superb battery life 😍😍😍",POSITIVE
Don’t buy from amazon they give you defective phone and the return policy is also fake as they don’t let you return or replace the product. Even in the given time period,NEGATIVE
"Nice , mind blowing and phone",POSITIVE
"Excellent phone, Apple Intelligence is amazing, the battery life is mind blowing and comes with the best camera. If you have a 13 Pro Max or older, go for it. If you have a 14 Pro Max, the only difference you are going to see is Apple Intelligence, better battery life and slightly better cameras. Otherwise it's going to feel like the exact same phone if you use it without a case as the rounded eges in 16 Pro Max are better to use without cases. Skip and save money if you have the 15 Pro Max because the difference is negligible. The black titanium color looks gorgeous and the only good color in the current series. It's a shame they removed the Blue Titanium color. Also costs 15-20k less than the launch price of 15 Pro Max so that is a huge plus.",NEGATIVE
"I did not like it at first. Its my first iPhone. I have used Samsung, Oneplus and Xiaomi phones. 16 Pro Max has many flaws. Android is much better now. But iOS is very smooth.  Things I liked: 1. Speakers are amazing. 2. Battery life is good. 3. Overall smoothness. 4. Camera is great.  Things I did not like: 1. All the Web Browsers (Safari or others) are limited to 60hz. 2. No option for menu bar navigation (android has both gestures and bar). 3. Display / Screen color is fixed at Natural tone (no option for Vivid etc). 4. Restricted files/folder access and many other UI limitations. 5. Managing Whatsapp media is a mess (its much simpler on android). 6. Telephoto 5X images are too soft. 7. No separate Camera folder in Photos app for the photos you take with your phone.",NEGATIVE
Very expensive. Better if. Ur upgrading after a couple of years. Best video cameras on a smartphone bt apple should come out with something innovative or change their design. This looks very similiar to previous products. Great camera. Top notch in every department.,POSITIVE
"Just 3 days review with phone: Pros: 1 Light weight with large battery, easily one day backup for heavy use(should put refresh rate at auto, )even with 5 g 2.Good display for media consumption 3.Good main camera- decent night, and potraits pics for the price,super moon mode is cherry on top 4.Fast charging 5.No heating issue while charging or gaming  Cons: 1.Fun touch os, filled with bloatwares, need to uninstall those and turn off all toggles of v app store, 2.Shuld take care of phone like a baby,as display and edge protection is mandatory..if not a display change could cause half of phones price, 3.If u hv obsession for curved display like me then this phone is the value for money for 25k, if not don't go for this (Based on regular software updates ,better performance, less heating issue and service centre availability I considered this over moto edge 50 fusion, but it has gorilla glass protection ,stock android os and vegan leather finishes with more color options)",NEGATIVE
"It's been a month using this phone (12/256 variant) No lag while gaming(Iqoo is known for it), also there are many features related to gaming..bgmi runs in hdr 60fps..Camera is excellent for potraits..display is also good with various features.. battery is enough for whole day.. overall a all-rounder ❤️ Although the delivery took 20 days that's the only negetive point",POSITIVE
"iQOO Z9s Pro - 8/256GB - 25 January 2025. iQOO did not disappoint. This is an amazing gadget to own. Very good camera, both front 16mp and rear 50mp, producing detailed well-balanced photos with very natural colour tones. Snapdragon 7 Gen 3- super powerful for all functionality. Fast and very accurate finger print reading. It has proper curved display. It will be difficult to maintain this. And you'll never find a satisfactory screen guard ever. But that was expected. But the display is aesthetically pleasing. In-hand feel also is just amazing with no sharp edges.  5000+ battery - it last to the second day easily. And 80W power adaptor charges it in around 30 minutes to full.!!!  Under 25000 Rs. its a great value for money device. And iQOO brand, I felt, is very reliable. This is my second iQOO phone.  Overall its a great value for money.",POSITIVE
"Phone looks fine, performance is good, the phone look is premium with curve screen, The camera quality is awesome in this range. Overall its Value for money package.",POSITIVE
Battery life is good. Good gaming performance. display is also smooth and fast. No hanging and sound is very nice and clear sound. In 25k out of imagination. Very nice Vivo and IQOO.❤️,POSITIVE
Yeah! iQOO z9spro 5g is the phone who is looking for a good sleek design and moderate gamers and good battery life with an above average camera . I think the phone design is much better I feels iQOO z7 pro is a good design and overall phone It is an upgrade version of the last gen and in-hand hand feel is awesome and if you want good phone around 25k it's the allrounder than grab it ⭐⭐⭐1/2 it's my rating to these funtouch os may improve further. So thank you Vivo for bringing these phones at these price range.,POSITIVE
"This phone is one of the best options in its segment, offering an exceptional display with vibrant colors and sharp clarity. The camera performance is outstanding, capturing detailed and crisp photos in various lighting conditions. In terms of performance, it handles multitasking and gaming effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for everyday use. While the overall experience is fantastic, I found the speakers to be slightly underwhelming. However, this is a minor drawback in an otherwise excellent device that delivers on almost every front.""",POSITIVE
"I gave it 4 stars. The selfie camera could have been better. The battery is good, the back camera is also good. I am giving a review after using it for 9 days. This mobile is okay for this price.",POSITIVE
"I have been using the OnePlus 12R for a while, and I’m extremely impressed with its overall performance.Snapdragon chipset ensures a seamless and lag-free experience, whether I’m gaming or multitasking.  The battery life is outstanding, and the super-fast charging is a game-changer. The camera quality is impressive, capturing vibrant and detailed shots even in low light.  I also appreciate the sleek and premium design—it feels great in hand and looks stunning. The OxygenOS software is smooth, customizable, and free from unnecessary bloatware, enhancing the overall user experience.  For its price, the OnePlus 12R delivers excellent value. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and powerful smartphones.",POSITIVE
"Easily one of the best purchases that I have made and well worth its price. Pros: - SD 8 Gen 2 is fast and very power efficient. The performance is indistinguishable in day to day usage when compared to SD 8 Gen 3 on a OnePlus 12 with UFS 4.0. Even though the 12R has a UFS 3.1 storage, you are unlikely to notice any difference whatsoever without running benchmarks or checking the specifications. In real life day to day usage, I have not found any difference and I am a power user who uses a lot of applications and use the phone over 8 Hours a day.  - The vapour chamber handles the cooling very well which keeps the device at excellent temperature even when playing games for an extended duration. It almost never goes over 38c.  - The display has the same features as the OnePlus 12 (the resolution is relatively lower but it's not noticeable to the naked eye without magnification) and this is one of the best displays that you will come across. The HDR performance is also some of the best I have seen and it is a completely different experience. This can also be seen in the HDR shots taken with cameras. I'd suggest going to a OnePlus experience center and searching for 12K HDR videos on YouTube to get a better idea. Note that the 4,500 nits mentioned is only the HDR brightness at a small white portion of the display under sunlight. This is NOT the max brightness of the full display. But it is bright enough to use under direct sunlight.  - Battery life is very impressive with over 8 hours of SOT and the 100W included charger fully charges it in about 35 mins.  - Also love that the display can be used even when your hands are wet unlike most other smartphones  - The bezels are extremely slim and the chin is smaller than the one on the OnePlus 12. I do wish it was equal all around though.  Rather than cons, I'll just mention what it lacks. - Wireless charging - Telephoto camera  That's pretty much it. If you are looking for a smooth and reliable device with solid performance, battery life, fast charging, decent cameras and display experience, I would easily recommend this. Sure the cameras may not be as good as an iPhone 15 (81k) or a Pixel 8 (83k) but they also cost around 80% more than the OnePlus 12R.",POSITIVE
"OnePlus smartphones are known for offering a solid combination of performance, design, and value. Here's a general breakdown of the brand,Performance: OnePlus phones usually come with high-end processors, such as Qualcomm Snapdragon chips, ensuring smooth performance for day-to-day tasks, gaming, and multitasking. Their OxygenOS software, based on Android, is often praised for being fast, clean, and customizable. Design: OnePlus phones typically have a sleek, premium design with minimal bezels, high-quality materials like glass and metal, and vibrant AMOLED displays. Their design language has evolved over time, often competing with flagship devices in terms of looks and feel. Camera: OnePlus has made significant strides in camera performance, with their recent models equipped with advanced camera sensors and multiple lenses, offering decent low-light performance, wide-angle shots, and sharp details.

The battery life is generally solid, though it can vary depending on the specific model.

"The OnePlus 12R is absolutely amazing! The camera is top-notch with a variety of modes that make every shot look professional. The storage capacity is impressive, ensuring I never run out of space for my photos, apps, and files. The performance is super smooth and the design feels premium in hand. Battery life easily lasts a day even with heavy usage. Overall, this phone is a perfect blend of style functionality, and value. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"The phone itself is fine. They don't include the Supervooc 80w power adapter. One Plus actually includes the power adapter with purchase. For the money you pay, you'd think it'd be included. Next time I will order right from the company.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus 12R stands out as a compelling choice for budget-conscious users seeking a feature-rich phone. It delivers a flagship-caliber display, exceptional battery life, and blazing-fast charging speeds. While the camera system caters more towards casual photographers, the OnePlus 12R packs the powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, ensuring smooth performance for everyday users and gamers alike. At its price point, the OnePlus 12R offers exceptional value.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G is a popular mid-range smartphone that balances affordability with some great features. Here’s a look at its unique pros and cons: Pros: 1. Affordable 5G Access: One of the more affordable options for experiencing 5G on a OnePlus device, offering high-speed connectivity without a high price tag. 2. High-Refresh-Rate Display: Its 6.72-inch LCD display with a 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling, gaming, and general use feel smoother compared to standard 60Hz screens. 3. Good Battery Life: Comes with a 5,000mAh battery that can last a full day with typical use, along with 67W fast charging, which can get the phone to around 80% in just about 30 minutes. 4. Solid Primary Camera: The 108MP primary sensor performs well in good lighting, capturing clear and detailed images, which is impressive for this price range. 5. OnePlus Software: OxygenOS, OnePlus's custom skin, is known for being clean, smooth, and less cluttered compared to some other Android skins.  Cons: 1. LCD Screen Instead of OLED: Unlike some competitors, it has an LCD instead of an OLED display, so colors aren’t as vibrant, and blacks are not as deep. 2. Limited Processor: The Snapdragon 695 chip is decent but not very powerful. It may feel a bit sluggish with more intensive tasks or high-end gaming. 3. Average Low-Light Photography: The camera’s low-light performance isn’t great, which may lead to noisy or blurry photos in dim settings.",POSITIVE
"I am writting this review after using the phone for more than a year. My satisfaction level is quite high for this phone. The built of mobile is so good. Look wise it is quite trendy. Performance is excellent. Quality of camera is very good. It comes with a super chager. Charging time of the mobile is very less. Back up is nice. After all it's a crafted mobile. It's worth every penny you spent . I have only small issues regarding the sound quality. When connected to bluetooth the sound is very low even at maximum volume. I specifically want to mention about it's water resistance quality. 'Marvellous' is what I would like to mention about it's resistivity towards ingress of water. My mobile fell down in water and remained under water for nearly 6 hours. When recovered, I was surprised to see the mobile still working nicely. All parameters were fine. Only SIMs were out of order due to water ingress in the SIM slot. I dried it up with a air blower, inserted the SIM and they started working fine. There was no water ingress to any other parts of the mobile. The net connectivity was working fine. This was a pleasant surprise to me. I have decided to buy only One plus for any future purchase. I highly recommend this.  Thank you One Plus.",POSITIVE
"After using the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G for a while, I’m quite impressed with what it offers at its price point. The 6.72-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate makes the screen incredibly smooth, especially while scrolling and playing games. The colors are vivid, and watching videos or browsing feels quite immersive.  The performance is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset, which has been decent for everyday tasks like browsing, using social media, and light gaming. Multitasking is seamless thanks to the 8GB RAM, and the phone handles most apps without lag. However, for more intense gaming or heavy usage, it can show some limitations compared to higher-end models.  One of the highlights for me is the 108MP main camera. It captures photos with impressive detail, especially in well-lit conditions. The colors are sharp, and it’s great for casual photography. Low-light performance, though, could be better, as the images sometimes appear grainy. The 16MP front camera works well for selfies, delivering clear and bright images.  Battery life is another strong point. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts me a full day with moderate use, and the 67W SUPERVOOC fast charging is incredibly quick—I can get from 0 to 80% in around 30 minutes, which is a lifesaver when I’m in a hurry.  In terms of design, the phone feels sturdy but lightweight, and the matte finish on the back is sleek without being too slippery. The only downside for me is that the phone lacks certain flagship features like water resistance or wireless charging, but at this price, it’s understandable.  Overall, I’d say the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G offers solid performance, a vibrant display, and excellent battery life for everyday users. It’s a great value for the price if you're looking for a mid-range 5G phone with reliable features.",POSITIVE

"This Mobile phone has some good features, but some drawback ... 1. Selfie camera video recording mirror problem (recorded opposite) that's software problem/bug. 2.

Other brand mobile (even Android 10/Android 14 4g/5g)app clone/dual app working so many installed app like Amazon etc, but this mobile only works whatsapp, Facebook (not for Facebook lite) 6. Sometimes annonymous call recording symbol missing from screen, that's software problem/bug. 7. Auto Rotation of screen too slow. This post after using 1 month",NEGATIVE
"Lava makes OEM phones for the global market and is one of the largest exporters. But it does not have the jazz of the other leading brands and you may not be able to flaunt this phone if you need a status symbol. But for the tech savvy, this is a great phone worth double it's offer price. So I say it's a silent campaign aiming to sell a quality phone to a quality conscious user. With Android 14, the software brings even greater value to the user.",POSITIVE
Lava O3 pro is a good choice under Rs.7000/- stock Android with out unnecessary apps. I am very much impressed with its display because even under sun light also display is visible. Next one is camera - both captures good pics. I think better in this price point. Battery also gives u one day easily for normal tasks. So any one needs a phone for day to day activities with a good camera please go with this phone. Thank You,POSITIVE
Surprisingly good product for the price. I have generally purchased the flagship phones of OnePlus with the assumption that they are better than the Nord-series. I now stand corrected. The NORD CE range is definitely an economical range and not meant for heavy usage but the Nord series are more than capable of taking on heavy usage. The camera is not great but at the price point it is more than adequate. The phone is well built and looks good. The finger print reader is quick and efficient. Phone functionality being almost bare bones androrid is high on user friendliness. A definite buy!,POSITIVE
"Bought the phone a month ago. Safe to say at this price range, for me, it's banger. A fast and smooth software experience and tough and durable hardware.  The oxygen os 15 update made the software smoother and brought some cool features as well. Battery gives an excellent backup, charges quick, the display is great and flat. Also the metal design is unique.  The only downside, or might i say, a slight disappointment is the camera. Not that good at this price. Still and over-all great one. Not even noticeable to the average user. Apart from that, One plus nailed it.",POSITIVE
"This is my first OnePlus device, before this iam user of poco believe me oxygen OS is far better than miui/ Hyper os. It's lag free,and very smoothly work, battery is al great, camera is not upto mark but ok. Performance is next level iam loving with it😎",POSITIVE
"I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4. It is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. I bought this phone during Great Indian festival after so much research and doubts. I was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. I was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. I don't want to compromise in any one thing. So after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. But in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. Curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. Now i feel it was the best decision. Best features of this Nord 4 are- Design - I literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. I thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. It cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all. Performance - It has the best performance and able to play BGMI so smoothly. Flat screen helps so much in games also. Battery - If you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins. Camera - I felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. If camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, Samsung or Iphone which are camera centric. But then other areas you have to compromise. Trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos. Network - Being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. Never felt any Issues at all. Display - It has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.  This review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for Oneplus Nord 4 for sure. Greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....  (If any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)",POSITIVE
"I've never had a OnePlus device before so I'll be totally unbiased over my experience for this phone since I bought it by the time of of first day launch🤗  1) Design: (9.5/10 Subjective) I love it but t's subjective is you prefer a glass built over a metal or the dual tone colours/texture appeals you less or more, but ultimately it's one of the most eye catching designs launched this year apart from the Nothing phones that has managed to attain a premium appearance in a very simple unibody structure.  2) Performance: (8.5/10) This is what makes it one of the top competitors within the 30k lineup phones. I personally play a lot of gatcha games like Genshin, Honkai and Wuthering Waves, over fps shooting so I would definitely say that gatcha games being heavier in graphics, Nord 4 is capable to provide the most efficient gaming. Practically speaking if you avoid those YouTube reviews with AnTuTu, any android phone would at some point face fps drop if you play in the highest settings and I do believe with what I've heard that even with high end processors like Snapdragon 7+ 3, OnePlus always limits it's potential which is why we do get to see some throttling, but on a long term it doesn't matter. If you are a daily user with 2-3 hours of heavy gaming per day or more with breaks after every 45 minutes to 1 hour of heavy graphic gameplay, then you could definitely have a great experience. If you are just a normal user, you can choose it blindly.  3) Built and UI: (9/10 for strength and quality but 7/10 for being expensive to replace) Ofcourse being metal you would expect a little bit of weight (around 200 grams) but you get used to it and it really feels much premium to feel that metallic weight in your hand. It might get really slippery and if it falls down it might not have scratches except for the glass portion around the camera but might face dents on the metal if the fall is too harsh, so I would suggest to have a back cover, and let's be honest no matter how premium the phone is even if it looks great, they are all at the end of the day sensitive and how you manage to care for it depends totally on you. Be responsible. And as I mentioned, it's going to be really expensive to replace a unibody metal frame if it's cracked or dented even if it's strong enough to work so be careful. As for the UI I've been a Xiaomi user so honestly I don't feel much different in terms of operating system with bloatware, but I really don't feel bothered by it as long as I'm able to disable it. I uninstalled and disabled not almost but EVERY single bloatware in this phone that I possibly could have including app market and even the gaming tool so now I don't get those security checks after installing apps and it feels as clean as any Flagship phone.  3) Battery: (8/10) It's good. Definitely better battery life than my iPhone BUT for how big the battery is, the Oxygen OS hasn't optimised it's battery life to it's maximum just as I mentioned before for its Processor but it's not a big deal. 5500mAH is something we see less as the price goes higher over handheld devices because they try to add more space for gimmicks like wireless charging which in my opinion is not very practical everytime unless you carry a wireless charger everywhere and they are really slow. But the wired charging in OnePlus with the 100 watt out of the box charger is great and it charges the device to full within 30 minutes tho I would suggest to toggle the option from Battery Health settings to charge it till 80 percentage so you can keep it's battery health stable for long. I hope they optimise it in the future updates but honestly it gives you around 7-8 hours of life with regular usage and even more if you are a light user which is more than enough considering that at some point you will need to charge your device any way.  4) Display: (8/10) It's a very smooth 120hz amoled panel with HDR support in Netflix that I never really use because I watch on my MacBook or the television (it's just better to watch anything on a bigger display over a phone to keep your visions safe) and an unnamed protection (Panda glass according to few sources) but I'll be practical over how much it actually matters. Being someone who has changed the displays in the past after getting it broken, it doesn't matter what Gorilla glass they put on your phone, it's a glass at the end of the day and if you are not being responsible enough by handling your phone with care, it's expected for your screen to face damage. Use a good tempered glass around 3-4 USD (200-400 INR) I won't suggest to go higher because no matter how expensive it is, even if it's able to handle a bend test, practically any tempered display is penetrable if it falls flat on a rough surface UNLESS you have a good thick back cover. Overall it's a good display but I feel that the brightness could be a bit bother outside if you live in a heavily bright environment. Personally I didn't face any issues for the time being as the peak brightness is really good in the sunlight but if you compare it to some cheaper devices, it might feel a little less.  5) Heating Stabilization: (9/10) I mean, it's metal? Ofcourse it's going to be hot DURING a gameplay but HEATING DOESN'T MEAN PERFORMANCE DROP. Also it's during the time when you are playing or doing some heavy task but the best part of metal is that it cools down as fast as it heats up and the cooling chamber in this phone is really efficient. Overall It's definitely better in terms of heat stabilization than any glass/plastic built phones for being a metal although I would say that, if you are travelling in a constantly hot temperature, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight for too long as it might get hot or else again, Use a back cover. BUT I'd also suggest to not use a back cover when doing some heavy gaming because it makes you loose the purpose of having a metal phone with such a good heating stabilization as plastic makes it harder to escape the heat.  6) Camera: (7/10 Subjective) This isn't my place but I would still give some opinion. It is decent and when I say that, it is actually not bad at all infact really good along it's limitations. It has a very natural tone on the back camera with a really good potrait mode and a decent front camera definitely better than a 25k phone but ofcourse with the specifications you see, there are limitations if you compare it to other phones in the same price. It's definitely better than Nothing 2a in terms of color and stability but not as close to camera centred phones like Vivo/Realme in the midrange but then again those phones lack either performance or the brand value, as OnePlus is much premium as a brand than Vivo/Realme even if they are from the same company. Again it is subjective and this phone in my opinion is rather a balance of performance along with the things you need in a midrange close-to-flagship phone rather than being an entire camera phone, but it's still really good even with the limitations of telephoto and other things that I find gimmick because I'm not a camera phone user.  Overall: (8.25) It's a great phone for both everyday users and decent to heavy gamers. I might score it higher in the future if they successfully optimise the Operating system in the future updates and push it to 9 even with a decent camera because this phone has a lot of potential and considering it's future update promises of 4+6 for Android and security patch, it's a very good purchase. Just praying that these phones don't face any green line issues in the future.",POSITIVE
"With CC discount, got it for a great bargain price. could not ask for more. Elegant, premium look. Wonderful camera, UI is also good. using it since 10 days, yet to explore many features. Battery life is also good, no worries. 100w superfact charing in 20 mins. Overall happy with the product.",POSITIVE
"AMAZING battery life , very calssy , best UI , easy to use Ai options , 10/10 design .  overall 4.8/5 I really like it .  but there is only 2 weakness i hope they solve it with a pro version i will be fist buyer :  1st camera : camera not that good , front and back camera is avarge or below average on some stuation 2nd wireless charging : yeah no wireless charging .",NEGATIVE

Very good item. Arrived quickly..my mother is very happy with it! Good quality for a reasonable price!,POSITIVE
"If you are in a budget and need a samsung phone then this is the phone for you. My initial choice was to buy some other phone but had to buy it from amazon cause they deliver products to my address in short time for specific products,as after delivery of the product in stepulated time I had some other travel plans and no other websites/app were delivering that quickly (depends if other websites or app delivers to your address in time and give you good deals on products then book yours product from them) coming to the product  What I liked  Usefull compact screen as I don't like too much big screens Amoled screen Battery backup Compact phone Decent camera without out too much colour boosting, natural images both front and back camera I'm not a gaming person so whatever multitasking and media consumption I had to do,the processer handled it smoothly can't say about the same performance after 2,3 years as company claimed to give four years of OS upgrades Calling quality, bluetooth functions,wifi all seems to working fine with my unit till this review writting  What I didn't like  it feels old fashioned because of notch in era of punch hole displays even in 6000 rupees phones,it has amoled screen but after comparing it with other phones which have full HD IPS displays with about 600 nits of brightness the screen brightness, direct sunlight visibility or the overall multimedia experience is almost the same compared to IPS displays phone of mine which I felt like there's not much of a difference so I think the amoled screen helps only conserving battery in long run  Charging speed is slow and you have to buy compatible 25watt charger separately which I feel is also slow coming from using variety of phones which I have with 30 watt charging which is the least I have been using and that 30 watt charging brick came along inside the phone box  Phone is bit heavy but no complain cause we know there's 6000mah battery, it maybe a deal breaker for some but I'm ok with it  Company mentioned it has Dolby Atmos support but after using the phone it feels like gimmick, sounds the same as any other under 15000 rupees phone  It has hybrid sim slot which I didn't liked as I use a SD card and 2 sim card at a time but don't know why all the companies abandoned giving dedicated sim slots under 15000 rupees phones so there's no choice for users(there are some old model phones with dedicated sim slots available online but they are nearing their end of service life)so had to buy this product what choice was there under the circumstances  No back cover was included in the box as 99% of other phone companies are provided them in this price range  Will give you update in coming months if somethings happen regarding the phone",NEGATIVE
Is real good and the battery was awesome need to charge only wants and it work all day amazing phone.,POSITIVE
"The phone weight is a little bit too much almost 215gms, which is too much. The camera is good and the battery is okay. The backside of the phone is anti fingerprint so it’s good. The durability of the phone is quite nice in this price range. And the screen is amoled display and has 90 hertz, if it is 120 hertz it can be better.  Overall if u are looking for a Samsung phone in this range u can go for it.",POSITIVE
"After use of 3 weeks, I have following comments on important aspects of the phone: 1. Display - a big disappointment. Does not feel anything like Super AMOLED. The brightness is okay for indoors, but pathetic outdoors. My earlier phone with 480-nits LCD was brighter. 2. Battery - Great. Lasts more than 2 days (but I don't play heavy games). 3. Calls and Sound - Very good. The single speaker delivers crisp audio and call volume. 4. Cameras: Below average. Daylight pics on main cam are okay. Indoor pics are very soft and grainy. Wide angle and Macro are of no practical use. Front cam is just okay for selfies and video calls. 5. Processor and speed - Good for day-to-day normal usage. You don't expect much from Dimensity 6100+. It is okay for moderate usage. Smoothness is average. 6. Software - Tons of bloatware. It is a tedious task to uninstall / disable them and still you get lots of notifications. 7. The phone tends to heat up during long calls, so better to use earbuds.  This is not what I expected from a Super AMOLED phone from Samsung.",NEGATIVE
"This phone covers everything in reasonable price- looks, screen quality, camera, space processor etc. Got this phone for my parents and it is very easy for them to use, they really liked the screen clarity and camera. Very good phone in 11k price. Highly recommend for parents and first time smart phone users.",POSITIVE
"Charging speed good, connectivity good ,phone functions good ,sound quality good, battery life good, thank you",POSITIVE
Using the mobile is almost 10 days now. The best thing about the mobile is battery life. It's runnes almost 1 and half day after the full charge for normal users like me (I don' play games so can't tell gaming experience). Cameras is also pretty good compering it's price range. Mobile is little bit heavier (Obviously 6000 mah battery). The biggest con is Samsung is not providing 25w charger which you have to buy from market. Which will cost again 1k nearly. But overal the experience is satisfying.,POSITIVE
"The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G offers an attractive package, especially for users seeking solid performance at a budget-friendly price. Here’s a closer look at its key aspects:  Design and Display:  The Aqua Flow variant looks sleek with its gradient finish, adding a touch of elegance. The phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, making it easy for one-handed use. Its 6.58-inch Full HD+ display is sharp and vibrant, offering good color reproduction and brightness for media consumption. Though not AMOLED, the display performs well in outdoor lighting conditions and provides smooth scrolling with a 120Hz refresh rate.  Performance:  Powered by the Dimensity 6300 5G chipset, this device ensures a snappy and fluid user experience. It handles multitasking well, although the 4GB RAM might struggle slightly with heavier apps and games when compared to 6GB or 8GB variants. For regular usage like social media, video streaming, and casual gaming, the phone performs admirably. The inclusion of 5G support is a strong future-proofing move, especially at this price point.  Camera:  The 50MP Sony AI Camera setup is one of the phone’s strongest features. It takes good-quality pictures in daylight with sharp details and vivid colors. However, low-light performance could be better, as images tend to get noisy in dim environments. The AI optimizations, such as scene recognition, enhance the photography experience, making it easy to capture decent shots with minimal effort. The front camera is decent for selfies and video calls, though not exceptional.  Battery and Charging:  The phone packs a 5000mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day of moderate use. The charger in the box is a nice touch, offering fast charging support that gets the phone charged in under two hours. Battery optimization is good, ensuring you won’t run out of juice during regular day-to-day tasks.  Storage and Software:  With 128GB of storage, there’s ample room for apps, media, and files, and the phone supports microSD expansion if needed. The software experience is clean and customizable with iQOO’s Funtouch OS, which runs smoothly on Android. The UI is user-friendly, though there are some pre-installed apps that may not be necessary, but they can be uninstalled.  Verdict:  The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G is a competitive mid-range smartphone with solid performance, 5G support, a reliable camera, and good battery life. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly 5G phone with a stylish design, it’s a solid pick, but the 4",POSITIVE
"I am reviewing this after fully used and drop, ip test with pros and cons. If you want a phone with great performance, decent Camara also with latest Android 14 under 12k this phone will be perfect.. Best things are it's comes with Android 14 with funtouch os (if you are previously Vivo user you will got this) which is a great experience for me as 1st time user. On these segment its comes with 50 mp Sony IMX sensor 😘 with popular modes like slomo, which is really appreciated for budget lovers.. It's also supported 2k resolution with no lag..🤩 You will get 6gb ram with auto booster and 128 gb variant under 12k, it's a massive storage on budget..🤗 Ip64 with dust resistant, I have compared with other phones on this budget they have ip54 with no dust resistant feature..😄 This are the main points that I liked much, also I liked the wifi 5, fingerprint it's really fast with no animation, less bloat apps, ultra game mode etc..😉 Let's see the cons that I've got..😑🥴 Charging watt should be better at least 20 watts with inbox charger, 10 watt charger comes with it but the phone is supported 25 watt fast charging.. but 5000mah is good for long lasting uses.. charging time 5-80% was 1.15 hrs with inbox charger. Display should be comes with at least type IPS, it's comes with LCD display and decent colour gamut and 90hz gives most of all other phones on these budget. 1080p display will be much appreciated.. Design is good but if you have seen the poco c61 design that is comes with new radial cam design, so it's a disappointed because that's a under 7k phone..😆 Animation uses cause phone slower than usual..bso I will suggest not to use that..  Overall seen, decent Camera and Design, great performance (I will suggest to buy 6gb variant) with 5g variant, full day battery backup (for less gamers), IP64 with dust resistant 😍, latest Android 14 with 2 years of major upgrades and 3 years of security updates, handy weight with silicon cover on box.. Overall good on these budget segment with trust of VIVO.. 🫶",NEGATIVE

"I purchased Apple 16 128GB on 16/Jan/2025 started using it from 17/Jan battery is draining even though its idle, authorized service center also confirmed and they gave a service record letter (after lot of conversation the representative hardly agreed to upload the document he is really not suitable to continue in the position) i uploaded the report to amazon, when i choose for replacement Amazon says they need another letter from Authorized service center, as expected they Apple never gave any denied report to anyone, now i don't have option to either replace and cancel.  Amazon customer care is really not helpful, better don't buy any products from amazon website offers by attracted, they will send a defective /refurbished/re-used devices..  Amazon you loss the trust and belief of a valued customer who paid 80,000/- on a product  My sincere suggestion to those who want buy any apple product better visit the store and purchase from there.",NEGATIVE

No one helped.,NEGATIVE
"The phone has a nice display and good look like premium phone. Processor is smooth enough to enjoy the necessary apps as well as gaming experience, though not ultra smooth. Battery is remarkable for its long lasting performance which many branded mobiles fail to do so. In battery section few features are available to restrict unnecessary usage of battery. It has a number of privacy settings including 'secure card' and especially the feature that no one is able to swith it off without providing pin or pattern password. This is helpful if device is stolen. Though a handful of unnecessary apps are pre-installed, one can easily uninstall or disable them if not found helpful. The 'Phone Master' itself clears most of the cache memories and cools down the temperature. In my opinion one should restrict the 'usage access' and 'modify system settings' of the apps in the apps' special permissions section as well as unrestricted data or battery usage. Then the device will run more fluently without being stumbled or fumbled. Last but not the least, the device runs on latest android 14 version along with 6300 mdt dimensity processor which is worthwhile in this price range.",POSITIVE
"The TECNO POP 9 5G in Midnight Shadow is a solid budget smartphone with impressive 5G connectivity, ample 128GB storage, and smooth 4GB RAM performance.

Overall, it’s a fantastic option for everyday use without breaking the bank!",POSITIVE

But the wired charging in OnePlus with the 100 watt out of the box charger is great and it charges the device to full within 30 minutes tho I would suggest to toggle the option from Battery Health settings to charge it till 80 percentage so you can keep it's battery health stable for long. I hope they optimise it in the future updates but honestly it gives you around 7-8 hours of life with regular usage and even more if you are a light user which is more than enough considering that at some point you will need to charge your device any way.  4) Display: (8/10) It's a very smooth 120hz amoled panel with HDR support in Netflix that I never really use because I watch on my MacBook or the television (it's just better to watch anything on a bigger display over a phone to keep your visions safe) and an unnamed protection (Panda glass according to few sources) but I'll be practical over how much it actually matters. Being someone who has changed the displays in the past after getting it broken, it doesn't matter what Gorilla glass they put on your phone, it's a glass at the end of the day and if you are not being responsible enough by handling your phone with care, it's expected for your screen to face damage. Use a good tempered glass around 3-4 USD (200-400 INR) I won't suggest to go higher because no matter how expensive it is, even if it's able to handle a bend test, practically any tempered display is penetrable if it falls flat on a rough surface UNLESS you have a good thick back cover. Overall it's a good display but I feel that the brightness could be a bit bother outside if you live in a heavily bright environment. Personally I didn't face any issues for the time being as the peak brightness is really good in the sunlight but if you compare it to some cheaper devices, it might feel a little less.  5) Heating Stabilization: (9/10) I mean, it's metal? Ofcourse it's going to be hot DURING a gameplay but HEATING DOESN'T MEAN PERFORMANCE DROP. Also it's during the time when you are playing or doing some heavy task but the best part of metal is that it cools down as fast as it heats up and the cooling chamber in this phone is really efficient. Overall It's definitely better in terms of heat stabilization than any glass/plastic built phones for being a metal although I would say that, if you are travelling in a constantly hot temperature, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight for too long as it might get hot or else again, Use a back cover. BUT I'd also suggest to not use a back cover when doing some heavy gaming because it makes you loose the purpose of having a metal phone with such a good heating stabilization as plastic makes it harder to escape the heat.  6) Camera: (7/10 Subjective) This isn't my place but I would still give some opinion. It is decent and when I say that, it is actually not bad at all infact really good along it's limitations. It has a very natural tone on the back camera with a really good potrait mode and a decent front camera definitely better than a 25k phone but ofcourse with the specifications you see, there are limitations if you compare it to other phones in the same price. It's definitely better than Nothing 2a in terms of color and stability but not as close to camera centred phones like Vivo/Realme in the midrange but then again those phones lack either performance or the brand value, as OnePlus is much premium as a brand than Vivo/Realme even if they are from the same company. Again it is subjective and this phone in my opinion is rather a balance of performance along with the things you need in a midrange close-to-flagship phone rather than being an entire camera phone, but it's still really good even with the limitations of telephoto and other things that I find gimmick because I'm not a camera phone user.  Overall: (8.25) It's a great phone for both everyday users and decent to heavy gamers. I might score it higher in the future if they successfully optimise the Operating system in the future updates and push it to 9 even with a decent camera because this phone has a lot of potential and considering it's future update promises of 4+6 for Android and security patch, it's a very good purchase. Just praying that these phones don't face any green line issues in the future.",POSITIVE
"With CC discount, got it for a great bargain price. could not ask for more. Elegant, premium look. Wonderful camera, UI is also good. using it since 10 days, yet to explore many features.

"like the camera quality, value for money, style, and mobile performance of the cell phone. They mention it has a nice design, excellent 5G speed, and a big long-lasting battery. Customers also appreciate the sound quality, camera clarity, and touch quality Advanced Al Features: The Al-driven functionalities are truly remarkable. From optimizing the phone's performance to enhancing user experience, everything feels smart and intuitive. 108MP Ultra Clear Al Camera: The camera performance blew me away! The 108MP clarity is exceptional, and the Al enhancements make every shot stunning, whether it's day or night. D6300 Powerful Processor: The D6300 processor handles multitasking and gaming smoothly.

In-Built Infrared and NFC: These features add extra convenience, especially for controlling devices and making contactless payments.",POSITIVE
"Buying the TECNO POVA 6 NEO for ₹13,999 feels like a waste, especially with the misleading claims about the AI camera. The phone only supports 16 AI-generated photos and doesn’t offer 4K video recording. It has a 108MP rear camera, but no additional lenses, limiting its ability to take different types of photos. The front camera pictures also lose quality when zoomed in, which isn’t great.  On top of that, the phone doesn’t have Gorilla Glass or any other protective screen, making it easy to scratch. Even though it has a 5000mAh battery, it doesn’t last a full day, and the 18W charging is slow, with noticeable heating issues when charging.  The camera doesn’t perform well in low light, so night photography is disappointing. The phone also heats up during gaming, which affects its performance. Without Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), videos aren’t very stable, especially when moving or shooting handheld.  The 6.67-inch LCD screen, with a resolution of 1600x720 pixels (HD+), is below average, and it doesn’t look as clear as other phones in this price range. Even though TECNO claims the phone has a 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling through apps like YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook feels laggy after using it for a while.  TECNO also advertises a 12-month OTTPlay subscription with a scratch code included in the box, but the code doesn’t work after just a month, which is frustrating.  The phone has dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, but the sound during WhatsApp video calls or on loudspeaker isn’t as loud as expected. For the price, this kind of quality just isn’t good enough.",NEGATIVE
"At this price this phone offers a lot of useful features. 1. Phone design and display is excellent. Phone looks like a premium flagship model. 2. Battery can easily last for around 2 days with normal day to day usage. 3. Many intersting and useful AI features at this price range. 4. It has got many smart features which feels really good and amazing like dynamic port , smart panel, AI wallpaper, AI text board 5. Massive storage and memory 6. Screen size is good and big 7. Sound is loud with top and bottom speakers 8. Rear camera is good takes good pictures but front camera is average. 9. No ultrawide features available. 10. Camera has few new features like vlog, sky shop, AI generator , AI eraser, stickers, dual video, portrait video which are amazing and useful. Overall this phone offers a wide range of features and is a good buy at this price range.",POSITIVE

"This is one value for money product. Resolution is not good but have every other features at this price. Do not expect extraordinary at this price point. Have 256 gb storage, NFC, AI enabled, Decent camera, This is a good budget buy.",POSITIVE
"Though cost wise phone is good but some of the key features not working well or low quality 1) Display auto brightness is not as effective as it's in other mobile like MI phone. 2) Speaker quality is not good 3) Call recording there are no much options if I need to selec only few contacts to record. Quality of recording is horrible...it's echoing and my voice is high and other end voice is low. 4) Finger print or biometric touch is not so great especially when u set to unlock the screen after pressing power button 5) Display and touch I can say ok. 6) While u r on WhatsApp video call and when u receive regular, WhatsApp app hangs and closes itself. U need to restart the WhatsApp video call again",NEGATIVE

"First of all, it reminded me the old Nokia 225 ☺️, same type keyboard, large in size but low in resolution display. If you want to get the same Nostalgia feelings in 2024..... Go for it.....  Negatives🤥: 1. No features at all(Its a feature phone😂) 2. It doesn't even have any option to turn On or Off Mobile Data(Yes it's ridiculous 😒) 3. No OS, Jio Store, No Apps... So no time wasting 😁 4. Yes it has Jio Tv, Cinema, but the quality is too vivid, I left watching TV🤪 5. Basic but important for me: No auto Capitalization, so when try to save a contact every time need to change 1st letter capital, Good for fingering though😜 6. It even doesn't support HD photos, so it's really hard to find a good wallpaper for it(Yes longtime back, searching for wallpaper, pure Nostalgia 🤗) 7. D-pad or Navigation buttons are all AI powered, yes true.... You customize four directional buttons, it automatically resets to default (Very intelligent 🫡) 8. Company provided charger is so damm powefull, I just blinked, its gets supercharged.. Amazing🤩  Now the confusing part, Display... Yes it is large compared to others, but I guess it's resolution might be 240x320, 90's kids are so familiar with this reso. So it offers you the All time favorite of 90's 3gp quality video.. Yes Jio TV, Cinema all are in 3gp quality video, So enjoy the old days.. cheers..  Positives👌 1. Looks Pretty Classy😎 Yes it doesn't look cheaper or toy like, it's elegant compared to it's price. Build quality, I didn't dare to drop test🙄 2. Battery🔋 Its the best part of this phone.. It lasts long... really long😉 3. Camera 📷 of course it has one, but not for the photography but for the name and probably for payment too.. atleast it has one😏 4. It supports any Jio Sim, no need to buy one, and also Jio Bharat plans like 123 support is the perfect reason to choose it.. Old Jio phone recharges like 75, 91 doesn't support..  I couldn't setup the Jio Pay, after spending 50sms for verification, if anyone can help me, please you are welcome..  So overall, it's a good phone for Dada-Dadi's, Nana-Nani's, and also for students who wants to divert from reels, as well as for those who wants a secondary phone for basic calling and staffs.. ""Jio Dan Dhana Dhan 🤸‍♀️🤸‍♂️""",NEGATIVE
"I purchased for my father for calling and messages. Little bit songs and movies.  Good futures are Display & brightness, clear & loud calling, jio apps, battery. Recharge plans also cheeper then other networks  Missing futures is WiFi, hotspot, WhatsApp  I don't have major issue with the phone.",NEGATIVE
I thought Jio Saavn podcasts also will be available on this phone. But Jio Saavn version in this phone is a very limited version and there's no access to podcasts and all songs.  Radio & torch are working fine. This OS is not at all good compared KaiOS. Sometimes phone hangs. And there's no internal memory also even to save some 800 contacts. You must purchase a memory card to use any other multimedia.  It's Just a phone only to talk & Radio. Can't expect anything more from it.,NEGATIVE
Youtube not working.,NEGATIVE
"The best keypad mobile and handy for my grandmaa, The Loved it because she love to listen Bhajans And This Jio Mobile is easy for fuctions.",POSITIVE
"Build quality of this phone is the only point of my concern. This seems to be on little bit cheaper side. The software is very fluid and smooth. The old jio phone was very laggy. Although it has nothing as compared to old jio phone, but again the sole purpose of this phone is to be a feature phone not a smartphone so justified. The battery backup is superb. Buttons are responsive. Speaker is very loud. Display is comfortable. Although as it is 2.8 inch but ppi is same as of 2.4 inches so the quality is not that great. This phone is not like sturdy and durable, it can easily break if not handled with care. The old jio phone was very durable.",NEGATIVE
Good and quality,POSITIVE
"I've been using the realme Narzo N61 (Marble Black, 4GB RAM+64GB Storage) for a few weeks, and while it shows promise, it falls short in some areas.  Pros:  1. 90Hz Eye Comfort display: Smooth visuals, reduced eye strain. 2. IP54 dust and water resistance: Added durability. 3. 48-month fluency promise: realme's commitment to software updates. 4. Charger included: Convenient. 5. Affordable price point.  Cons:  1. Performance issues: Device can be slow, especially with multitasking. 2. Occasional lag and freezing: Frustrating experience. 3. Display touch issues: Unresponsive or inaccurate touch registration. 4. Limited storage (64GB): May require frequent cleaning or expansion.  Key Features:  - 6.5"" HD+ display - MediaTek Helio G35 processor - 4GB RAM, 64GB storage (expandable up to 1TB) - 48MP primary camera, 2MP macro, 2MP depth sensor - 5000mAh battery - Android 12 (Realme UI 3.0)  Verdict:  The realme Narzo N61 has potential, but its performance and display issues hold it back. If you prioritize smooth performance and responsive touch, consider alternatives.  Recommendation:  Ideal for:  - Basic users (calling, texting, social media) - Casual gaming (non-demanding titles)  Not recommended for:  - Demanding gamers - Multitaskers - Those seeking seamless performance  Rating Breakdown:  - Display: 3.5/5 (touch issues) - Performance: 3.0/5 (slow, laggy) - Battery: 4.0/5 - Camera: 3.5/5 - Value: 4.5/5  Suggestions for realme:  1. Optimize software for better performance. 2. Improve display touch sensitivity. 3. Consider upgrading storage options.  Would I recommend this product? Only for basic users.  Please note that this review is based on my personal experience. Your mileage may vary.",NEGATIVE
Best mobile in budget range,POSITIVE
Everything is great but has slow internet access like even in high speed wifi the phone can only access slow speeds with buffering internet and only useful for small tasks like social media cannot handle huge tasks like gaming. Screen size is gud. Sound quality could be better but it sounds ok with single speaker,POSITIVE
"It works well, battery backup is good stays for upto a day in normal usage, charging speed is also fast, little to no heating when used light, It is well and good for elderly people who need a phone for their usage, sound quality is fine.",POSITIVE

Touch Screen performance not good ..very slagesh.,NEGATIVE
"It's a good mobile for this price. Camera good. Battery Ok. But charger is not good, must be atleast 45W.",NEGATIVE
"The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.  While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.  This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.  Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.  Hits: The resolution is good No heating issues with the battery Battery life is good Charge time is good  Misses: Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached) The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinches Despite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button presses A few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlock The camera is average with washed out colours  Will add more later.  Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can’t be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.",NEGATIVE
Value for money,POSITIVE
Nice mobile Camera: Average camera Battery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile. Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled range Audio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice. Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that. Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.,POSITIVE
"As I'm using this device as a secondary device.. So overall it good. 1. coming to camera the I'm also a redmi note 8 pro user which gives 64mp but still I can see photos are much better in that phone redmi 13 have 108mp but does not looks like that according to the quality and video recording resolution is low that only give a 30fps of shooting in 1080 & 720p 2. battery is good & yeah charging fast no doubtedly 3. I'm in love with the ui its quite smooth may be because its new phone but according to to my previous experience with redmi phones it very nice... 4. reso;ution is also good as compared to the price range 5. hybrid sim slot, 5g, 6gb ram as well as virtual ram is also there In summary I can say u can buy this phone if you do moderate work on phone with the good enough battery backup",POSITIVE

"When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day. First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ₹ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features. It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time. Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later. I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone. I don't agree. The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.  I thought of displacing the phone. There was no option of displacement in this. There was an option to repair and damage. Then I would apply. Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it. I rarely do that. It is lying like that. I will recommend the phone to you. Don't buy this phone. If you look at the brand.",NEGATIVE

"Here are my genuine experience after using this phone since 2-3 days. # What's are good in this phone: >Battery is Ok Ok (it's 4G phone, obviously consumes less power). >Dual stereo speakers, sounds well during multimedia plays.  # What's are bad in this phone: >Software is not up to the mark. Not even for daily uses apps. Apps take reloading just only 2 min of inactivity. >Island punch hole is just for hike in the market. Not for any use. >Not given some useful functions like double tap to on/off. Given only some limited functions. >Camera platform is not looking good. >Over whole phone is very very laggy. You will literally irritated after just using 10 min of use.  Final review: If you have budget below 7k, there are a lot of options in the market in this price range. Don't trust on the YouTube's review.",NEGATIVE

Its the best phone you can buy,POSITIVE
"Good basic phone. It is runs in android 14 go version. Few functions are not available such as app lock or three finger screenshot etc. Battery is sturdy and lasts more than two days. You can't change the navigation switches. Back switch remains left. Phone is not very fast. However you can reduce the window animation scale to get some speed. It is better also to disable or uninstall ( whichever available) the unnecessary apps. Display is quite nice, so are the speaker and camera. It is certainly not for gaming purpose because processor is mediatek Helio G36 which is not very fast. I personally have experienced less lag so far in basic functions. Moderate weight charging speed.",NEGATIVE

"Well after a lit of deliberation finally settled for Samsung A35. Have been using samsung A22 for quite sometime now and wanted to switch over to moto or one plus but after a lot of review I brought this phone. For an average user this phone is worth it. The display is amazing, the camera is really good and the phone works pretty smoothly. No complaints at all. I did not find any heating issue. The phone goes on for about a day with normal usage. I have been using usual media app like YouTube insta etc and the pictures and sound quality is very good. The are some AI features added which come very handy using your cam. Best part is 4 yrs of software updates which Samsung is guaranteed to deliver ND the phone is safe. I dropped the phone a few times but the screen is good. The only draw back is they do not provide charger or other accessories in the box. Also the charing is pretty slow takes more than an hr to charge up.  Else Samsung phones are very reliable. Happy with the product.",POSITIVE
It's a great phone in this bugdet range.,NEGATIVE
Good in midrange smartphone,POSITIVE
"I'm very disappointed with this Samsung product, camera quality is worse, battery have to charge every 2-3 hours of usage, heating problem, slow performance 😑 I regret of purchasing this product,",NEGATIVE

"If you are in a budget and need a samsung phone then this is the phone for you. My initial choice was to buy some other phone but had to buy it from amazon cause they deliver products to my address in short time for specific products,as after delivery of the product in stepulated time I had some other travel plans and no other websites/app were delivering that quickly (depends if other websites or app delivers to your address in time and give you good deals on products then book yours product from them) coming to the product  What I liked  Usefull compact screen as I don't like too much big screens Amoled screen Battery backup Compact phone Decent camera without out too much colour boosting, natural images both front and back camera I'm not a gaming person so whatever multitasking and media consumption I had to do,the processer handled it smoothly can't say about the same performance after 2,3 years as company claimed to give four years of OS upgrades Calling quality, bluetooth functions,wifi all seems to working fine with my unit till this review writting  What I didn't like  it feels old fashioned because of notch in era of punch hole displays even in 6000 rupees phones,it has amoled screen but after comparing it with other phones which have full HD IPS displays with about 600 nits of brightness the screen brightness, direct sunlight visibility or the overall multimedia experience is almost the same compared to IPS displays phone of mine which I felt like there's not much of a difference so I think the amoled screen helps only conserving battery in long run  Charging speed is slow and you have to buy compatible 25watt charger separately which I feel is also slow coming from using variety of phones which I have with 30 watt charging which is the least I have been using and that 30 watt charging brick came along inside the phone box  Phone is bit heavy but no complain cause we know there's 6000mah battery, it maybe a deal breaker for some but I'm ok with it  Company mentioned it has Dolby Atmos support but after using the phone it feels like gimmick, sounds the same as any other under 15000 rupees phone  It has hybrid sim slot which I didn't liked as I use a SD card and 2 sim card at a time but don't know why all the companies abandoned giving dedicated sim slots under 15000 rupees phones so there's no choice for users(there are some old model phones with dedicated sim slots available online but they are nearing their end of service life)so had to buy this product what choice was there under the circumstances  No back cover was included in the box as 99% of other phone companies are provided them in this price range  Will give you update in coming months if somethings happen regarding the phone",NEGATIVE
Is real good and the battery was awesome need to charge only wants and it work all day amazing phone.,POSITIVE
"The phone weight is a little bit too much almost 215gms, which is too much. The camera is good and the battery is okay. The backside of the phone is anti fingerprint so it’s good. The durability of the phone is quite nice in this price range. And the screen is amoled display and has 90 hertz, if it is 120 hertz it can be better.  Overall if u are looking for a Samsung phone in this range u can go for it.",POSITIVE
"After use of 3 weeks, I have following comments on important aspects of the phone: 1. Display - a big disappointment. Does not feel anything like Super AMOLED. The brightness is okay for indoors, but pathetic outdoors. My earlier phone with 480-nits LCD was brighter. 2. Battery - Great. Lasts more than 2 days (but I don't play heavy games). 3. Calls and Sound - Very good. The single speaker delivers crisp audio and call volume. 4. Cameras: Below average. Daylight pics on main cam are okay. Indoor pics are very soft and grainy. Wide angle and Macro are of no practical use. Front cam is just okay for selfies and video calls. 5. Processor and speed - Good for day-to-day normal usage. You don't expect much from Dimensity 6100+. It is okay for moderate usage. Smoothness is average. 6. Software - Tons of bloatware. It is a tedious task to uninstall / disable them and still you get lots of notifications. 7. The phone tends to heat up during long calls, so better to use earbuds.  This is not what I expected from a Super AMOLED phone from Samsung.",NEGATIVE
"This phone covers everything in reasonable price- looks, screen quality, camera, space processor etc. Got this phone for my parents and it is very easy for them to use, they really liked the screen clarity and camera. Very good phone in 11k price. Highly recommend for parents and first time smart phone users.",POSITIVE

Using the mobile is almost 10 days now. The best thing about the mobile is battery life. It's runnes almost 1 and half day after the full charge for normal users like me (I don' play games so can't tell gaming experience). Cameras is also pretty good compering it's price range. Mobile is little bit heavier (Obviously 6000 mah battery). The biggest con is Samsung is not providing 25w charger which you have to buy from market. Which will cost again 1k nearly. But overal the experience is satisfying.,POSITIVE
"It's a good mobile for this price. Camera good. Battery Ok. But charger is not good, must be atleast 45W.",NEGATIVE
"The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.  While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.  This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.  Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.  Hits: The resolution is good No heating issues with the battery Battery life is good Charge time is good  Misses: Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached) The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinches Despite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button presses A few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlock The camera is average with washed out colours  Will add more later.  Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can’t be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.",NEGATIVE
Value for money,POSITIVE
Nice mobile Camera: Average camera Battery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile. Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled range Audio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice. Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that. Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.,POSITIVE
"As I'm using this device as a secondary device.. So overall it good. 1. coming to camera the I'm also a redmi note 8 pro user which gives 64mp but still I can see photos are much better in that phone redmi 13 have 108mp but does not looks like that according to the quality and video recording resolution is low that only give a 30fps of shooting in 1080 & 720p 2. battery is good & yeah charging fast no doubtedly 3. I'm in love with the ui its quite smooth may be because its new phone but according to to my previous experience with redmi phones it very nice... 4. reso;ution is also good as compared to the price range 5. hybrid sim slot, 5g, 6gb ram as well as virtual ram is also there In summary I can say u can buy this phone if you do moderate work on phone with the good enough battery backup",POSITIVE
"Sound quality is good, processor seams great, I had received it a few hours ago, but the way I'm constantly using it shows the battery backup for it.",NEGATIVE
"When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day. First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ₹ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features. It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time. Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later. I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone. I don't agree. The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.  I thought of displacing the phone. There was no option of displacement in this. There was an option to repair and damage. Then I would apply. Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it. I rarely do that. It is lying like that. I will recommend the phone to you. Don't buy this phone. If you look at the brand.",NEGATIVE
Good phone,POSITIVE
"Camera, proccesor, charging speed, battery back up,gaming are sooo good in budget but the phone has two negatives 1.low brightness while watching videos 2. Support only 1080 p YouTube videos quality over all it was good mobile in budget",NEGATIVE
Value money,POSITIVE
"This is a completely honest and true review that I am writing after using the phone. This phone is absolutely not good; the battery starts discharging on its own, even without use. The phone hangs frequently, and its speed is extremely slow, just like a basic phone. Investing money in this phone means a complete financial loss. The seller does not provide any resolutions; instead of a replacement, they appoint a technician who contacts you after the warranty period is over. Then, without a physical visit, they take all the details from you and upload them online on the service portal, marking the service as completed without actually providing any service.  Their service technicians have no idea how to do their job; they start talking rudely and abusively right away. This brand is absolutely not trustworthy. Anyone who buys their product will have to go through the same experience.  After rescheduling the service multiple times, a technician named Vivek Yadav was appointed. His behavior was completely inappropriate; he spoke in a threatening and abusive manner and said, ""Do whatever you want, I will not provide the service visit."" Very bad and worthless experience from Amazon and their Service provider (TROUBLE SHOOTING SERVICES). Please never ever trust product and service provider like this. They all are black spot on humanity.",NEGATIVE
Good smartphones Not for heavy users. Budget 5g phone.,NEGATIVE
Must buy this Phone.,NEGATIVE
Its nyc.. But i think when i charging this device... It will be lightly geting warm..,NEGATIVE
"My ratings 4.45/5⭐  Okay! I'm writing this review after one month of usage. I played BGMI and FF, ran antutu test and cpu throttling too..  Pros:-  1) Gaming:- No doubt that this is the best phone for gaming at this price segment, I played both FF and BGMI on this device, the dimensity 7300 processor runs so smoothly so that you can experience a lag free gaming even in high graphics/resolution. (To experience true 90FPS gaming you need to turn on the GT mode).  2)Performance:- Gaming phones generally do perform well on normal usage too, same here, the processor was good enough and runs smoothly even on multitasking. (Can give a max of 120hz refresh rate). Performance wise no doubt, you will be satisfied!  3)Design and display: The 6.67 inch OLED display was really good and appreciable!  4)Camera:- Although primarily this was not a camera phone but still the picture quality was fine and good, with a 50mp back camera and 16mp front camera (Back camera was better though).  5)Battery:- Battery backup was good, comes with a 45W supervoc UF inbox charger, Takes almost 1 hr 20 mins to charge fully from zero. Can give a full working day backup on normal usage.  6) Sound quality:- Sound quality was fine, The stereo speakers are loud and clear, For calls they've included clear voice(ENC) feature too. (There was no Dolby Atmos BTW, should 've included it! :)  7) Comfort in hand: Trust me, this mobile is really comfortable in hand while holding and gaming. You don't feel any slipperiness.  Cons:-  1) The main problem i personally experienced is 'overheating', like wtf man it goes till 42.5°C while charging and 41°C while gaming at a room temperature of 30 degrees!!  2) Too much bloatware from the app market (although you can clear it).  3) build quality/looks:- The built quality can be improved, both frame and back comes with a plastic material and No Gorrila glass too:)  4) Should also have included NFC tap to pay or Gorrila glass as most phone's at this price are providing any one of them.  5) Antutu scores: When I ran antutu test, it scored nearly 670k (BTW they've said 750k)👎🏻. Although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).  Final verdict: This phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. If you prefer good camera and build quality/design this might not be a better choice for you!!  This phone worked well for me!! I advice you to check other reviews too:)",POSITIVE
Ultimate phone in this price range (Rs 14498). Screen and performance is very good. And green colour is also attractive colour. Only cons is camera is ok ok but not bed. Battery backup is good and fast charging takes approx 1hr for full charge. And realme UI is awesome and friendly. I am using this phone since a week.,POSITIVE
"The REALME Narzo 70 Turbo is hands down the best budget gaming phone under ₹20K! It's an absolute beast, packing the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Energy chipset, which is usually found in phones priced well above ₹30K. Gaming and multitasking feel seamless, and it delivers top-notch performance.  The OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate is a delight to use, providing smooth visuals and vibrant colors. Storage isn't a problem either, thanks to the UFS 3.1 technology, which ensures blazing-fast read and write speeds.  Battery life is impressive, with a 5000mAh capacity, and the 45W SuperVOOC charger in the box ensures you’re back to full power in no time. While the camera is decent, the focus here is clearly on performance, which it nails perfectly.  To top it off, REALME offers 2 years of Android updates (up to Android 17) and 3 years of security updates, ensuring long-term usability.  For gamers or anyone looking for a performance-centric device at this price, the Narzo 70 Turbo is a no-brainer. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
Review after a week of usage 1) Build Quality is good 2) Battery life is good as I have good screen on time and some times gaming also 3) No heating issue. 4) charging speed is good as 45 watts is enough compare to 100 watts as you will hardly save 15 min in all. 5) Not hanged in 7days 6) software is decent plan and simple 7) looks are subjective but I like the looks.,POSITIVE
The mobile is very light weight. The camera quality is very good. We can play games in 90+fps with an awesome amoled display. Charging speed is high Sound quality in this budget is decent Touch functionality is too smooth and can see the power of 120hz refresh rate Overall the mobile is worth to buy,POSITIVE
"Good Display and handy size device. Fast charging is good 45w and 45mins-1hr can charge it fully. Average battery- Same budget 1+ Nord CE 4lite will have 30% extra charge than this. Low Call sound, in crowd area we can't hear the opponent voice. Too many unnecessary apps from Realme. It taken 2hrs to clear that and set the phone. Speakers are good for multimedia. Decent for a normal daily use. Not a Very Good device. When I order this mobile, Amazon shows 1 free earbuds (N1) from Realme. But later they twisted it and said, No such offers for me.",NEGATIVE
Amazing performance in gaming as well as in photography under such a good price .ui,POSITIVE

"Here are my genuine experience after using this phone since 2-3 days. # What's are good in this phone: >Battery is Ok Ok (it's 4G phone, obviously consumes less power). >Dual stereo speakers, sounds well during multimedia plays.  # What's are bad in this phone: >Software is not up to the mark. Not even for daily uses apps. Apps take reloading just only 2 min of inactivity. >Island punch hole is just for hike in the market. Not for any use. >Not given some useful functions like double tap to on/off. Given only some limited functions. >Camera platform is not looking good. >Over whole phone is very very laggy. You will literally irritated after just using 10 min of use.  Final review: If you have budget below 7k, there are a lot of options in the market in this price range. Don't trust on the YouTube's review.",NEGATIVE

"The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is a new entry in the competitive mid-range smartphone market. Known for delivering good value for money, Realme’s Narzo series often balances features and affordability well. With a focus on performance, display quality, and connectivity, the Narzo 70x 5G aims to attract users looking for a capable device without breaking the bank. In this review, we will delve into its key aspects, including design, display, performance, camera quality, battery life, and connectivity.  **Design and Build Quality**  The Realme Narzo 70x 5G comes in a striking Forest Green color that gives it a premium look. The design is modern and sleek, with a clean finish that is visually appealing. The device features a plastic back and frame, which is standard for its price range, but it is well-built and feels sturdy in hand. The phone is lightweight and ergonomically designed, making it comfortable for prolonged use.  The front of the phone is dominated by a 6.5-inch display with slim bezels, and the rear houses a triple camera setup housed within a rectangular module. While the design is not particularly groundbreaking, it is functional and attractive for a mid-range device.  **Display**  One of the standout features of the Narzo 70x 5G is its 120Hz Ultra Smooth Display. This high refresh rate ensures smoother animations, improved responsiveness, and an overall more fluid visual experience. For users who enjoy gaming or frequently scroll through content, this feature can significantly enhance usability.  The display itself is a 6.5-inch IPS LCD panel with Full HD+ resolution. It offers vibrant colors and decent brightness levels, making it suitable for most indoor and outdoor conditions. While it may not match the brightness and contrast ratios of high-end OLED panels, it is more than adequate for daily tasks, media consumption, and casual gaming.  **Performance**  Under the hood, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ chipset. This 6nm processor is designed to handle 5G connectivity and deliver a smooth performance for mid-range devices. Coupled with 8GB of RAM, the phone manages multitasking with ease, and app launches are swift.  In everyday use, the Narzo 70x 5G performs well, handling tasks such as web browsing, social media, and video streaming without significant hiccups. For gaming, the device is capable of running popular titles at medium to high settings, though demanding games might require reduced graphics settings for optimal performance.  The inclusion of 128GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, media, and files. For users who need more storage, the Narzo 70x also supports expandable storage via a microSD card slot, which adds flexibility for managing large files.  **Camera Performance**  The Realme Narzo 70x 5G features a triple camera setup on the rear, consisting of a 50MP primary sensor, a 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. The main 50MP camera performs well in various lighting conditions, capturing sharp and detailed images. The AI enhancements help in optimizing colors and improving photo quality, making the camera versatile for different shooting scenarios.  The macro lens is useful for close-up shots, though it can sometimes struggle with focus and detail in low light. The depth sensor aids in creating bokeh effects for portrait shots, and while it works effectively, the results may not be as refined as those from higher-end devices.  On the front, the Narzo 70x 5G sports a 16MP selfie camera that delivers good quality selfies. The camera app includes various modes and filters to enhance the user experience, and it performs admirably for social media and video calls.  **Battery Life**  The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is equipped with a 5000mAh battery, which is a generous capacity for a mid-range phone. Combined with the efficient Dimensity 6100+ processor and the 120Hz display, the battery life is commendable. Users can expect a full day of moderate to heavy use, including web browsing, media consumption, and occasional gaming.  The phone also comes with a 45W fast charger in the box, which is a significant advantage. The fast charging feature allows the device to quickly regain power, minimizing downtime and ensuring that users can get back to using their phone without extended waits.  **Connectivity and Software**  As the name suggests, the Narzo 70x 5G supports 5G connectivity, providing future-proofing for users looking to take advantage of the latest network technology. The device also includes other connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.1, and GPS.  On the software front, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G runs on Realme UI, based on Android. The interface is user-friendly and includes various customization options, enhancing the overall user experience. However, the phone does come with some pre-installed bloatware, which may not be necessary for all users.  **Positive Aspects**  1. **High Refresh Rate Display**: The 120Hz Ultra Smooth Display enhances the overall visual experience, providing fluid animations and smoother interactions. 2. **Solid Performance**: The Dimensity 6100+ chipset, combined with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth performance for everyday tasks and moderate gaming. 3. **Good Battery Life**: The 5000mAh battery, along with 45W fast charging, offers long-lasting usage and quick recharging. 4. **Expandable Storage**: The option to expand storage via microSD adds flexibility for managing files and media. 5. **Attractive Design**: The Forest Green color and sleek design give the phone a premium feel, despite its plastic construction.  **Negative Aspects**  1. **Average Display Quality**: While the 120Hz refresh rate is a highlight, the display’s overall quality is typical for an IPS LCD and may not match the vibrant contrast of OLED screens. 2. **Camera Performance**: While the 50MP main camera is competent, the additional sensors (macro and depth) may not provide significant improvements and can struggle in low light conditions. 3. **Bloatware**: The pre-installed apps on Realme UI might not be useful for all users and can clutter the interface. 4. **Plastic Build**: The use of plastic for the back and frame, while common in this price range, might not feel as premium as glass or metal alternatives.  **Conclusion**  The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is a well-rounded smartphone that offers a range of features catering to the mid-range market segment. Its 120Hz display, solid performance, and good battery life make it a competitive option. However, some limitations in display quality, camera performance, and bloatware should be considered. For users seeking a balance of performance and value, the Narzo 70x 5G is a strong contender, though it may not meet the needs of those looking for a high-end experience.",POSITIVE
"This phone is worth of the price it offers, has a good camera, sturdy build, nice looks, also tye RAM and ROM combination is also good, Chipset is of low caliber as compare to others but works smoothly. Battery is a plus point 6000mah comes with 45W fast charger Oh and for music lovers you can connect wired earphones also which is getting rare now in new phones Weight wise it's lightweight in hand Feel premium in hand Camera is very good It's 5g in this price range with nice memory, Battery backup, performance and so Overall it's a good buy if you are looking for a mid range 5g smartphones with good camera and battery.",POSITIVE
"I liked it much and the phone is worth It. I bought it 3 months ago and cost me 12K. The phone size is big enough and phone quality is okay. The phone doesn't got heated up till now and Battery is superb. The phone charging us super fast, get's charged full in less than an Hour and lasts up to 1 day in full charge. I liked it in this price. But the brightness accomodation is not good. The performance is good and smooth and also no phone hanging issue faced till now. Overall a nice phone to buy.",POSITIVE
"The realme narzo 70 x 5g is a great mid ranged smartphone with a good camera, well equipped with a 5000 mah battery. The box comes equipped with a charger, a phone case and a phone? I guess. Though the phone is not best suited for gaming. The processor is not that great. And the display is not something I prefer either. The phone is best suited for non gaming activities. Have to gift a phone to your parents? Need a phone for work? The realme narzo 70 x 5g is a great phone at a good price.",POSITIVE
"The Realme Narzo 70x 5G has a lot going for it—on paper, it looks like a fantastic deal. The 6GB RAM and 128GB storage combo handles everyday tasks and multitasking like a champ. Powered by the Dimensity 6100+ 6nm processor, the phone feels fast and responsive, even with demanding apps. Plus, 5G support ensures you're set for the future.  The 120Hz refresh rate promises smooth visuals, but here's the catch: the display itself is disappointing. Colors look dull, brightness isn't great, and the viewing angles leave a lot to be desired. Watching videos or gaming on this phone just doesn’t feel as immersive as it should, which is a shame considering its other strong features.  That said, the 50MP AI camera is a highlight, taking clear and detailed photos in good lighting. Another big plus is the 45W charger included in the box, which charges the phone super quickly—a lifesaver when you're on the go.  What I Liked: Strong performance thanks to Dimensity 6100+ Reliable 50MP camera for casual photography 5G-ready, keeping you future-proof Fast charging with the 45W charger  What I Didn't Like: The display is a letdown (dull colors, low brightness, poor viewing angles)  Overall, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G does a lot of things right, but the subpar display holds it back from being a great all-rounder. If you don’t mind compromising on display quality, this phone offers good value for money.",NEGATIVE
Mobile looks very elegant. Speed is good. Battery lasts long and fast charging as mentioned in product description. Delivered on time.. Camera quality is good. Great product,POSITIVE
"Got this phone on last day of sale with additional 3K coupan.Here is my candid feedback.  Pros: 1. Clean Operating system... No lag. My other phone is iphone13 and believe me the touch and navigation is like iOS. 2. Camera superb with 50x zoom. This is a killer. Front camera is quite OK. 3. Best battery backup... 5200mah does last for a day for medium usage. 4. Fast charging supported... 0 to 50percent in few minutes and to 100% also fast(sorry was not patient enough to exactly time it :) 5. Yes no charger... But similar mobiles with charger have poor performance (based on YT reviews) so phone is still value for money without charger. No offense to ppl who are complaining :) 6. Many people don't recognise this brand... I was a Honor8pro user so experienced the brand value. 7. Provides private space dual login. Great feature to separate work and personal logins with one phone. 8. Light weight and sleek design with curved display. 9. Good volume with dual speaker at top and bottom of phone. 10. Capsule feature near camera notch like iPhone. 11. Screen guard comes pre installed and back cover (transparent) comes in the box.  Cons: 1. I personally wanted white color, but for some reason it's priced 3K INR more that black. I guess due to demand & supply. 2. Brought separate charger with super charging... And I am not complaining due to above 'pros' :)",POSITIVE
"Excellent display,Light weight, no lag, excellent camera. You will be impressed with camera detailing(Main Camera). Potrait mode is so good. Ui animations and working are looking like apple ios. In-hand feel is so good, compact and lightweight. I have got this for around 18k with offers and exchange.  Many of the issues fixed with updates.  Many people don't know the worth of honor product in the past i have used honor8pro that device lasted me almost 7 years 2018-2024 oct.  Updates :comes with Android 14 and also it's 2 years not 2 versions as of now in my POV & research Google released Android 15 in Q2 2025 it will release Android 16. So, hope we will get 3 major version updates.  Gaming : I did causual gaming payback2, Rc20, etc runs smooth with no lags or frame drops at all with almost negligible heating compared to other phones. Only con : NO CHARGER and 100 watt charger is priced at 3000 and if we want to take take 35 watt charger but is out of stock every time. At present I am using Google's 30 watt charger and it is working fine and charges it pretty fast around 45-55 minutes. Edit :- Got 35 watt honor Charger from honor store, no heating issue, charges quickly. Trust me I don't think you can get the better deal in this price range. It's an overall package.",POSITIVE
"Been Using the Mighty Honor 200 from the Past 10 days & I am spellbound by the Performance of the phone , awestruck with the Photos captured . The Visuals of the Display are vivid & an eye feast to watch videos. The Best part is the camera of the phone ( 50MP Portrait + 50MP Telephoto lens + 12MP Wide & 50MP Selfie camera ) . The best camera setup in the price segment. What I love the most is the Honor has collaborated with Studio Harcourt renewed for capturing Portraits of Hollywood Stars & Celebrities. They together brought 3 stunning filters to capture studio level portraits. I have shared a few pictures captured using the Harcourt filters. The output is stunningly marvelous. Posting them directly. No filters added & no colour correction done. Most importantly we don't have any photography skills. It's all the magic of the Camera & Harcourt Filters. If you are looking for the Phone to capture best Portraits , Honor200 is Undoubtedly the best choice. The Telephoto lens is outstanding . you could capture crisp photos even in 50X Zoom. The last 4 pictures , I have attached are captured from the same spot ( Ultrawide , 1X , 10X & 50X Zoom ) You could see the names of the boards captured clearly in 50X zoom. Coming to the selfie camera , you could capture beautiful selfies with 50MP selfie camera. you could record 4K videos using both Rear & Front camera . Dula video recording , slow motion video recording , Time lapse , Solo cut are the other camera options you could found. In Camera Department , Honor 200 is the complete package. Apart from the camera Yu can have the Honor Eye comfort Display with 3840Hz PWM Dimming for utmost eye care. Silicon -Carbob Battery with 5200mAh with 100W Wired charging . The UI is so smooth with Magic OS 8.0. The best part with Magic OS is , it pefectly synchronizes with the Hardware of the phone & you will never faces any issue with performance. I have been using Honor20 from the past 5 years & it still working like a charm , not even once I faced an issue like phone lagging . Thanks to Magic OS. There are so many Ai features that could make your life so easier with daily tasks. . I am not a Hardcore gamer . You could smoothly play games & the Graphics are loading good in BGMI. I haven't played for long hours to check the performance while gaming.  Positives ----------- 1) camera 2) Display 3) Charging 4) Beautiful Design 5) Magic OS  Cons ------ Charger could have Included in the Box",POSITIVE

Cons:-  1) The main problem i personally experienced is 'overheating', like wtf man it goes till 42.5°C while charging and 41°C while gaming at a room temperature of 30 degrees!!  2) Too much bloatware from the app market (although you can clear it).  3) build quality/looks:- The built quality can be improved, both frame and back comes with a plastic material and No Gorrila glass too:)  4) Should also have included NFC tap to pay or Gorrila glass as most phone's at this price are providing any one of them.  5) Antutu scores: When I ran antutu test, it scored nearly 670k (BTW they've said 750k)👎🏻. Although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).  Final verdict: This phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. If you prefer good camera and build quality/design this might not be a better choice for you!!  This phone worked well for me!! I advice you to check other reviews too:)",POSITIVE
Ultimate phone in this price range (Rs 14498). Screen and performance is very good. And green colour is also attractive colour. Only cons is camera is ok ok but not bed. Battery backup is good and fast charging takes approx 1hr for full charge. And realme UI is awesome and friendly. I am using this phone since a week.,POSITIVE
"The REALME Narzo 70 Turbo is hands down the best budget gaming phone under ₹20K! It's an absolute beast, packing the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Energy chipset, which is usually found in phones priced well above ₹30K. Gaming and multitasking feel seamless, and it delivers top-notch performance.  The OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate is a delight to use, providing smooth visuals and vibrant colors. Storage isn't a problem either, thanks to the UFS 3.1 technology, which ensures blazing-fast read and write speeds.  Battery life is impressive, with a 5000mAh capacity, and the 45W SuperVOOC charger in the box ensures you’re back to full power in no time. While the camera is decent, the focus here is clearly on performance, which it nails perfectly.  To top it off, REALME offers 2 years of Android updates (up to Android 17) and 3 years of security updates, ensuring long-term usability.  For gamers or anyone looking for a performance-centric device at this price, the Narzo 70 Turbo is a no-brainer. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
Review after a week of usage 1) Build Quality is good 2) Battery life is good as I have good screen on time and some times gaming also 3) No heating issue. 4) charging speed is good as 45 watts is enough compare to 100 watts as you will hardly save 15 min in all. 5) Not hanged in 7days 6) software is decent plan and simple 7) looks are subjective but I like the looks.,POSITIVE
The mobile is very light weight. The camera quality is very good. We can play games in 90+fps with an awesome amoled display. Charging speed is high Sound quality in this budget is decent Touch functionality is too smooth and can see the power of 120hz refresh rate Overall the mobile is worth to buy,POSITIVE
"Good Display and handy size device. Fast charging is good 45w and 45mins-1hr can charge it fully. Average battery- Same budget 1+ Nord CE 4lite will have 30% extra charge than this. Low Call sound, in crowd area we can't hear the opponent voice. Too many unnecessary apps from Realme. It taken 2hrs to clear that and set the phone. Speakers are good for multimedia. Decent for a normal daily use. Not a Very Good device. When I order this mobile, Amazon shows 1 free earbuds (N1) from Realme. But later they twisted it and said, No such offers for me.",NEGATIVE
Amazing performance in gaming as well as in photography under such a good price .ui,POSITIVE

"I purchased Apple 16 128GB on 16/Jan/2025 started using it from 17/Jan battery is draining even though its idle, authorized service center also confirmed and they gave a service record letter (after lot of conversation the representative hardly agreed to upload the document he is really not suitable to continue in the position) i uploaded the report to amazon, when i choose for replacement Amazon says they need another letter from Authorized service center, as expected they Apple never gave any denied report to anyone, now i don't have option to either replace and cancel.  Amazon customer care is really not helpful, better don't buy any products from amazon website offers by attracted, they will send a defective /refurbished/re-used devices..  Amazon you loss the trust and belief of a valued customer who paid 80,000/- on a product  My sincere suggestion to those who want buy any apple product better visit the store and purchase from there.",NEGATIVE
Excellent product from Apple,POSITIVE
The best feature of iPhone is that it does not hang even after many years of use. This one is super fast and easy to use,POSITIVE
"Now it has been more than 2 months since I purchase and I have no complain about it. And I think it the best phone I ever purchased at this price range it provides almost all the features like camera, light gaming, a big battery which go through all the day , and many other features and functions. It functions smooth all the task without any hang problems. In one one it is a all-rounder phone . You can go for it without any hesitation. And it better than any other phone at this range.",POSITIVE
"First impressions: 1. While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding. 2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings. 3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them. 4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run. 5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge. 6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say. 7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant. 8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.  Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.  Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.  Update after 2+ weeks of usage: 1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive. 2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges. 3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.",NEGATIVE
"Bought this for office sim as a secondary mobile with op12 as primary.I generally use this mobile for office calls and little youtube and browsing here and there. With moderate usage it lasts two days easily.  Forgot that this phone has a camera and if your priority is a secondary phone which lasts longer with decent processor, go ahead and purchase.  No hanging, no heating, not heavy and super fast finger print reader. Display quality is okish",POSITIVE
"Value for money product Camera, Display, Battery, Performance, Features, Dual Speaker Sound Quality, Everything is impressive under this price segment.",POSITIVE
"Good product with no lagging, low weight Look and design is good. Good functionality. Good value in budget.",POSITIVE
"Battery is good, lasts 2 days. Disappointed with camera, picture quality is average. Overall good for daily usage. I don't play games on phone . Software is buggy. Sometimes some functions don't work. Don't expect much from this phone. My earlier phone Samsung F23 was much better than this. Regret selling F23 for this phone..",NEGATIVE

"like the camera quality, value for money, style, and mobile performance of the cell phone. They mention it has a nice design, excellent 5G speed, and a big long-lasting battery.

"Buying the TECNO POVA 6 NEO for ₹13,999 feels like a waste, especially with the misleading claims about the AI camera. The phone only supports 16 AI-generated photos and doesn’t offer 4K video recording. It has a 108MP rear camera, but no additional lenses, limiting its ability to take different types of photos. The front camera pictures also lose quality when zoomed in, which isn’t great.  On top of that, the phone doesn’t have Gorilla Glass or any other protective screen, making it easy to scratch. Even though it has a 5000mAh battery, it doesn’t last a full day, and the 18W charging is slow, with noticeable heating issues when charging.  The camera doesn’t perform well in low light, so night photography is disappointing. The phone also heats up during gaming, which affects its performance. Without Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), videos aren’t very stable, especially when moving or shooting handheld.  The 6.67-inch LCD screen, with a resolution of 1600x720 pixels (HD+), is below average, and it doesn’t look as clear as other phones in this price range. Even though TECNO claims the phone has a 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling through apps like YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook feels laggy after using it for a while.  TECNO also advertises a 12-month OTTPlay subscription with a scratch code included in the box, but the code doesn’t work after just a month, which is frustrating.  The phone has dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, but the sound during WhatsApp video calls or on loudspeaker isn’t as loud as expected. For the price, this kind of quality just isn’t good enough.",NEGATIVE
"At this price this phone offers a lot of useful features. 1. Phone design and display is excellent. Phone looks like a premium flagship model. 2. Battery can easily last for around 2 days with normal day to day usage. 3. Many intersting and useful AI features at this price range. 4. It has got many smart features which feels really good and amazing like dynamic port , smart panel, AI wallpaper, AI text board 5. Massive storage and memory 6. Screen size is good and big 7. Sound is loud with top and bottom speakers 8. Rear camera is good takes good pictures but front camera is average. 9. No ultrawide features available. 10. Camera has few new features like vlog, sky shop, AI generator , AI eraser, stickers, dual video, portrait video which are amazing and useful. Overall this phone offers a wide range of features and is a good buy at this price range.",POSITIVE
"Fluent performance,but charger and cable quality is not good seems cheap but device overall feels good and camera is also good with good battery life",POSITIVE
"This is one value for money product. Resolution is not good but have every other features at this price. Do not expect extraordinary at this price point. Have 256 gb storage, NFC, AI enabled, Decent camera, This is a good budget buy.",POSITIVE
"Though cost wise phone is good but some of the key features not working well or low quality 1) Display auto brightness is not as effective as it's in other mobile like MI phone. 2) Speaker quality is not good 3) Call recording there are no much options if I need to selec only few contacts to record. Quality of recording is horrible...it's echoing and my voice is high and other end voice is low. 4) Finger print or biometric touch is not so great especially when u set to unlock the screen after pressing power button 5) Display and touch I can say ok. 6) While u r on WhatsApp video call and when u receive regular, WhatsApp app hangs and closes itself. U need to restart the WhatsApp video call again",NEGATIVE

"The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is a new entry in the competitive mid-range smartphone market. Known for delivering good value for money, Realme’s Narzo series often balances features and affordability well. With a focus on performance, display quality, and connectivity, the Narzo 70x 5G aims to attract users looking for a capable device without breaking the bank. In this review, we will delve into its key aspects, including design, display, performance, camera quality, battery life, and connectivity.  **Design and Build Quality**  The Realme Narzo 70x 5G comes in a striking Forest Green color that gives it a premium look. The design is modern and sleek, with a clean finish that is visually appealing. The device features a plastic back and frame, which is standard for its price range, but it is well-built and feels sturdy in hand. The phone is lightweight and ergonomically designed, making it comfortable for prolonged use.  The front of the phone is dominated by a 6.5-inch display with slim bezels, and the rear houses a triple camera setup housed within a rectangular module. While the design is not particularly groundbreaking, it is functional and attractive for a mid-range device.  **Display**  One of the standout features of the Narzo 70x 5G is its 120Hz Ultra Smooth Display. This high refresh rate ensures smoother animations, improved responsiveness, and an overall more fluid visual experience. For users who enjoy gaming or frequently scroll through content, this feature can significantly enhance usability.  The display itself is a 6.5-inch IPS LCD panel with Full HD+ resolution. It offers vibrant colors and decent brightness levels, making it suitable for most indoor and outdoor conditions. While it may not match the brightness and contrast ratios of high-end OLED panels, it is more than adequate for daily tasks, media consumption, and casual gaming.  **Performance**  Under the hood, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ chipset. This 6nm processor is designed to handle 5G connectivity and deliver a smooth performance for mid-range devices. Coupled with 8GB of RAM, the phone manages multitasking with ease, and app launches are swift.  In everyday use, the Narzo 70x 5G performs well, handling tasks such as web browsing, social media, and video streaming without significant hiccups. For gaming, the device is capable of running popular titles at medium to high settings, though demanding games might require reduced graphics settings for optimal performance.  The inclusion of 128GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, media, and files. For users who need more storage, the Narzo 70x also supports expandable storage via a microSD card slot, which adds flexibility for managing large files.  **Camera Performance**  The Realme Narzo 70x 5G features a triple camera setup on the rear, consisting of a 50MP primary sensor, a 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. The main 50MP camera performs well in various lighting conditions, capturing sharp and detailed images. The AI enhancements help in optimizing colors and improving photo quality, making the camera versatile for different shooting scenarios.  The macro lens is useful for close-up shots, though it can sometimes struggle with focus and detail in low light. The depth sensor aids in creating bokeh effects for portrait shots, and while it works effectively, the results may not be as refined as those from higher-end devices.  On the front, the Narzo 70x 5G sports a 16MP selfie camera that delivers good quality selfies. The camera app includes various modes and filters to enhance the user experience, and it performs admirably for social media and video calls.  **Battery Life**  The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is equipped with a 5000mAh battery, which is a generous capacity for a mid-range phone. Combined with the efficient Dimensity 6100+ processor and the 120Hz display, the battery life is commendable. Users can expect a full day of moderate to heavy use, including web browsing, media consumption, and occasional gaming.  The phone also comes with a 45W fast charger in the box, which is a significant advantage. The fast charging feature allows the device to quickly regain power, minimizing downtime and ensuring that users can get back to using their phone without extended waits.  **Connectivity and Software**  As the name suggests, the Narzo 70x 5G supports 5G connectivity, providing future-proofing for users looking to take advantage of the latest network technology. The device also includes other connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.1, and GPS.  On the software front, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G runs on Realme UI, based on Android. The interface is user-friendly and includes various customization options, enhancing the overall user experience. However, the phone does come with some pre-installed bloatware, which may not be necessary for all users.  **Positive Aspects**  1. **High Refresh Rate Display**: The 120Hz Ultra Smooth Display enhances the overall visual experience, providing fluid animations and smoother interactions. 2. **Solid Performance**: The Dimensity 6100+ chipset, combined with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth performance for everyday tasks and moderate gaming. 3. **Good Battery Life**: The 5000mAh battery, along with 45W fast charging, offers long-lasting usage and quick recharging. 4. **Expandable Storage**: The option to expand storage via microSD adds flexibility for managing files and media. 5. **Attractive Design**: The Forest Green color and sleek design give the phone a premium feel, despite its plastic construction.  **Negative Aspects**  1. **Average Display Quality**: While the 120Hz refresh rate is a highlight, the display’s overall quality is typical for an IPS LCD and may not match the vibrant contrast of OLED screens. 2. **Camera Performance**: While the 50MP main camera is competent, the additional sensors (macro and depth) may not provide significant improvements and can struggle in low light conditions. 3. **Bloatware**: The pre-installed apps on Realme UI might not be useful for all users and can clutter the interface. 4. **Plastic Build**: The use of plastic for the back and frame, while common in this price range, might not feel as premium as glass or metal alternatives.  **Conclusion**  The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is a well-rounded smartphone that offers a range of features catering to the mid-range market segment. Its 120Hz display, solid performance, and good battery life make it a competitive option. However, some limitations in display quality, camera performance, and bloatware should be considered. For users seeking a balance of performance and value, the Narzo 70x 5G is a strong contender, though it may not meet the needs of those looking for a high-end experience.",POSITIVE
"This phone is worth of the price it offers, has a good camera, sturdy build, nice looks, also tye RAM and ROM combination is also good, Chipset is of low caliber as compare to others but works smoothly. Battery is a plus point 6000mah comes with 45W fast charger Oh and for music lovers you can connect wired earphones also which is getting rare now in new phones Weight wise it's lightweight in hand Feel premium in hand Camera is very good It's 5g in this price range with nice memory, Battery backup, performance and so Overall it's a good buy if you are looking for a mid range 5g smartphones with good camera and battery.",POSITIVE
"I liked it much and the phone is worth It. I bought it 3 months ago and cost me 12K. The phone size is big enough and phone quality is okay. The phone doesn't got heated up till now and Battery is superb. The phone charging us super fast, get's charged full in less than an Hour and lasts up to 1 day in full charge. I liked it in this price. But the brightness accomodation is not good. The performance is good and smooth and also no phone hanging issue faced till now. Overall a nice phone to buy.",POSITIVE
"The realme narzo 70 x 5g is a great mid ranged smartphone with a good camera, well equipped with a 5000 mah battery. The box comes equipped with a charger, a phone case and a phone? I guess. Though the phone is not best suited for gaming. The processor is not that great. And the display is not something I prefer either. The phone is best suited for non gaming activities. Have to gift a phone to your parents? Need a phone for work? The realme narzo 70 x 5g is a great phone at a good price.",POSITIVE
"The Realme Narzo 70x 5G has a lot going for it—on paper, it looks like a fantastic deal. The 6GB RAM and 128GB storage combo handles everyday tasks and multitasking like a champ. Powered by the Dimensity 6100+ 6nm processor, the phone feels fast and responsive, even with demanding apps. Plus, 5G support ensures you're set for the future.  The 120Hz refresh rate promises smooth visuals, but here's the catch: the display itself is disappointing. Colors look dull, brightness isn't great, and the viewing angles leave a lot to be desired. Watching videos or gaming on this phone just doesn’t feel as immersive as it should, which is a shame considering its other strong features.  That said, the 50MP AI camera is a highlight, taking clear and detailed photos in good lighting. Another big plus is the 45W charger included in the box, which charges the phone super quickly—a lifesaver when you're on the go.  What I Liked: Strong performance thanks to Dimensity 6100+ Reliable 50MP camera for casual photography 5G-ready, keeping you future-proof Fast charging with the 45W charger  What I Didn't Like: The display is a letdown (dull colors, low brightness, poor viewing angles)  Overall, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G does a lot of things right, but the subpar display holds it back from being a great all-rounder. If you don’t mind compromising on display quality, this phone offers good value for money.",NEGATIVE
Mobile looks very elegant. Speed is good. Battery lasts long and fast charging as mentioned in product description. Delivered on time.. Camera quality is good. Great product,POSITIVE
"Got this phone on last day of sale with additional 3K coupan.Here is my candid feedback.  Pros: 1. Clean Operating system... No lag. My other phone is iphone13 and believe me the touch and navigation is like iOS. 2. Camera superb with 50x zoom. This is a killer. Front camera is quite OK. 3. Best battery backup... 5200mah does last for a day for medium usage. 4. Fast charging supported... 0 to 50percent in few minutes and to 100% also fast(sorry was not patient enough to exactly time it :) 5. Yes no charger... But similar mobiles with charger have poor performance (based on YT reviews) so phone is still value for money without charger. No offense to ppl who are complaining :) 6. Many people don't recognise this brand... I was a Honor8pro user so experienced the brand value. 7. Provides private space dual login. Great feature to separate work and personal logins with one phone. 8. Light weight and sleek design with curved display. 9. Good volume with dual speaker at top and bottom of phone. 10. Capsule feature near camera notch like iPhone. 11. Screen guard comes pre installed and back cover (transparent) comes in the box.  Cons: 1. I personally wanted white color, but for some reason it's priced 3K INR more that black. I guess due to demand & supply. 2. Brought separate charger with super charging... And I am not complaining due to above 'pros' :)",POSITIVE
"Excellent display,Light weight, no lag, excellent camera. You will be impressed with camera detailing(Main Camera). Potrait mode is so good. Ui animations and working are looking like apple ios. In-hand feel is so good, compact and lightweight. I have got this for around 18k with offers and exchange.  Many of the issues fixed with updates.  Many people don't know the worth of honor product in the past i have used honor8pro that device lasted me almost 7 years 2018-2024 oct.  Updates :comes with Android 14 and also it's 2 years not 2 versions as of now in my POV & research Google released Android 15 in Q2 2025 it will release Android 16. So, hope we will get 3 major version updates.  Gaming : I did causual gaming payback2, Rc20, etc runs smooth with no lags or frame drops at all with almost negligible heating compared to other phones. Only con : NO CHARGER and 100 watt charger is priced at 3000 and if we want to take take 35 watt charger but is out of stock every time. At present I am using Google's 30 watt charger and it is working fine and charges it pretty fast around 45-55 minutes. Edit :- Got 35 watt honor Charger from honor store, no heating issue, charges quickly. Trust me I don't think you can get the better deal in this price range. It's an overall package.",POSITIVE
"Been Using the Mighty Honor 200 from the Past 10 days & I am spellbound by the Performance of the phone , awestruck with the Photos captured . The Visuals of the Display are vivid & an eye feast to watch videos. The Best part is the camera of the phone ( 50MP Portrait + 50MP Telephoto lens + 12MP Wide & 50MP Selfie camera ) . The best camera setup in the price segment. What I love the most is the Honor has collaborated with Studio Harcourt renewed for capturing Portraits of Hollywood Stars & Celebrities. They together brought 3 stunning filters to capture studio level portraits. I have shared a few pictures captured using the Harcourt filters. The output is stunningly marvelous. Posting them directly. No filters added & no colour correction done. Most importantly we don't have any photography skills. It's all the magic of the Camera & Harcourt Filters. If you are looking for the Phone to capture best Portraits , Honor200 is Undoubtedly the best choice. The Telephoto lens is outstanding . you could capture crisp photos even in 50X Zoom. The last 4 pictures , I have attached are captured from the same spot ( Ultrawide , 1X , 10X & 50X Zoom ) You could see the names of the boards captured clearly in 50X zoom. Coming to the selfie camera , you could capture beautiful selfies with 50MP selfie camera. you could record 4K videos using both Rear & Front camera . Dula video recording , slow motion video recording , Time lapse , Solo cut are the other camera options you could found. In Camera Department , Honor 200 is the complete package. Apart from the camera Yu can have the Honor Eye comfort Display with 3840Hz PWM Dimming for utmost eye care. Silicon -Carbob Battery with 5200mAh with 100W Wired charging . The UI is so smooth with Magic OS 8.0. The best part with Magic OS is , it pefectly synchronizes with the Hardware of the phone & you will never faces any issue with performance. I have been using Honor20 from the past 5 years & it still working like a charm , not even once I faced an issue like phone lagging . Thanks to Magic OS. There are so many Ai features that could make your life so easier with daily tasks. . I am not a Hardcore gamer . You could smoothly play games & the Graphics are loading good in BGMI. I haven't played for long hours to check the performance while gaming.  Positives ----------- 1) camera 2) Display 3) Charging 4) Beautiful Design 5) Magic OS  Cons ------ Charger could have Included in the Box",POSITIVE
"My ratings 4.45/5⭐  Okay! I'm writing this review after one month of usage. I played BGMI and FF, ran antutu test and cpu throttling too..  Pros:-  1) Gaming:- No doubt that this is the best phone for gaming at this price segment, I played both FF and BGMI on this device, the dimensity 7300 processor runs so smoothly so that you can experience a lag free gaming even in high graphics/resolution. (To experience true 90FPS gaming you need to turn on the GT mode).  2)Performance:- Gaming phones generally do perform well on normal usage too, same here, the processor was good enough and runs smoothly even on multitasking. (Can give a max of 120hz refresh rate). Performance wise no doubt, you will be satisfied!  3)Design and display: The 6.67 inch OLED display was really good and appreciable!  4)Camera:- Although primarily this was not a camera phone but still the picture quality was fine and good, with a 50mp back camera and 16mp front camera (Back camera was better though).  5)Battery:- Battery backup was good, comes with a 45W supervoc UF inbox charger, Takes almost 1 hr 20 mins to charge fully from zero. Can give a full working day backup on normal usage.  6) Sound quality:- Sound quality was fine, The stereo speakers are loud and clear, For calls they've included clear voice(ENC) feature too. (There was no Dolby Atmos BTW, should 've included it! :)  7) Comfort in hand: Trust me, this mobile is really comfortable in hand while holding and gaming. You don't feel any slipperiness.  Cons:-  1) The main problem i personally experienced is 'overheating', like wtf man it goes till 42.5°C while charging and 41°C while gaming at a room temperature of 30 degrees!!  2) Too much bloatware from the app market (although you can clear it).  3) build quality/looks:- The built quality can be improved, both frame and back comes with a plastic material and No Gorrila glass too:)  4) Should also have included NFC tap to pay or Gorrila glass as most phone's at this price are providing any one of them.  5) Antutu scores: When I ran antutu test, it scored nearly 670k (BTW they've said 750k)👎🏻. Although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).  Final verdict: This phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. If you prefer good camera and build quality/design this might not be a better choice for you!!  This phone worked well for me!! I advice you to check other reviews too:)",POSITIVE
Ultimate phone in this price range (Rs 14498). Screen and performance is very good. And green colour is also attractive colour. Only cons is camera is ok ok but not bed. Battery backup is good and fast charging takes approx 1hr for full charge. And realme UI is awesome and friendly. I am using this phone since a week.,POSITIVE
"The REALME Narzo 70 Turbo is hands down the best budget gaming phone under ₹20K! It's an absolute beast, packing the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Energy chipset, which is usually found in phones priced well above ₹30K. Gaming and multitasking feel seamless, and it delivers top-notch performance.  The OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate is a delight to use, providing smooth visuals and vibrant colors. Storage isn't a problem either, thanks to the UFS 3.1 technology, which ensures blazing-fast read and write speeds.  Battery life is impressive, with a 5000mAh capacity, and the 45W SuperVOOC charger in the box ensures you’re back to full power in no time. While the camera is decent, the focus here is clearly on performance, which it nails perfectly.  To top it off, REALME offers 2 years of Android updates (up to Android 17) and 3 years of security updates, ensuring long-term usability.  For gamers or anyone looking for a performance-centric device at this price, the Narzo 70 Turbo is a no-brainer. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
Review after a week of usage 1) Build Quality is good 2) Battery life is good as I have good screen on time and some times gaming also 3) No heating issue. 4) charging speed is good as 45 watts is enough compare to 100 watts as you will hardly save 15 min in all. 5) Not hanged in 7days 6) software is decent plan and simple 7) looks are subjective but I like the looks.,POSITIVE
The mobile is very light weight. The camera quality is very good. We can play games in 90+fps with an awesome amoled display. Charging speed is high Sound quality in this budget is decent Touch functionality is too smooth and can see the power of 120hz refresh rate Overall the mobile is worth to buy,POSITIVE
"Good Display and handy size device. Fast charging is good 45w and 45mins-1hr can charge it fully. Average battery- Same budget 1+ Nord CE 4lite will have 30% extra charge than this. Low Call sound, in crowd area we can't hear the opponent voice. Too many unnecessary apps from Realme. It taken 2hrs to clear that and set the phone. Speakers are good for multimedia. Decent for a normal daily use. Not a Very Good device. When I order this mobile, Amazon shows 1 free earbuds (N1) from Realme. But later they twisted it and said, No such offers for me.",NEGATIVE
Amazing performance in gaming as well as in photography under such a good price .ui,POSITIVE
"My ratings 4.45/5⭐  Okay! I'm writing this review after one month of usage. I played BGMI and FF, ran antutu test and cpu throttling too..  Pros:-  1) Gaming:- No doubt that this is the best phone for gaming at this price segment, I played both FF and BGMI on this device, the dimensity 7300 processor runs so smoothly so that you can experience a lag free gaming even in high graphics/resolution. (To experience true 90FPS gaming you need to turn on the GT mode).  2)Performance:- Gaming phones generally do perform well on normal usage too, same here, the processor was good enough and runs smoothly even on multitasking. (Can give a max of 120hz refresh rate). Performance wise no doubt, you will be satisfied!  3)Design and display: The 6.67 inch OLED display was really good and appreciable!  4)Camera:- Although primarily this was not a camera phone but still the picture quality was fine and good, with a 50mp back camera and 16mp front camera (Back camera was better though).  5)Battery:- Battery backup was good, comes with a 45W supervoc UF inbox charger, Takes almost 1 hr 20 mins to charge fully from zero. Can give a full working day backup on normal usage.  6) Sound quality:- Sound quality was fine, The stereo speakers are loud and clear, For calls they've included clear voice(ENC) feature too. (There was no Dolby Atmos BTW, should 've included it! :)  7) Comfort in hand: Trust me, this mobile is really comfortable in hand while holding and gaming. You don't feel any slipperiness.  Cons:-  1) The main problem i personally experienced is 'overheating', like wtf man it goes till 42.5°C while charging and 41°C while gaming at a room temperature of 30 degrees!!  2) Too much bloatware from the app market (although you can clear it).  3) build quality/looks:- The built quality can be improved, both frame and back comes with a plastic material and No Gorrila glass too:)  4) Should also have included NFC tap to pay or Gorrila glass as most phone's at this price are providing any one of them.  5) Antutu scores: When I ran antutu test, it scored nearly 670k (BTW they've said 750k)👎🏻. Although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).  Final verdict: This phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. If you prefer good camera and build quality/design this might not be a better choice for you!!  This phone worked well for me!! I advice you to check other reviews too:)",POSITIVE
Ultimate phone in this price range (Rs 14498). Screen and performance is very good. And green colour is also attractive colour. Only cons is camera is ok ok but not bed. Battery backup is good and fast charging takes approx 1hr for full charge. And realme UI is awesome and friendly. I am using this phone since a week.,POSITIVE

"Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.  Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.  Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.  If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.  I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.  They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.  Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.  For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: - Great battery backup. With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone. - Camera quality at this price is way above average. - Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point. - One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations. - No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer. - Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.  Cons: - Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g. - Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated. - Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage. - There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates. - Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector. So, need to shell out extra money for these.",NEGATIVE
"Good budget phone. If you are looking for a decent phone from a trusted brand go for it . Good built quality, decent camera , clean UI . Also for people looking for a secondary android phone can go for this one .  Cons : No charger , no back cover comes with the box  Just to highlight : I am not a gamer and use mainly social media and streams apps . If you are gamer please go for a different device.",POSITIVE
"Literally best product for those who avoid chinese products like me.  Display: SAmoled 120hz with victus+ protection Speaker sound: Dual loud with excellent bass quality Build: Solid build Software: One ui 7 (coming soon) Battery: 6000 Mah Camera: 50Mp OIS Os updates: 4 years Android updates Samsung customer service is top notch  This samsung M35 has satisfied my needs more than what i expected  My previous phone was Samsung M31, this M35 is significantly improved compared to M31  My suggestion: Buy extended warrenty, enable dolby atmos, use finelock to customize nextlevel  Thanks for your time",POSITIVE
"Good design, battery backup, customised UI, display, performance.  Camera is just okay.  Device weight is heavy. Which is complicate to handle.",NEGATIVE
The mobile is coming with a factory loaded login pin. This prevented me from loading Apps and start working. I have to visit a Samsung Authorised Service Center to remove the login pin. This has casued a lot of mental agony and inconvenience.,NEGATIVE
"The Samsung Galaxy M35 is a solid all-rounder, offering best-in-class display quality and reliable performance in the budget segment. Whether you’re a casual user or a basic gamer(not for pro), this phone has you covered. If you're looking for a device that punches above its weight without breaking the bank, the Galaxy M35 should be at the top of your list in budget.  Stunning Display Quality Best performance Great battery life",POSITIVE
It is pretty fast and great for the price.,POSITIVE
One of the best mobile you can get in this range! The camera quality is good.. It has small display at back which if you have desk job and you listen to songs or see notification or anything.. It is good and action key is my favourite as I can customize as I want. Charging is fast and battery power is also good. Clean android and amazing display also.. Hoping they keep improving with time! No heating issue! In display fingerprint sensor is also amazing. No issue with connectivity 👍,POSITIVE
"The design and feel of this smartphone is incredible with matt glass back and curved screen. The steel metal rails on edges are shiny and look really premium. Great build quality overall.  Camera island gives a nice symmetrical look, also good grip area. The back screen is very useful for using main camera for photo. It also has Always on display option for back display. Could have been more customisable with cutom images/more animations.  Performace is great, no lags, no heat very efficient 4nm tsmc processor with only 2.5 ghz so no problem with battery life. Charging speed is very good 66 watts. It's my first 5g phone and experience is great. No battery issue with 5g very efficient there as well.  Beautiful Amoled screen is smooth, reponsive and vibrant. Brightness is decent. Great software experience. Action button is super useful! What a great addition.  Dual speaker are crisp and very useful. Sarisfied with camera quality, as I'm not a huge camera person, it's difficult to judge for me. OIS helps. Also, good vibration motor.  For cons -  No micro sd. Have to get 256 GB variant because of that. But, storage provided is good quality and fast ufs3.1  The button place is such that I accidently press the opposite button. Volume is opposite to lock and action button. It took some getting used to for me personally.",POSITIVE
"I have been using the phone for the last 3 months. Battery backup is huge, you would not get such powerful battery in anyother phone, Inscreen fingerprint sensor is mind blowing. Performance is great, never faced any issue, does not hand, no lagging - be advised I do not play high graphic hungry games like CODM or any other battle royales. There is absolutely no heating issue. Touch quality is smooth. One crutial thing that Lava needs to work on is the camera. They have provided the wide angle camera which is great but the issue lies in the primary camera. For apparent no reasons the camera would go out of focus and even after trying for many minutes will not correct itself. Another thing is the zoom, as soon as you go above 2x, the quality will go towards bad and light capturing decreases. Apart from these issues, the phone is great. the mini screen in the back is a nice addition.",POSITIVE
"I am proud of this company Lava.Because I was previously using Lava Agni 2. And my family members also have phones from the same company, Lava.Every phone from this company is working in the best possible way. And currently I have bought Lava Agni 3.And currently, while using the Lava Agni 3, every feature of this phone is surprising me. Because this company has made the best phone for such a low price.Lava Agni 3 has the best camera, best processor, best stereo speakers, best display, best battery life, best design and many more.... Best. Best.. Best I love India 🇮🇳 and. I LOVE LAVA #proudly Indian.",POSITIVE
"This is a very good phone with all latest features like curved display, fast processor, big memory size ( i have purchased 8GB/256GB ) 5000 MAH battery, Dual ampled, One year replacement warranty. And the best is it is Make in India. Value for money.",POSITIVE
"Awesome mobile in this range, best decision, but Camera colour are good but not too much good.., battery is 5000mh but not enough because of two display. Fast charging, best quality, I use this mobile from 2 months and no problem I face.",POSITIVE
"Wow.. amazing phone in every aspect.. I have seen many bad reviews about camera on YouTube, but I still bought it by seeing other good qualities. But believe me, the camera is so good both front n back. Super clarity curved display. No other company can give you this much clarity n features at this price. Its worth more than its price. Fast charging. I bet you will be happy buying Lava Agni 3. Proudly Indian smartphone.",POSITIVE
Overall phone experience is good but camera performance is poor . It has problem with camera optimization. You have to take 10 photos then you will get one or two good photos . Otherwise phone is good hepatics soo good .look wise osm. Sound quality is descent. I face No heating issue. Good connectivity . it will give you a primium experience in this price range .,POSITIVE
"I can understand what you might think with the title but trust me, the camera is too good. I call it a camera phone. The images are just so good. The low light capturing is even better than an iPhone. If you like to click good pictures, this is the phone for you which is also in a good budget. Plus, you can game on it all day long. The battery lasts entire day. If I charge it to 100% in the morning 8:00 am, I will have 20-30% left around 8:00 pm. It’s just awesome 😃😃 . The only problem is you might not find a good back cover for this. Don’t know why companies didn’t make good back covers for this phone. It is a bit bulky to carry but at the same time sleek and handy. It’s performance is also in the tops. It is a flagship phone if you use it well. The touch, I felt the touch is even better than a SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 Ultra. Rest is upto you to find out. You won’t regret buying it. I’m enjoying it and I take it everywhere I travel. I have clicked more than thousand pictures with it, including low light. It’s just amazing.",POSITIVE

This is my third handset. I used two different tecno before this. I took this phone in BBD on EMI for six months. Total will around 33k. I love this phone. Camera display and look is best. Everyone talk about look of this bone. Retractable lense makes it unique. It's zoom is 20x which is less than many phones but in terms of clarity tecno x2 p pro at same 20x provide better quality. One interesting thing is we can read text from distance from which we can not read single word with our eyes. It helps me many time in my work. Only thing I think can be improve is when speaker is on during call only bottom speaker works. Insted if this can be both speaker at time.,POSITIVE
"Just received the phone and oh my god it's a freakin masterpiece, kudos to tecno for creating such a beauty. Frankly speaking my main requirement in a phone is its look and feel and boy you won't find such a good looking handset. The Orange colour is very nice and the big camera module just looks so unique and appealing. Talking about specs its a through and through flagship, display is crisp and cameras are very good. Its a little on a heavy side and i like that, when you hold it feels like a ultra premium device. I love the first experience hope it performs well for long time. Go for it, for me it competes with all premium flagships in the market right now, have not tested the battery life and heating issue to the fullest but even if there will be some issues it's worth it for what you have in your hands. Really well built Tecno.",POSITIVE
According couple of problems like finding screen guards for the phone is like very hard for me the couple of very minor problems. The camera quality is excellent I feel it is very good gaming the processor is too good the sound quality is not too good not too bad is good okay the battery life is also good charging is good definitely value for money,POSITIVE

"This is post 3 days of using of phone and simply couldn't resist myself from writing this review. Got the Razor Green 12 GB 512 GB for 32K post Bank discount. Adding some context before diving into my experience. I was an S22 Ultra user and ditched the same for OnePlus 12 SD8G3. I wanted an add on phone for office use and for gaming (BGMI & MKX). Got this one post going through round of comparisons against IQOOs out there. Not I just had one sim in the phone as I was using it. So coming straight to how I rate this phone. It is a 5/5 for me. Looks: 4/5 ✌️✌️✌️✌️ Display: 5/5 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Touch Response: 5/5 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈 Performance: 5/5 ✨✨✨✨✨ Gaming performance: 5/5 👍👍👍👍👍 Speaker Output: 5/5 ( very decent) Battery: 10/5 ( Simply marvellous) Charging speed: 15/5 (no comments) Camera: 4/5 (boosted this up from 3 to 4 based off overall happiness with the phone and considering the price factor) OS: 4/5 (-1 because of few preloaded apps) Finger print scanner: 5/5  So what I loved: Display and performance crisp and buttery smooth. OS is clean too to the most. SD7+G3 takes on any tasks thrown on it with ease. No hassles in multitasking. Got July security patch as of yesterday so all good on that front too. Now speaking about what I'm in love with - Being an S22 Ultra user I must say the biggest pain point has been battery since day 1. Max gaming time 3.5 Hrs. in the initial days which reduced to 1.5 over a span of 2 years. Stand-by was crazy bad too on S22 Ultra. This Lil gizmo GT 6T is a dream in this case. 3 days of game play BGMI 5 Hrs. each day and was left with 22% of juice still remaining each time. And post sleep of 6 hrs. the phone still retained 17% of charge. This already is insane in my perspective. Now coming to the charging aspect, this is unimaginable. Lightning fast... 17% - 100% in 22 minutes. Speechless in this front. Sammy used to take like 1 hr and 10 mins. in the initial days and post an year and half I really don't know. Gaming done without gtmode. Frame rate was set to auto adaptive. BGMI played in Smooth Extreme+. Brightness at ~45%. No throttling or heating. It got slightly warm at a point (really no where close to be called as heating) and then cooled too which is 😍😍😍. WhatsApp, FB, Insta, Gmail, O365, Teams and all other apps on the background. So you can go for this one blindfolded if you are looking for a phone with great backup and performance (gaming performance). I hope this is helpful. What I didn't like: Given all of above a 3.5 mm slot was expected. And sound output in headphones could have been better. I used Sony WH1000XM3 for gaming and Wf1000XM4 for listening to music and watching movie to test the output. Again you can hear all the footsteps and minute details and same applies to music if not all details but covers 90% of it but somewhere lacks the loudness factor by a bit and no Dolby Atmos so less to mention there. Lastly, I didn't cover anything on cam perspective because I was really not looking at this phone from that aspect and me sharing my experience on that front will definitely make no sense as the comparison will be against S22 Ultra here and this reaches no where close to it which is completely fine given it is not even 1/4th of the price for which I had bought S22 Ultra. That said both front and rear cam are decent is all I can say from price point perspective. Overall this is a bang on deal from my perspective and would definitely recommend going for it if you are not cam centric and looking for a great performer!",NEGATIVE
"Great curved screen and elegant design, amazing performance! Good for BGMI game to play @90fps(tested) without any lag by enabling GT mode🤩🥳  Cameras are big and entire back looks very premium but, the brand provided case is of no use because of its big space to showcase the cameras entire area😤 it looks awkward with that case on🤮 I recommend The GiftKart liquid silicon back case(black) which costed me 299/- its a good case that provides utmost security and also proper grip, it gives a premium look and feel for the mobile by covering all the unnecessary gaps..  I am glad that I have availed the discount coupon of 7k that was available for some period on amazon and bought the mobile for ₹23,998/- and I am super happy🥳😍 Great sound and screen, the cameras also amazing and captures best shots📸🏞️  I have used all brands from Nokia to Apple. My majority mobiles was of Nokia, LG, Samsung, Motorola and Apple 5S.. Then One+ 3t, iPhone Xr and now from last 2 years with iPhone 12.  I have bought Mi max, Vivo, Poco X3, Realme GT Neo 3 and Motorola g54 mobiles for my wife so far to play PUBG/BGMI often with my kids as well and now bought this Realme GT 6t🥳😁..  I have used lots of mobile phones and now I can say this is the best, one can get under 31k price tag! If you get it lower than that, you’re damn lucky🥳😍😎🕺🏻…  Note: The design, looks and colours are depends on individual tastes but, the mobile phone is definitely a power packed all rounder🔥🔥🔥",POSITIVE

"I was searching for smartphone for a long time because my old smartphone (2019 bought) becoming aged and getting slowed down, on my research i was impression that either i would go with a lower mid range smartphone or a premium (preferable samsung) smartphone.  So i was not sure that what i have to purchase but my preferences was (in descending order) Battery 🔋+ charging speed Performance (upgrade from SD855) Storage Screen brightness (out visibility must be good) 5G bands atleast 10 (most usable) UI (software, atleast acceptable)  Overall if these check boxes are ticked ✅ (rest things comes complimentary).  So this query bring me the following smartphones at similar prices. 1. POCO F6 12/512 2. Realme GT 6T 8/256 3. OnePlus Nord 4 8/128  However Poco is powerful among these with FLAT SCREEN but we all know why many avoid poco, so left with two options Realme or OnePlus then again OnePlus green line mass problem forced me to think twice and decided to go with Realme GT 6T with curved screen (with the thought that if i disliked it even slightly, I'll sell it within days).  So Waited for BBD/Geart indian festival SALES Keeping all phones on list because if prices get's uneven (due to massive discount) then preferences will again change.  The day arrived got hige discount on POCO but till then i had made my mind to go with Realme (overall good software with everything balanced and compromising on Screen because it's a curved screen).  Ordered this RELAME GT 6T 8/256GB variant (Green looks sober, classy and not too shiny)  Then new fear unlock seeing Delivery frauds (some accuses seller, some accuses delivery partner and so on) researched about this. And was waiting for delivery with All the guns (safety measures) loaded.  Parcel arrived Talked with delivery guy, told him the seller/delivery frauds, he was a really nice guy, listened carefully and helped me to check ✅ parcel thoroughly after inspection we concluded that parcel (high security packaging) is TEMPERED, is strongly recommended me to cancel because it is high-value package so don't take risk  We proceeded with cancellation provided OTP for cancellation, order cancelled successfully. Within seconds he realises that package we looking was different and we cancelled my package, i was like (abbey, Harmonium) oh brother. Then i asked to check my parcel packaging and to my surprise that too was tempered (high security packaging considered tempered with when white line don't appear clearly or turns color PINK/GREEN with clearly visible side numbers) so i was relaxed that it's okay  But i had second thought and asked him to see if he can still deliver my package, he was looking to try to deliver package even after cancellation, he tried to send otp for delivery but no luck because OTP not received (tried multiple times),  I lost the hope and about ti leave the spot then he told me to wait, he called to warehouse operator asked him if he can mark this cancelled package as delivered, he said YES, within seconds he marked order delivered and package handover to me. Then i realised OTP thing also caused due to network, so Turned on flight ✈️ mode on then off, just afte that recieved 5 OTP messages. Told him this, he said no problem backend delievery system don't need OTP,  I Left the spot, thinking that i have made a big (costly) mistake, because Amazon don't offer open box delivery and often deny Returns (service centre replacement policy).  Reached into room, placed package on table, turned on Camera, inspected everything on camera. I was too nervous to open the box.  Just started to open and when i seen phone box with security seal and plastic sheet over the box (some relief).  Carefully open phone box and took BEAST into my Hand 👌🏽👌🏽, That look was amazing 🤩 Everything sorted.  💥🌟💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨✨💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨ DEVICE-REVIEW-HERE DEVICE-REVIEW-HERE  Review part: • Battery [9hrs with 5G always on with auto Refresh Rate and with mixed Wi-Fi+5G usage 12+hrs]🔋+charging (I'm not going back to slow charging again ever) • Performance is really beast (more than expected) • Screen brightness 🔅 SUPER AMAZING • UI (after removing and disabling bloats) amazing • Speaker and camera also good (but low light camera performance is not good)  Overall I'm with this beast for next few years (maybe 5yrs) if everything went as usual.  Build quality is plastic and finger prints are visible if Cover or skin not applied.  However i still feel if this had FLAT screen it would be blind suggestion for everyone (normal/casual user).  Call quality is excellent, Google dialer comes default but can be changed to Odialer for call recording.  I felt if someone who use multiple apps (more than 10 except calls/sms/email/Play Store) for daily usage, needs to tweak battery settings for every single app to achieve optimal battery backup else would face battery drain issues (faced this but that was once in a month kind thing).  Overall no battery drain or charging issues, no issues with calls (I'm using jio). Day light video/photography is better.  Overall a BEAST I bought 8/256 @ 26k (with card discount). Please vote up 👍🏽 if you find it helpful.  Thanks",NEGATIVE

"Really very good phone. Very good Camera quality, software, performance, build quality, display & superb battery life 😍😍😍",POSITIVE
Don’t buy from amazon they give you defective phone and the return policy is also fake as they don’t let you return or replace the product. Even in the given time period,NEGATIVE
"Nice , mind blowing and phone",POSITIVE
"Excellent phone, Apple Intelligence is amazing, the battery life is mind blowing and comes with the best camera. If you have a 13 Pro Max or older, go for it. If you have a 14 Pro Max, the only difference you are going to see is Apple Intelligence, better battery life and slightly better cameras. Otherwise it's going to feel like the exact same phone if you use it without a case as the rounded eges in 16 Pro Max are better to use without cases. Skip and save money if you have the 15 Pro Max because the difference is negligible. The black titanium color looks gorgeous and the only good color in the current series. It's a shame they removed the Blue Titanium color. Also costs 15-20k less than the launch price of 15 Pro Max so that is a huge plus.",NEGATIVE
"I did not like it at first. Its my first iPhone. I have used Samsung, Oneplus and Xiaomi phones. 16 Pro Max has many flaws. Android is much better now. But iOS is very smooth.  Things I liked: 1. Speakers are amazing. 2. Battery life is good. 3. Overall smoothness. 4. Camera is great.  Things I did not like: 1. All the Web Browsers (Safari or others) are limited to 60hz. 2. No option for menu bar navigation (android has both gestures and bar). 3. Display / Screen color is fixed at Natural tone (no option for Vivid etc). 4. Restricted files/folder access and many other UI limitations. 5. Managing Whatsapp media is a mess (its much simpler on android). 6. Telephoto 5X images are too soft. 7. No separate Camera folder in Photos app for the photos you take with your phone.",NEGATIVE
Very expensive. Better if. Ur upgrading after a couple of years. Best video cameras on a smartphone bt apple should come out with something innovative or change their design. This looks very similiar to previous products. Great camera. Top notch in every department.,POSITIVE
High performance Long lasting Best quality Best security Just Apple thing.,POSITIVE

"I purchased Apple 16 128GB on 16/Jan/2025 started using it from 17/Jan battery is draining even though its idle, authorized service center also confirmed and they gave a service record letter (after lot of conversation the representative hardly agreed to upload the document he is really not suitable to continue in the position) i uploaded the report to amazon, when i choose for replacement Amazon says they need another letter from Authorized service center, as expected they Apple never gave any denied report to anyone, now i don't have option to either replace and cancel.  Amazon customer care is really not helpful, better don't buy any products from amazon website offers by attracted, they will send a defective /refurbished/re-used devices..  Amazon you loss the trust and belief of a valued customer who paid 80,000/- on a product  My sincere suggestion to those who want buy any apple product better visit the store and purchase from there.",NEGATIVE
Excellent product from Apple,POSITIVE
The best feature of iPhone is that it does not hang even after many years of use. This one is super fast and easy to use,POSITIVE
Display is awesome... Battery backup to notch. It support call recording. Stunning photos which can you see above. Build quality is best... Ultra smooth disply.. Camera quality best it can take stunning photos. Only cons us that there is no youtuber to talk positive about LAVA BRAND. LAVA has capability to make absolutely best smartphones. This is my real review and i donot get any rupee for this....,POSITIVE
"It's been 7 days since I started using it. In this 1 week my experience with Lava Blaze 5G was more bad than good. Although it wasn't worse as some might think. So, let's start the review from where it needs to be.  Delivery and Unboxing- The package I received was really the worst in my entire life. There was only the amazon cardboard box but that's it. It was very wore out, loose and completely opened from one side. On top of that there was no foam, bubble wrap or thermocol sheet at all to protect from accidental shocks or any damage. At first impression it felt like my package has been tampered but thankfully that's not the case. I would request amazon to improve their packaging and I would like to ask about why their packaging quality got degraded over the years. I didn't pay 12k rupees to just receive whatever garbage you can give me. It was an entire months hard earned money. When I started unboxing it everything was there safe and sound. Now I took a sigh of relief. What made me more happy was after setting up the phone I saw the battery was 56%. Every phone I bought till now used to have 49% or below. This is the first ever phone that gives 56% out of the box. Even more exciting thing was this phone gives clean Android with no bloatware and limited features too. But let me inform you that this is not Stock Android. It just uses Google apps and doesn't have any mp3 player, video player or even a gallery of it's own. I wonder if they really have to give only Google apps then they could've provided Google Gallery. Also Lava is using a custom skin but it was hidden so brilliantly that you can't find it even if you wanted to. The customization features of Blaze 5G proved that.  Battery and Charging- 2nd thing about this phone that impressed me. After unboxing it I charged it upto 79% only and did normal tasks like watching Amazon prime, using Google, phone calls, SMS, WhatsApp etc and after 43 hours and 31 minute the battery was 14%. I really was shocked to see this. Imagine how much time it would take to fully deplete the battery. Also, what could've happened if I charged the phone to 100%. But let me tell you it's not because of the enormous 5000mAh battery. This great backup is only because of Lava using Mediatek Dimensity 700 and how well they optimised the battery. Also the clean Android plays a huge role too as there are no apps that will suck the battery in background. Additionally, the 720x1600p display is also another reason for it as it will do less processing compared to a Full HD+ display. That's why it will consume less power. But in gaming I will say it's same as any other phone. Battery will deplete faster and it also depends on what games you play. They give you a 12W charger in the box but the Lava Customer Care confirmed me that Blaze 5G supports upto 15W charging. So if you already have a 15W charger in home you can easily fast charge it. The 12W charger takes more than 3 hours for charging 0 to 100%. Using a 15W charger will make it a bit faster. Expect upto 2 hours for fully charging with a 15W charger.  Display- This phone has a 6.52 inch, 720x1600 (HD+) 90Hz IPS LCD panel, 20:9 aspect ratio with ~269ppi. But don't be disappointed by hearing the resolution numbers. I had seen IRL it feels same as any 1080p display. There is no pixelation, no sluggish-ness and picture quality is great. 90Hz refresh rate makes the phone feel very fast too. Also, the display is very clear in direct sunlight outside. In general the phone is somehow having more nits than anyone else. Just decrease your brightness to the lowest and you'll see that Blaze 5G is still bright than other phones of any price you say. Now this was oddly satisfying to me.  CPU and Performance- This phone uses a Mediatek Dimensity 700, 6GB RAM and Mali-G57 MC2 GPU. I has been gaming on this phone since the day I received it and it really impressed me in gaming. I play Eversoul, Brawl Stars, T3 Arena, Asphalt 9, The 7 Deadly Sins Grand Cross, Sword Art Online: Integral Factor and Tasokare Hotel. Eversoul, Asphalt 9 and T3 Arena are actually heavy games and will make your phone heat in no time. They do lag on budget phones and perform badly. But playing these games on Blaze 5G was wonderful. They run really very smooth and have no lags, jitters or any frame drops at all and I play entire day but the temps of this phone never reached 40°. It reached maximum 36°-37° till now. I really loved how Lava worked on the thermals and it doesn't warm at all and always stays at room temps. Let me tell you that just opening Eversoul makes my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G overheat like crazy. It takes only 1-2 minute to get 58.9°. Yes, I switched to Lava Blaze 5G from a 37k S20 FE 5G and that too because of overheating, thermal throttling and even though S20 FE 5G is equipped with a Snapdragon 865 but it still lags while gaming. Some games has started crashing recently too on it. Thankfully Blaze 5G doesn't have any issues and is very stable. I really loved Blaze 5G giving the option of virtual memory too. But let me tell you that virtual memory is only useful for devices under 4GB of RAM. It won't be any helpful for 6GB and above RAM so I had disabled it after first boot. On top of that you will lose a chunk of your storage unnecessarily. I will suggest everyone to use your Blaze 5G with virtual memory disabled. The memory management in this phone has been another impressive thing. If you minimize the apps or games and open it after 30 minutes, it will resume from where you left and didn't reload. Where my more expensive S20 FE 5G sometimes reloads the apps and games.  Audio- This phone gave me mixed feelings in the matter of audio. Playing music with YT music will feel something else, playing music with Google Files will make you feel something else and facebook, WhatsApp or YouTube will give another kind of feeling. Sometimes it can sound hollow, sometimes it will sound suppress but sometimes it will sound great. It depends on what app you're using and if the music is a mp3 file or you're streaming online. The presence of 3.5mm jack was really impressive too. You can use Bluetooth Neckband, TWS earbuds, 3.5mm earphones and Type-C earphones. I have used pTron Bassbuds Duo, KDM A-2 neckband and Core Type-C earphones. It support it all. A really great thing that you can't get in 200k 300k rupees phone. I really enjoyed the multi support for audio. Otherwise the lack of 3.5mm jack is becoming very normal in budget phones too.  Camera- The photos and videos are exactly what made me hate this phone. This phone comes with Triple Camera AI Setup. Primary one is 50 Megapixels, 2nd module is a 2 Megapixels Macro and 3rd one is not mentioned anywhere but when I asked the Lava Customer Care they told me it is a 0.2 Megapixel VGA module. There is no depth sensor or telephoto lens. A lot of people will dislike this setup but it was good for me as I don't use the telephoto very often. Both the photos and videos are very bad. Sharpness is what a budget phone will give you but there is no HDR, perfect white balance, and while shooting in broad daylight it will overexpose everything. It extremely overexposed my indoor lighting too and I use only 1 CFL bulb for each room. Take this statement as a fact that this camera module will overexpose even a single photon. Let alone broad daylight situation. The colors will be a bit washed out too. I took a photo of my Hero Sprint cycle which is red color but the photo was showing light red/orange-ish color. Software updates of Lava is like non-existent so no idea when we will receive one but these canera issues can be fixed by a software upgrade for sure. But let me tell you that even though Lava advertised Blaze 5G can shoot 2K EIS but that's not the exact matter. You can use EIS in 480p recording too. I have done that and I still don't know if it's a bug or feature but I had shot footages of 480p non-eis, 480p eis, 720p non-eis, 720p eis, 1080p non-eis, 1080p eis, 1440p non-eis and 1440p eis. Glad they didn't lock the EIS function to only 2K. I have attached all the photos so you can take a good look at how both the front and rear camera perform at day and night.  Connectivity- Again it impressed me and this time it was in the matter of connectivity. I have used both of my airtel 5G SIM AND THIS PHONE RUNS DUAL 5G 🤩🤩🤩 I was able to use mobile data from both of these SIM cards and I was getting the expected 5G speed. It also runs dual 4G and dual 3G too. Something that even the extremely high priced phones like Samsung S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 series and 15 series don't provide at all but this Lava 5G did it and it really performs flawlessly. WiFi didn't have any disconnection issues at all and the Bluetooth was able to transfer 4GB of data a little bit faster which I never expected. Lava has played some serious games here with the dual 5G and such capable Bluetooth module. Hotspot didn't face any issues too. Sharing files over both hotspot and Nearby Share was flawlessly fast. Kudos to Lava for providing a connectivity that challenges phones (not so) worth of lakhs.  Final Verdict- So... Should you buy this phone or not? I will say yes and will recommend it but it also depends from person to person. It was very depressing to see that they don't have any service center in Bhubaneswar, Odisha too. Thankfully they compensated this by providing home service so an agent of their will come to your home and will fix everything but if something serious is found, then they'll take the device to service center. Overall this device outstands everything and I have seen a test where Blaze 5G beats S22 Ultra in 5G speed test. So undoubtedly a great device but it is having a huge headroom for improvements.  Thank you and have a nice day 😊",NEGATIVE
"Lava Blaze 5G (Glass Green), Superb design, value for money, good camera, 5000 mAh Battery with day performance, takes around 3 hours to charge",POSITIVE

"I am writing my review for this phone after 2 months from purchase, Lava Blaze 5G is a perfect budget phone with awesome features, the outerbody is slim and sleek and very handy. Battery life is excellent, it can last for 2 days on its 100% charge. Camera quality is OK/good, but don't compare to Samsung Galaxy S22 or iPhone, bcz S22 cost neartly 60k, Lava Blaze 5G offers good quality of camera, anyhow it has camera of 50MP gives nice pictures and videos with low price, and selfi is also in good quality. Network/internet speed is high and It is 5G !!. Gaming perfomance is excellent, there is no hang or delay while using multi applications. Touch response is very quick and easy to use. Overall It worths 12K to purchase and use, Moreover It is origin from India! Give it a try, instead of Oppo, Vivo, Oneplus. It has all features to compete with modern day demands and challenges, like easy for banking transactions, and gaming and creativity.",POSITIVE

"I am rating this phone 5 Star so that my review display at the top of the list and you all could know about the reality of this phone.  This would be a very honest review and I am pretty sure that after reading my review you will get your descision whether you want to buy it or not.  1) Performance :- NOT A HIGH PERFORMANCE PHONE GOOD FOR PERFORMING NORMAL DAILY TASK  2) Gaming :- NOT FOR GAMING I would never recommend to buy this phone for gaming, I played BGMI on this phone and I got very bad experience. Also facing heating issues and drainage of battery quickly.  3) Heating Issue :- Guys this is "" NOT "" a high performance phone. This phone has severe heating issues, if you do some High performance task like watching movie on high resolution or watching YouTube videos on high resolution for a long time, this phone will get heated quickly.  4) Battery Life Issue :- > Guys as I mentioned earlier that this phone has severe heating issues, this decreases the phone's battery life. > If you perform daily normal task on this phone than its battery will last upto 1 day and you have to keep in charging every night. > If you do some slight gaming on this phone like I do (BGMI Gameplay), I have to charge this phone 2 times a day, which is a very frustrating task.  NOTE :- You will not get a charger (Adaptor) with mobile, you have to buy it seperately which will cost 1600-1700 Rupees.  5) Charging :- Guys this phone does not support a fast charging, as it has only 25 watt adaptor. Honestly, It takes 1 hour and 27 minutes for this phone to charge from 0% to 100% . And due to heating issues, you will see decrease in battery life.  6) Camera Quality :- Camera Quality is Good 👍  Overall :-  Camera, Display, Design is GOOD Performance, Battery Life, Heating is Very Bad.  So in short if you want to buy this phone for you parents than it is a very good decision as they need this phone only for performing daily normal task.  If you are a student who also want to do some gaming and want a high performance phone in the same price range then I would prefer "" ONEPLUS NORD 4 "" . OnePlus Nord 4 is a very good phone in compare to Samsung A35 in the same price range.  I would highly prefer ONEPLUS NORD 4.  This Samsung Galaxy A35 is just a 3 Star Average Phone good for performing normal task.",NEGATIVE
"Phone quality,sound quality and performance are very good",POSITIVE

A35 5G works well. Design is very good and overall all things are good. Below are the detailed review Pros____ Good screen Good design Good haptic feedback Good speaker with dolby support Support GoodLock Applications works fine.  Cons- Back camera is laggy and average Front camera is laggy and average. Samsung could improve it to 16 MP minimum. Battery discharge is fast. Need to charge 2 times per day. Little heavy Always on display lights very light. Fingerprint is not fast. Exynos 1380. It should be 1480 atleast. No support of galaxy AI Little overpriced,NEGATIVE
"The phone features an attractive design and is lightweight, making it easy to handle. Cameras are great . It supports fast charging exclusively with a Samsung charger (15W or above). The touch experience is smooth and pleasant. For daily use and gaming, performance is commendable, with no noticeable lag. While it can heat up a bit, Samsung's optimization ensures that performance remains stable. Overall, it's a solid option for users looking for reliability and efficiency.",POSITIVE
Heating issue in ideal state of sharing Hotspot Heating issue while charging Heating issue on continuous cam usage Even can't handle 1 mid game under 5 apps in background. Restarting again. Cam footage average Can't worth even it start selling on under 20k,NEGATIVE

"iQOO Z9s Pro - 8/256GB - 25 January 2025. iQOO did not disappoint. This is an amazing gadget to own. Very good camera, both front 16mp and rear 50mp, producing detailed well-balanced photos with very natural colour tones. Snapdragon 7 Gen 3- super powerful for all functionality. Fast and very accurate finger print reading. It has proper curved display. It will be difficult to maintain this. And you'll never find a satisfactory screen guard ever. But that was expected. But the display is aesthetically pleasing. In-hand feel also is just amazing with no sharp edges.  5000+ battery - it last to the second day easily. And 80W power adaptor charges it in around 30 minutes to full.!!!  Under 25000 Rs. its a great value for money device. And iQOO brand, I felt, is very reliable. This is my second iQOO phone.

Yeah! iQOO z9spro 5g is the phone who is looking for a good sleek design and moderate gamers and good battery life with an above average camera . I think the phone design is much better I feels iQOO z7 pro is a good design and overall phone It is an upgrade version of the last gen and in-hand hand feel is awesome and if you want good phone around 25k it's the allrounder than grab it ⭐⭐⭐1/2 it's my rating to these funtouch os may improve further. So thank you Vivo for bringing these phones at these price range.,POSITIVE
"This phone is one of the best options in its segment, offering an exceptional display with vibrant colors and sharp clarity. The camera performance is outstanding, capturing detailed and crisp photos in various lighting conditions. In terms of performance, it handles multitasking and gaming effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for everyday use. While the overall experience is fantastic, I found the speakers to be slightly underwhelming. However, this is a minor drawback in an otherwise excellent device that delivers on almost every front.""",POSITIVE
"I gave it 4 stars. The selfie camera could have been better. The battery is good, the back camera is also good. I am giving a review after using it for 9 days. This mobile is okay for this price.",POSITIVE

I think the phone design is much better I feels iQOO z7 pro is a good design and overall phone It is an upgrade version of the last gen and in-hand hand feel is awesome and if you want good phone around 25k it's the allrounder than grab it ⭐⭐⭐1/2 it's my rating to these funtouch os may improve further. So thank you Vivo for bringing these phones at these price range.,POSITIVE
"This phone is one of the best options in its segment, offering an exceptional display with vibrant colors and sharp clarity. The camera performance is outstanding, capturing detailed and crisp photos in various lighting conditions. In terms of performance, it handles multitasking and gaming effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for everyday use. While the overall experience is fantastic, I found the speakers to be slightly underwhelming. However, this is a minor drawback in an otherwise excellent device that delivers on almost every front.""",POSITIVE
"I gave it 4 stars. The selfie camera could have been better. The battery is good, the back camera is also good. I am giving a review after using it for 9 days. This mobile is okay for this price.",POSITIVE
"OnePlus has outdone itself this time, delivering a smartphone that truly lives up to its legacy as a flagship killer. After using it for a week, here are my ratings:  1. Design: 10/10 The slim, boxy design with a matte black finish feels premium and elegant. The in-hand feel is exceptional.  2. AI: 10/10 Packed with all the latest AI features, it’s both innovative and intuitive.  3. OS: 9/10 The return of OxygenOS is a brilliant move! While there are a few bloatware apps, OxygenOS 15 is lightning-fast and smooth.  4. Camera: 9/10 While not flagship-level, the camera performs impressively, capturing excellent detail in most scenarios.  5. Battery: 10/10 The silicon battery is a game-changer, offering 10-11 hours of screen-on time with moderate use—simply outstanding.  6. Processor: 10/10 The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 delivers optimized, power-efficient performance that feels seamless.  7. Display: 10/10 The display is breathtaking—vivid, sharp, and a delight to use.  Overall, OnePlus 13R is a powerhouse and offers unbeatable value for its price.  Conclusion: The OnePlus 13R is a masterclass in balancing performance, design, and innovation at a competitive price. With its sleek design, cutting-edge AI features, impressive battery life, and smooth performance, it redefines what a flagship killer should be. While the camera isn't quite flagship-level, it holds its own in most scenarios. If you're looking for a phone that offers premium features without breaking the bank, the OnePlus 13R is the one to beat.",POSITIVE
"A powerhouse of performance and style! ✨ The stunning display is captivating, and the camera delivers crisp, vibrant photos. Gaming is smooth as butter, thanks to its blazing-fast processor. Battery life easily lasts all day, and charging is super quick. Definitely a top contender in its price range!",POSITIVE
"No phone can be rated 5 out of 5. At the best 4.5 would be possible with something or the other falling short.. Oneplus 13R has many great things under it's hood but half heartedly done to retain the difference between R and the non R phone.  A. Positives.  1. Display. Excellent and flat display. No concerns as it now comes with life time warranty for green line issues, if any and if at all which is a great peace of mind considering Oneplus would honour it. Supports Dolby vision, HDR +. The display is bright, clear and crisp. The under display optical finger print sensor is placed lower closer to the bottom bezel failing to the ergonomic placement. It could have been an inch above. However, no issues with it's operations. Quite quick but not as fast and quick as ultra sonic sensor. 2. Processor. Excellent. No lags and no hiccups. (I am not into gaming but i know this would fare well based on my experience with S24 Ultra. Note that there would be heating felt upon prolonged heavy app use. However, this SoC would serve well for several years with new android updates. Now with Oneplus offering 4 plus 6 years SW update policy this is future proof hardware. 3. Sound. Ok, the stereo sound is decent and loud enough but there's evident distortion over 90 percent volume setting. Bass isn't very evident. Also Dolby Atmos is now not available. Otherwise it's a proper stereo sounding speakers. 4. RAM, Storage and Communication. Excellent specs with DDR5 and UFS 4.0. With base version starting at 12GB/256GB it's more than enough for most users. It is however let down with USB 2.0 post that limits transfer speeds but then it's something that wouldn't bother to most people who wouldn't be transferring data to and fro from other devices. IP protection is IP65 which is fine but IP 68 is a common thing at these prices especially from chinese phone makers. Haptics are tight but weak. A little more stronger motor would have been perfect. 5. Battery. Excellent. Anything between 7 to 10 hours of SOT can easily be had from this phone. A proper full day battery unless you are into gaming all the day. I use 50 percent for my use case which involves social media, few camera photos and browsing with about 4 hours of SOT. Calling drains faster than multimedia watching which probably needs to be rectified with future updates. Some carrier bands seems to have been removed, however I didn't have any issues with calling or internet on my 4G airtel SIM. There's no wireless charging though. 6. Call quality Very good and clear. No issues at either end..signal reception is also good.  B. Negatives. 1. Software This is Color OS 15 which is slightly modified as Oxygen OS 15. It's super smooth and slick with lots of customizations possible. But still it's no where near Samsung One UI which is far superior, functional and feature rich than Oxygen OS 15. Also Oneplus added few bloatwares like Phone manager, Phone pick and few other apps. Luckily, you can either uninstall them or disable them. Interestingly, as an example the biggest overlooked setting is you can chose when to enter Power saving mode but you can come out of it only when you charge it till 90 percent. This is something that's silly and Oneplus must automatically disable power saving mode once the battery crosses it's trigger point. There are couple of such thoughtless things in Oxygen OS 15 which should be rectified. There's also nothing like Routines which Samsung offers on their S and A series for phone automation tasks. 2. Cameras Some changes are positive but half hearted. Something like adding a telephoto 2X instead of macro which is such a welcome move, but then this lens has no OIS. UW 8 MP is just passable in daylight. In day light both main and 2X give good quality photos however low light performance is much to be desired. 3X with OIS would be more practical as such. Video on this phone is even more compromised with 4K limited to main sensor. All other sensors are capped at 1080P. In the front 16 MP camera is again okish for photos and handicapped for videos capped at 1080, 30 FPS which is a bummer. Overall Oneplus could have done better with the cameras but it seems like they intentionally subdued R series more to differentiate it with the pricier Oneplus 13 rather than on pricing front. 3. AI There are few AI features in photos, notes etc..but frankly they don't work as seamlessly or effectively as what can be seen on my S24U from Samsung. Oneplus has a long way to go in this aspect. Right now it's more gimmicky.  My last Oneplus phone was 3T post which I switched to Samsung S series. No doubt S series, especially Ultra is leagues ahead both hardware and software but when it comes to value for money Oneplus 13 series does shine. Moreso with their introductory pricing and offers. Yes some of the above shortcomings could have been included at this price point, but stills it's a safe bet and a promising phone for years of use with the kind of hardware and SW you get from Oneplus. I would recommend the Oneplus 13R phone under 40K for its hardware and revised SW update policy.",NEGATIVE
"Now it has been more than 2 months since I purchase and I have no complain about it. And I think it the best phone I ever purchased at this price range it provides almost all the features like camera, light gaming, a big battery which go through all the day , and many other features and functions. It functions smooth all the task without any hang problems. In one one it is a all-rounder phone . You can go for it without any hesitation. And it better than any other phone at this range.",POSITIVE
"First impressions: 1. While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding. 2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings. 3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them. 4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run. 5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge. 6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say. 7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant. 8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.  Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.  Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.  Update after 2+ weeks of usage: 1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive. 2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges. 3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.",NEGATIVE
"Bought this for office sim as a secondary mobile with op12 as primary.I generally use this mobile for office calls and little youtube and browsing here and there. With moderate usage it lasts two days easily.  Forgot that this phone has a camera and if your priority is a secondary phone which lasts longer with decent processor, go ahead and purchase.  No hanging, no heating, not heavy and super fast finger print reader. Display quality is okish",POSITIVE
"Value for money product Camera, Display, Battery, Performance, Features, Dual Speaker Sound Quality, Everything is impressive under this price segment.",POSITIVE
"Good product with no lagging, low weight Look and design is good. Good functionality. Good value in budget.",POSITIVE
"Battery is good, lasts 2 days. Disappointed with camera, picture quality is average. Overall good for daily usage. I don't play games on phone . Software is buggy. Sometimes some functions don't work. Don't expect much from this phone. My earlier phone Samsung F23 was much better than this. Regret selling F23 for this phone..",NEGATIVE
Best mobile at affordable price must buy. Working smooth. Bgmi game is lag free. The screen size and weight is good to hold. With nice colour accuracy. Your gaming experience increases. Must buy product for you and your loved ones.,POSITIVE

"Design One of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.  Display The iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.  Performance The iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.  Camera The iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.  Battery life The iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge. Overall The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.  Pros New design with rounded edges More powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 pro New 48-megapixel main camera Brighter display with upto 2000 nits brightness USB C can be used for anything Dynamic Island  Cons No 120hz display No Macro photography",POSITIVE
Good and improved device with latest features sound quality is awesome,POSITIVE
Good Quality and future but some options disadvantage in android it's available but iOS not available 😑,NEGATIVE
"Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of use  Pros - Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants - Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here - Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless - Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA - Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome - Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me. - The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone - Apples approach on Security! - Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless  Cons - The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm - I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases  Industry memes - USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much - Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!! - Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one? - 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting  Tips of managing battery health - Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh - Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up - I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging - Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20% - Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service - Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section - I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc - My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending above  Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.  ….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience",POSITIVE

Don’t buy from amazon they give you defective phone and the return policy is also fake as they don’t let you return or replace the product. Even in the given time period,NEGATIVE
"Nice , mind blowing and phone",POSITIVE
"Excellent phone, Apple Intelligence is amazing, the battery life is mind blowing and comes with the best camera. If you have a 13 Pro Max or older, go for it. If you have a 14 Pro Max, the only difference you are going to see is Apple Intelligence, better battery life and slightly better cameras. Otherwise it's going to feel like the exact same phone if you use it without a case as the rounded eges in 16 Pro Max are better to use without cases. Skip and save money if you have the 15 Pro Max because the difference is negligible. The black titanium color looks gorgeous and the only good color in the current series. It's a shame they removed the Blue Titanium color. Also costs 15-20k less than the launch price of 15 Pro Max so that is a huge plus.",NEGATIVE
"I did not like it at first. Its my first iPhone. I have used Samsung, Oneplus and Xiaomi phones. 16 Pro Max has many flaws. Android is much better now. But iOS is very smooth.  Things I liked: 1. Speakers are amazing. 2. Battery life is good. 3. Overall smoothness. 4. Camera is great.  Things I did not like: 1. All the Web Browsers (Safari or others) are limited to 60hz. 2. No option for menu bar navigation (android has both gestures and bar). 3. Display / Screen color is fixed at Natural tone (no option for Vivid etc). 4. Restricted files/folder access and many other UI limitations. 5. Managing Whatsapp media is a mess (its much simpler on android). 6. Telephoto 5X images are too soft. 7. No separate Camera folder in Photos app for the photos you take with your phone.",NEGATIVE
Very expensive. Better if. Ur upgrading after a couple of years. Best video cameras on a smartphone bt apple should come out with something innovative or change their design. This looks very similiar to previous products. Great camera. Top notch in every department.,POSITIVE

"Initially I got a defective product, which was not charging at all even after keeping on charge for 5 hours. I spoke with Amazon representative regarding the issue and they were quick enough to issue a replacement unit. I was skeptical about the replacement unit as well based on the already mentioned reviews but I am quite happy after receiving the new unit. I bought this for my mother, she was using the older jio phone. It's display was almost not visible and charging status was not showing. This felt like a good upgrade as I saw some reviews on YouTube mentioning this doesn't lag much like earlier phones. So I bought this and feels it is worth. Although its price seems a Lil over 300-800 more but I think from what it's offering, if you use all those features then it is a good deal, Although my mother uses the phone mostly to call and now to video call sometimes. Battery is pretty good for such usage and it lasted almost 3 days with minimal to moderate usage which is very good. I watched youtube videos, live match in jio cinema, played some music in Jio Saavn and also that wireless radio feature is a very good addition, there isn't much lag considering its size and form factor, I liked the video plaback quality and sound, it is good enough. Saw so much of negative reviews for this one, may be some products are defective like the first one which I received but felt this doesn't deserve that. That's why wrote this longgg review!",POSITIVE
Jio phone is average.not value for money because it has no option for updates what's app as well as its speaker is not working very well while attending call,NEGATIVE
"This is a very good Phone. Before this I bought JioBharat Phone which is waste and now I have purchased this Phone.  Registering JioPay was like a breeze. On the first attempt I am able to register my accounts. Making UPI at all the times was quick & easy and never failed.  To my surprise it has WiFi & GPS also. If needed you can download Google Maps and works perfectly. It gives very nostalgia feeling. People are surprised to see making UPI payments in a feature phone.  WhatsApp is not working and it says need an update. Battery drains fast and I mean it stands for a day. and not more than that. Hope any future software update from Jio could rectify this issue. Better to keep WiFi, GPS & Bluetooth OFF always to save Battery power as we do in Smart Phones.  Will any if any in the coming days.",NEGATIVE
"The JioPhone Prima 2 4G Keypad Phone is a game-changer in the world of feature phones, bringing a perfect balance of modern functionality and simplicity. Here's why it deserves a glowing review:  1. Sleek and Premium Design The Prima 2 features a stylish and compact design that feels premium in hand. Its keypad layout is user-friendly, making texting and navigation effortless, even for those transitioning from basic phones.  2. Feature-Rich Functionality Despite being a keypad phone, it doesn't skimp on features. The inclusion of YouTube, JioTV, JioCinema, and JioSaavn transforms it into a mini entertainment hub. Whether you're catching up on your favorite shows, streaming movies, or enjoying music, the experience is smooth and enjoyable.  3. Connectivity and Productivity The phone supports 4G connectivity, ensuring fast browsing and seamless video streaming. JioPay (UPI) integration is a standout feature, allowing users to manage payments on the go, which is particularly useful for those new to digital transactions.  4. Communication Features The Prima 2 excels in communication. Video calling over 4G is a remarkable addition for a keypad phone, offering crystal-clear conversations. Additionally, the built-in LED torch is practical and a thoughtful touch for everyday use.  5. Digital Camera and Utility Equipped with digital cameras, the phone lets you capture memories on the go. While it’s not a replacement for high-end smartphones, it serves its purpose for casual snapshots.  6. Exclusively for Jio Network The phone is locked to the Jio network, ensuring seamless compatibility with Jio’s suite of apps and services. While this may be a limitation for some, it's an advantage for Jio users who can maximize the value of their subscription.  7. Value for Money Considering the features packed into this device, it’s a tremendous value for money. It’s perfect for those who want the reliability of a feature phone with the perks of modern connectivity and entertainment.

"Lava makes OEM phones for the global market and is one of the largest exporters. But it does not have the jazz of the other leading brands and you may not be able to flaunt this phone if you need a status symbol. But for the tech savvy, this is a great phone worth double it's offer price. So I say it's a silent campaign aiming to sell a quality phone to a quality conscious user. With Android 14, the software brings even greater value to the user.",POSITIVE
Lava O3 pro is a good choice under Rs.7000/- stock Android with out unnecessary apps. I am very much impressed with its display because even under sun light also display is visible. Next one is camera - both captures good pics. I think better in this price point. Battery also gives u one day easily for normal tasks.

"Excellent mobile phone at affordable price. Configuration is very high. Battery is fabulous, charges phone in just 27 minutes from 2% to 100%. Rest all is good. Must buy product if you want to buy new one right now.",POSITIVE
"After using this phone for a month, I can say it's a great choice, especially for the price. The first thing I noticed was the weight—it feels surprisingly light despite housing a large 5500 mAh battery, which is impressive for long-lasting power without adding bulk. The phone is slim, comfortable to hold, and fits well in the hand, making it ideal for daily use.  The camera quality is good for standard photos but has limitations. While it handles basic shots decently, the wide-angle video quality falls short, and there’s no 60 fps option in 4K, which could be a drawback for those who love detailed video work. Additionally, I noticed the camera app tends to lag or even get stuck after taking multiple portrait-mode shots, which disrupts the experience a bit.  Overall, it's a solid budget option with good design, reasonable performance, and decent battery life, though the camera could use a few software improvements for smoother functionality.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus Nord CE 4 is arguably the best phone in the under-25k price range. It features a massive 5500mAh battery, and the 100W fast charging is a significant plus. The battery easily lasts 7-8 hours with regular use, including apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and YouTube. The speakers are loud and crisp, delivering an excellent audio experience. OxygenOS 15 is buttery smooth, adding to the overall premium feel of the device.  Overall, I absolutely love this phone!",POSITIVE
"Really like the build quality, Camera, Sound and performance. Somehow I am expecting much from picture quality but it is okay. As the performance is wonderful.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus Nord CE 4 in Celadon Marble is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a balance of style and performance at a reasonable price. The Celadon Marble color gives the phone a premium, unique look that stands out, and it feels great in hand with its sleek, lightweight design.  With 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the phone handles multitasking smoothly, even with multiple apps running. The performance is snappy and responsive, thanks to its optimized processor and OxygenOS, which offers a clean, intuitive user experience. The battery life is impressive, lasting through a full day of moderate use, and fast charging is a real convenience.  The camera quality is solid for this price range, delivering",POSITIVE
"I've been using this phone for about a week now and I feel that it's super awesome. Let's talk about the pros and cons : Pros 1. The display is pretty bright and amazing. It can play HDR videos upto 1440p in YouTube and you can set your device to brighten up while playing HDR videos in the setting. 2. The UI is very smooth. It has a lot of features too! 3. The cameras are awesome! They click such amazing photos and shoot amazing videos. It clicks natural photos. There are modes like timelapse,slow-mo,etc too. It has OIS, which only records at 1080p 60fps. There is a mode in the video section named 'ultra steady' by which you can use OIS. 4. The performance of the phone is amazing and is well optimised! 5. The built is quality is nice too! 6. The charging is fabulous! It has a 100 watt charger in the box which can full charge your phone in 25 minutes when smart rapid charging is on. The battery backup is just amazing. This phone gives a whopping 1.5-2 days of battery backup. 7. There is a feature that you might not know, you can adjust the intensity of brightness of the torch by pressing and holding the torch symbol, just like iphones. 8. The speakers are loud AF! After updating there is this mode where you could ultra boost volume upto 300% which is crazy! And it's very-very loud.  Cons 1. It can't play 2160p in HDR. 2. It doesn't support OIS on 4k 30fps and the OIS video has very slight unnoticeable jitterness. 3. The animation is kinda slow but smooth for me, so I changed it in developer options. 4. The frame and back is made up of plastic.  The phone is pretty awesome and the cons don't bother me 😄. I'm a tech enthusiast so you can trust on me!",POSITIVE

battery and performance is too good . only camera need little improvement. otherwise phone is good.,POSITIVE
"The phone works perfectly and meets all expectations. It offers smooth performance, long battery life, and excellent camera quality. The display is clear, and the system is stable and fast. A reliable product that I highly recommend. Thank you to the company for the high quality!",POSITIVE
Good,POSITIVE

Value for money, it stands apart, A budget phone with a premium heart. For those who seek both style and speed, The Realme N65 is all you need!",POSITIVE
This is good and value for money but processer is not working good and properly. Many time I see when I pick up call then call pick confirmation is 30 to 40 sec . Another quality say good 👍.,NEGATIVE
"Super Product Good camera, Battery life is good, 6 NM Processor Value for money",POSITIVE
Camera is good Great design Fast fingerprint unlock Better voice Less bezzels screen size is good Best performance this price range,POSITIVE
The phone provides satisfaction for my basic use. The camera is not that great but clicks good pictures in day time. I wanted to use it only for a secondary calling phone and did not want a great phone. So it serves my purpose.,POSITIVE
Video not continuous. So so type camera quality,NEGATIVE
Acha phone h value for money Baki ho skta h aap jb purchase kro tb koi or acha option is price pe aa jaye,NEGATIVE
"Got it for 10.5k with coupen offer. Nice mobile, one small issue is slow charging. Currently the mobile price is 10.2k after I brought, that is a bad thing from amazon",NEGATIVE
"Let me address the main issue that was highlighted by many, that is low sound. I was worried before buying this phone thinking about the same. Must say that sound is not at all an issue. There is one trick to overcome low call ringtone. Yes, default ringtone is low so set the custom ringtone from your memory card. Choose the one that has loud sound. Battery: I think 3 days of battery backup Build Quality: Good but middle button is small, it is hard to click center ok button for a thick thumb guy. Keypad quality is good. Charging: Takes long but no issues since it is keypad you use it mostly for phone call Connectivity: Good and also we can switch off net Display: Can use in outdoor Size: Decent  Summary: Very good for old age person and also for secondary device.",NEGATIVE
"Works as advertised with a lot of ""ifs and buts"". The phone lacks a lot of things primarily dual VoLTE support. Battery life is decent only on a single 4G sim; add another SIM and you'll need to charge it daily. There are a lot of companies that bar their employees from carrying a smartphone for several reasons (read security) this is a perfect one for such niche cases cos this lacks a camera!!!  The OS could have been better, heck the old Symbian 40 series had more to offer! Not many customising options, but it has a way to sync contacts with android which was a nice bonus feature if you ask me.  Thirdly, the old build quality associated with NOKIA is dead let us not beat around the bush and directly HMD Global killed NOKIA's reputation of solid build quality.  If you know you need this phone you know. And you don't have many choices in this category.",NEGATIVE
"This is a bad product with major flaws. The back button on the phone I first ordered was not very responsive, and it needed a hard press to register. So I returned it and got a replacement. The replacement was fine initially, but the same problem appeared after a few days. I have to press hard everytime. It's a design flaw I think.  The software is annoying and gets even the most basic stuff wrong. For example, holding down the hash key doesn't put the phone in silent mode like you would expect, but brings up a menu where you have to manually set the volume to zero. Why even put the silent symbol on the key then?  Another annoyance that many others already mentioned is the red end key which locks the phone, this results in unintentional locks almost everytime. Why even have a home screen if you only get to see it for a few milliseconds before the phone locks itself? And I always have to press buttons multiple times to make sure it registered, not to mention the input lag.  The d-pad is also very badly designed, if you try to press the select button, you are sure to hit one of the directional buttons instead...  Overall, this phone is way overpriced for what it delivers and you would better off avoiding it.",NEGATIVE
"I've recently bought this handset for a second backup device and tried testing different combinations of sim cards together viz. Jio 4G, Airtel 4G & MTNL Dolphin 3G. Works fine with all 3.  NETWORKS: This device supports - 4G(VoLTE)/3G/2G carriers. Can handle Dual 4G VoLTE SIM standby ie. you'll be able to receive calls on both of them, but does not support call-waiting when either of sim is occupied on-call.  PS: For people doubtful about Jio 4G (as I was earlier), this phone is working fine with normal Jio 4G plans - both incoming, outgoing & mobile data.  BATTERY: Good battery life, works fine 4-5 days on single charge (with normal usage like calls & radio)  SOUND: Music Clarity is not very good, but can't expect much from a feature phone, sounds like an old radio. Call Quality through earpiece is also OK (not best) as the incoming voice feels low even at full volume, however on speaker phone it's clear & loud enough.  WORTH: Feels a little overpriced at ₹3249/- could've been better at around ₹2000-2500.",NEGATIVE
Good for normal use as it has 4g,POSITIVE
"Its boon to sr citizens because super radio, bluetooth, calls and clarity. 32gb storage works fine load music and connect ear pod on bluth tooth, reception is too good. Its worth buying.",POSITIVE
"The quality of the voice received on the phone is good. But the phone lacks a camera. Battery life is very poor. Battery has to be recharged frequently even with moderate usage. also the phone lacks Auto call record. The various menus are also difficult to navigate. There are no profiles in the menu such as outdoor, meeting etc. The settings menu has also limited options.",NEGATIVE
"The phone has a very complex and incapable UI which always searches in T9 inside contacts typing box and there's no scope for speed search using keys like in Android and even other feature phones like moto a10. For example, if you want to search for a contact called Manish, 626474 is ll you need to dial straight away from keypad, but this phone sucks in doing that. The default keyboard is T9 even inside contacts which makes searching Indian names a pain. The phone does have useful features such as Oxford dictionary and the best feature being contacts transfer from Android in one go. But all those are wasted because it'll take 5 mins in order for you to search and call someone. Also if you press the power button to quickly get to home screen, it'll turn off the screen and lock the keypad. So frustrating this phone.",NEGATIVE
"Very nice phone, user friendly and easy to use. Very Good battery life. This phone very useful, especially where smart phones are not allowed and aged people who doesn’t like smart phones.",POSITIVE
Great,POSITIVE
Totally bad,NEGATIVE
"Just Go For It Blindly. Fantastic build quality. Clear sound. Long lasting battery around 4-5 days. Sturdy. Good Fit & Finish. Do not think for any other brand keypad phone. Best in class. Don't buy Itel company keypad mobile, not good for long time. It's my personal view. Thanks.",POSITIVE
"Bought this phone for a neighbour. He is 90+ in age. He was using his old nokia feature phone for more than 8 years. Now the battery efficiency has deteriorated and the handset itself had a few cracks, lost a button aswell as the prints on the keys. He asked me to get a new phone but refused a smartphone, wanted a button wala feature phone only, of a good quality and nokia brand only. Got him this one. I have posted a video of the device along with this review with a measuring scale so you get a general idea of the phone's dimensions. Build quality is good, sound quality is good. Uncle ji is very happy with this purchase.",NEGATIVE
Good display and volume Best price 👌 👍 👏,POSITIVE
"I ordered this mobile on yesterday (Nov._12th/2024) & got it today (Nov._13th./2024). Thanks to Amazon for Very fast delivery. Mobile Quality:- it's okay for simple use, sound quality is good.Network connectivity is okay (because some place & ares network Connection is poor). Screen size is okay.

"Just 3 days review with phone: Pros: 1 Light weight with large battery, easily one day backup for heavy use(should put refresh rate at auto, )even with 5 g 2.Good display for media consumption 3.Good main camera- decent night, and potraits pics for the price,super moon mode is cherry on top 4.Fast charging 5.No heating issue while charging or gaming  Cons: 1.Fun touch os, filled with bloatwares, need to uninstall those and turn off all toggles of v app store, 2.Shuld take care of phone like a baby,as display and edge protection is mandatory..if not a display change could cause half of phones price, 3.If u hv obsession for curved display like me then this phone is the value for money for 25k, if not don't go for this (Based on regular software updates ,better performance, less heating issue and service centre availability I considered this over moto edge 50 fusion, but it has gorilla glass protection ,stock android os and vegan leather finishes with more color options)",NEGATIVE
"It's been a month using this phone (12/256 variant) No lag while gaming(Iqoo is known for it), also there are many features related to gaming..bgmi runs in hdr 60fps..Camera is excellent for potraits..display is also good with various features.. battery is enough for whole day.. overall a all-rounder ❤️ Although the delivery took 20 days that's the only negetive point",POSITIVE
"iQOO Z9s Pro - 8/256GB - 25 January 2025. iQOO did not disappoint. This is an amazing gadget to own. Very good camera, both front 16mp and rear 50mp, producing detailed well-balanced photos with very natural colour tones. Snapdragon 7 Gen 3- super powerful for all functionality. Fast and very accurate finger print reading. It has proper curved display. It will be difficult to maintain this. And you'll never find a satisfactory screen guard ever. But that was expected. But the display is aesthetically pleasing. In-hand feel also is just amazing with no sharp edges.  5000+ battery - it last to the second day easily. And 80W power adaptor charges it in around 30 minutes to full.!!!  Under 25000 Rs. its a great value for money device. And iQOO brand, I felt, is very reliable. This is my second iQOO phone.  Overall its a great value for money.",POSITIVE
"Phone looks fine, performance is good, the phone look is premium with curve screen, The camera quality is awesome in this range. Overall its Value for money package.",POSITIVE
Battery life is good. Good gaming performance. display is also smooth and fast. No hanging and sound is very nice and clear sound. In 25k out of imagination. Very nice Vivo and IQOO.❤️,POSITIVE
Yeah! iQOO z9spro 5g is the phone who is looking for a good sleek design and moderate gamers and good battery life with an above average camera . I think the phone design is much better I feels iQOO z7 pro is a good design and overall phone It is an upgrade version of the last gen and in-hand hand feel is awesome and if you want good phone around 25k it's the allrounder than grab it ⭐⭐⭐1/2 it's my rating to these funtouch os may improve further. So thank you Vivo for bringing these phones at these price range.,POSITIVE
"This phone is one of the best options in its segment, offering an exceptional display with vibrant colors and sharp clarity. The camera performance is outstanding, capturing detailed and crisp photos in various lighting conditions. In terms of performance, it handles multitasking and gaming effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for everyday use. While the overall experience is fantastic, I found the speakers to be slightly underwhelming. However, this is a minor drawback in an otherwise excellent device that delivers on almost every front.""",POSITIVE
"I gave it 4 stars. The selfie camera could have been better. The battery is good, the back camera is also good. I am giving a review after using it for 9 days. This mobile is okay for this price.",POSITIVE
"excellent performance, sleek design, long battery life, vibrant display, good camera and reliable features, providing great value for money",POSITIVE
"Good product in this price range. Processor is running smoothly without any lag, sounds quality also good, impressive design, screen refresh rate also adjustable. Charging speed is normal with 25 w charge with orginal samsung charger. Over all product is excellent. Go for it.",POSITIVE
Don't Buy this Product VERY VERY Bad Quality Product they Deliver Damage Product and Battery Charging also Going to drain within one hr and i rised the complained but no action taken from. amazon ne and i went to Service center also they are not Ready to give replacement totally im suffered so much problem this product . No one helped.,NEGATIVE
"The phone has a nice display and good look like premium phone. Processor is smooth enough to enjoy the necessary apps as well as gaming experience, though not ultra smooth. Battery is remarkable for its long lasting performance which many branded mobiles fail to do so. In battery section few features are available to restrict unnecessary usage of battery. It has a number of privacy settings including 'secure card' and especially the feature that no one is able to swith it off without providing pin or pattern password. This is helpful if device is stolen. Though a handful of unnecessary apps are pre-installed, one can easily uninstall or disable them if not found helpful. The 'Phone Master' itself clears most of the cache memories and cools down the temperature. In my opinion one should restrict the 'usage access' and 'modify system settings' of the apps in the apps' special permissions section as well as unrestricted data or battery usage. Then the device will run more fluently without being stumbled or fumbled. Last but not the least, the device runs on latest android 14 version along with 6300 mdt dimensity processor which is worthwhile in this price range.",POSITIVE
"The TECNO POP 9 5G in Midnight Shadow is a solid budget smartphone with impressive 5G connectivity, ample 128GB storage, and smooth 4GB RAM performance. The design is sleek, the display is vibrant, and the battery easily lasts a day. While the camera and processor are decent for the price, heavy gaming and fast charging are areas for improvement. Overall, it’s a fantastic option for everyday use without breaking the bank!",POSITIVE
Good Phone with overall peppy performance and basic tasks. Bought for USB tethering with use of TP link Travel router. Serving purpose till now with good 5g coverage.,POSITIVE
This is one of the best device in this budget segment . Awesome looking and wonderful battery performance. Best camera in the segment . Awesome sound quality.,POSITIVE

"It's a good mobile for this price. Camera good. Battery Ok. But charger is not good, must be atleast 45W.",NEGATIVE
"The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.  While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.  This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.  Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.  Hits: The resolution is good No heating issues with the battery Battery life is good Charge time is good  Misses: Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached) The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinches Despite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button presses A few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlock The camera is average with washed out colours  Will add more later.  Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can’t be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.",NEGATIVE
Value for money,POSITIVE
Nice mobile Camera: Average camera Battery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile. Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled range Audio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice. Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that. Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.,POSITIVE
"As I'm using this device as a secondary device.. So overall it good. 1. coming to camera the I'm also a redmi note 8 pro user which gives 64mp but still I can see photos are much better in that phone redmi 13 have 108mp but does not looks like that according to the quality and video recording resolution is low that only give a 30fps of shooting in 1080 & 720p 2. battery is good & yeah charging fast no doubtedly 3. I'm in love with the ui its quite smooth may be because its new phone but according to to my previous experience with redmi phones it very nice... 4. reso;ution is also good as compared to the price range 5. hybrid sim slot, 5g, 6gb ram as well as virtual ram is also there In summary I can say u can buy this phone if you do moderate work on phone with the good enough battery backup",POSITIVE
"Sound quality is good, processor seams great, I had received it a few hours ago, but the way I'm constantly using it shows the battery backup for it.",NEGATIVE
"When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day. First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ₹ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features. It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time. Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later. I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone. I don't agree. The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.  I thought of displacing the phone. There was no option of displacement in this. There was an option to repair and damage. Then I would apply. Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it. I rarely do that. It is lying like that. I will recommend the phone to you. Don't buy this phone. If you look at the brand.",NEGATIVE
"Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.  Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.  Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.  If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.  I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.  They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.  Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.  For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: - Great battery backup. With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone. - Camera quality at this price is way above average. - Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point. - One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations. - No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer. - Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.  Cons: - Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g. - Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated. - Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage. - There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates. - Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector. So, need to shell out extra money for these.",NEGATIVE
"Good budget phone. If you are looking for a decent phone from a trusted brand go for it . Good built quality, decent camera , clean UI .

"Early review: shaam ko full charge Kiya tha around 7 pm. Bhai 6 ghante achhe se use Kiya. Battery abhi hai 59%. Battery bahut achi hai Bhai pura din achhe se use krne ke baad bhi 20 se 30 percent battery Bach jaayegi. Bhai charge hone ke time pe thoda sa heat hota hai.. bas thoda sa. Screen is all good. Charging speed is fast. Heptice is decent. Overall Bhai, average user ke more than average ya phir best phone hai. Sacchi bhai. Moto Rocks this time phone over all quality is Best is it's category. Bhai samsung bhul jaaoge bas thoda choda hota to or bhi best hota. I have used Samsung galaxy s21+ s22+ bhaut heat hote the specially s21+. But bhai moto is far superior.

"I recently bought a Moto Edge 50 Pro through Amazon, exchanging my Moto G60, which was in good condition. The exchange amount was surprisingly low, just ₹3750 for a phone in great shape. The delivery was completed, but when the package arrived, we noticed that the seal on the phone was broken. This raised a red flag, and I immediately denied the order.  However, Amazon refused to cancel the exchange, insisting that I had to give my Moto G60 in exchange, even though the product delivered was defective. This is where the issue worsened — ideally, Amazon should have cancelled the exchange in this situation, but instead, they made me hand over my phone.  In comparison, I had a similar experience with Flipkart in the past, but at least they cancelled the exchange when there was an issue with the product. Now, I find myself without a phone, waiting to return the defective device and get a refund. I exchanged my mobile for a very low price, and now I’m left in a difficult situation without a phone until I purchase a new one.  Amazon, in this instance, has been highly disappointing. A better customer service approach is expected, especially when dealing with defective deliveries.",NEGATIVE
"Overall build and performance is excellent. Battery life is very good. No heating. However, the camera function is much below expected level. May be including AI processing males the camera sluggish. Macros are too slow to focus. Tele capability is over stated. Most other mobiles have similar zoom. I did not find it any better. Even poor. I have been a stivtly moto user but this product was too expensive for the performance, in my opinion.",NEGATIVE
Nice quality and value of money 👍 great performance,POSITIVE
"Purchase the phone, value for money product, 125 w charger charged the phone in minutes.",NEGATIVE
"Heating issue, not satisfied with the phone.",NEGATIVE
"So the charging is very speedy . And I mean VERY speedy. If you put it on charging now at 70%, in 3 minutes it's gonna be 75... But the backside of this phone gets hot really fast too.... The performance is , more than expected! Value for 💰",NEGATIVE
"This is post 3 days of using of phone and simply couldn't resist myself from writing this review. Got the Razor Green 12 GB 512 GB for 32K post Bank discount. Adding some context before diving into my experience. I was an S22 Ultra user and ditched the same for OnePlus 12 SD8G3. I wanted an add on phone for office use and for gaming (BGMI & MKX). Got this one post going through round of comparisons against IQOOs out there. Not I just had one sim in the phone as I was using it. So coming straight to how I rate this phone. It is a 5/5 for me. Looks: 4/5 ✌️✌️✌️✌️ Display: 5/5 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Touch Response: 5/5 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈 Performance: 5/5 ✨✨✨✨✨ Gaming performance: 5/5 👍👍👍👍👍 Speaker Output: 5/5 ( very decent) Battery: 10/5 ( Simply marvellous) Charging speed: 15/5 (no comments) Camera: 4/5 (boosted this up from 3 to 4 based off overall happiness with the phone and considering the price factor) OS: 4/5 (-1 because of few preloaded apps) Finger print scanner: 5/5  So what I loved: Display and performance crisp and buttery smooth. OS is clean too to the most. SD7+G3 takes on any tasks thrown on it with ease. No hassles in multitasking. Got July security patch as of yesterday so all good on that front too. Now speaking about what I'm in love with - Being an S22 Ultra user I must say the biggest pain point has been battery since day 1. Max gaming time 3.5 Hrs. in the initial days which reduced to 1.5 over a span of 2 years. Stand-by was crazy bad too on S22 Ultra. This Lil gizmo GT 6T is a dream in this case. 3 days of game play BGMI 5 Hrs. each day and was left with 22% of juice still remaining each time. And post sleep of 6 hrs. the phone still retained 17% of charge. This already is insane in my perspective. Now coming to the charging aspect, this is unimaginable. Lightning fast... 17% - 100% in 22 minutes. Speechless in this front. Sammy used to take like 1 hr and 10 mins. in the initial days and post an year and half I really don't know. Gaming done without gtmode. Frame rate was set to auto adaptive. BGMI played in Smooth Extreme+. Brightness at ~45%. No throttling or heating. It got slightly warm at a point (really no where close to be called as heating) and then cooled too which is 😍😍😍. WhatsApp, FB, Insta, Gmail, O365, Teams and all other apps on the background. So you can go for this one blindfolded if you are looking for a phone with great backup and performance (gaming performance). I hope this is helpful. What I didn't like: Given all of above a 3.5 mm slot was expected. And sound output in headphones could have been better. I used Sony WH1000XM3 for gaming and Wf1000XM4 for listening to music and watching movie to test the output. Again you can hear all the footsteps and minute details and same applies to music if not all details but covers 90% of it but somewhere lacks the loudness factor by a bit and no Dolby Atmos so less to mention there. Lastly, I didn't cover anything on cam perspective because I was really not looking at this phone from that aspect and me sharing my experience on that front will definitely make no sense as the comparison will be against S22 Ultra here and this reaches no where close to it which is completely fine given it is not even 1/4th of the price for which I had bought S22 Ultra. That said both front and rear cam are decent is all I can say from price point perspective. Overall this is a bang on deal from my perspective and would definitely recommend going for it if you are not cam centric and looking for a great performer!",NEGATIVE
"Great curved screen and elegant design, amazing performance! Good for BGMI game to play @90fps(tested) without any lag by enabling GT mode🤩🥳  Cameras are big and entire back looks very premium but, the brand provided case is of no use because of its big space to showcase the cameras entire area😤 it looks awkward with that case on🤮 I recommend The GiftKart liquid silicon back case(black) which costed me 299/- its a good case that provides utmost security and also proper grip, it gives a premium look and feel for the mobile by covering all the unnecessary gaps..  I am glad that I have availed the discount coupon of 7k that was available for some period on amazon and bought the mobile for ₹23,998/- and I am super happy🥳😍 Great sound and screen, the cameras also amazing and captures best shots📸🏞️  I have used all brands from Nokia to Apple. My majority mobiles was of Nokia, LG, Samsung, Motorola and Apple 5S.. Then One+ 3t, iPhone Xr and now from last 2 years with iPhone 12.  I have bought Mi max, Vivo, Poco X3, Realme GT Neo 3 and Motorola g54 mobiles for my wife so far to play PUBG/BGMI often with my kids as well and now bought this Realme GT 6t🥳😁..  I have used lots of mobile phones and now I can say this is the best, one can get under 31k price tag! If you get it lower than that, you’re damn lucky🥳😍😎🕺🏻…  Note: The design, looks and colours are depends on individual tastes but, the mobile phone is definitely a power packed all rounder🔥🔥🔥",POSITIVE
Good and handy phone Good Camera. Great Display and sound quality Smooth and powerful performance. 7-8 hours Screen on time with normal use.,POSITIVE
"I was searching for smartphone for a long time because my old smartphone (2019 bought) becoming aged and getting slowed down, on my research i was impression that either i would go with a lower mid range smartphone or a premium (preferable samsung) smartphone.  So i was not sure that what i have to purchase but my preferences was (in descending order) Battery 🔋+ charging speed Performance (upgrade from SD855) Storage Screen brightness (out visibility must be good) 5G bands atleast 10 (most usable) UI (software, atleast acceptable)  Overall if these check boxes are ticked ✅ (rest things comes complimentary).  So this query bring me the following smartphones at similar prices. 1. POCO F6 12/512 2. Realme GT 6T 8/256 3. OnePlus Nord 4 8/128  However Poco is powerful among these with FLAT SCREEN but we all know why many avoid poco, so left with two options Realme or OnePlus then again OnePlus green line mass problem forced me to think twice and decided to go with Realme GT 6T with curved screen (with the thought that if i disliked it even slightly, I'll sell it within days).  So Waited for BBD/Geart indian festival SALES Keeping all phones on list because if prices get's uneven (due to massive discount) then preferences will again change.  The day arrived got hige discount on POCO but till then i had made my mind to go with Realme (overall good software with everything balanced and compromising on Screen because it's a curved screen).  Ordered this RELAME GT 6T 8/256GB variant (Green looks sober, classy and not too shiny)  Then new fear unlock seeing Delivery frauds (some accuses seller, some accuses delivery partner and so on) researched about this. And was waiting for delivery with All the guns (safety measures) loaded.  Parcel arrived Talked with delivery guy, told him the seller/delivery frauds, he was a really nice guy, listened carefully and helped me to check ✅ parcel thoroughly after inspection we concluded that parcel (high security packaging) is TEMPERED, is strongly recommended me to cancel because it is high-value package so don't take risk  We proceeded with cancellation provided OTP for cancellation, order cancelled successfully. Within seconds he realises that package we looking was different and we cancelled my package, i was like (abbey, Harmonium) oh brother. Then i asked to check my parcel packaging and to my surprise that too was tempered (high security packaging considered tempered with when white line don't appear clearly or turns color PINK/GREEN with clearly visible side numbers) so i was relaxed that it's okay  But i had second thought and asked him to see if he can still deliver my package, he was looking to try to deliver package even after cancellation, he tried to send otp for delivery but no luck because OTP not received (tried multiple times),  I lost the hope and about ti leave the spot then he told me to wait, he called to warehouse operator asked him if he can mark this cancelled package as delivered, he said YES, within seconds he marked order delivered and package handover to me. Then i realised OTP thing also caused due to network, so Turned on flight ✈️ mode on then off, just afte that recieved 5 OTP messages. Told him this, he said no problem backend delievery system don't need OTP,  I Left the spot, thinking that i have made a big (costly) mistake, because Amazon don't offer open box delivery and often deny Returns (service centre replacement policy).  Reached into room, placed package on table, turned on Camera, inspected everything on camera. I was too nervous to open the box.  Just started to open and when i seen phone box with security seal and plastic sheet over the box (some relief).  Carefully open phone box and took BEAST into my Hand 👌🏽👌🏽, That look was amazing 🤩 Everything sorted.  💥🌟💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨✨💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨ DEVICE-REVIEW-HERE DEVICE-REVIEW-HERE  Review part: • Battery [9hrs with 5G always on with auto Refresh Rate and with mixed Wi-Fi+5G usage 12+hrs]🔋+charging (I'm not going back to slow charging again ever) • Performance is really beast (more than expected) • Screen brightness 🔅 SUPER AMAZING • UI (after removing and disabling bloats) amazing • Speaker and camera also good (but low light camera performance is not good)  Overall I'm with this beast for next few years (maybe 5yrs) if everything went as usual.  Build quality is plastic and finger prints are visible if Cover or skin not applied.  However i still feel if this had FLAT screen it would be blind suggestion for everyone (normal/casual user).  Call quality is excellent, Google dialer comes default but can be changed to Odialer for call recording.  I felt if someone who use multiple apps (more than 10 except calls/sms/email/Play Store) for daily usage, needs to tweak battery settings for every single app to achieve optimal battery backup else would face battery drain issues (faced this but that was once in a month kind thing).  Overall no battery drain or charging issues, no issues with calls (I'm using jio). Day light video/photography is better.  Overall a BEAST I bought 8/256 @ 26k (with card discount). Please vote up 👍🏽 if you find it helpful.  Thanks",NEGATIVE
"Now it has been more than 2 months since I purchase and I have no complain about it. And I think it the best phone I ever purchased at this price range it provides almost all the features like camera, light gaming, a big battery which go through all the day , and many other features and functions. It functions smooth all the task without any hang problems. In one one it is a all-rounder phone . You can go for it without any hesitation. And it better than any other phone at this range.",POSITIVE
"First impressions: 1. While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding. 2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings. 3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them. 4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run. 5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge. 6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say. 7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant. 8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.  Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.  Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.  Update after 2+ weeks of usage: 1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive. 2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges. 3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.",NEGATIVE
"Bought this for office sim as a secondary mobile with op12 as primary.I generally use this mobile for office calls and little youtube and browsing here and there. With moderate usage it lasts two days easily.  Forgot that this phone has a camera and if your priority is a secondary phone which lasts longer with decent processor, go ahead and purchase.  No hanging, no heating, not heavy and super fast finger print reader. Display quality is okish",POSITIVE

Sometimes some functions don't work. Don't expect much from this phone. My earlier phone Samsung F23 was much better than this. Regret selling F23 for this phone..",NEGATIVE
Best mobile at affordable price must buy. Working smooth. Bgmi game is lag free. The screen size and weight is good to hold. With nice colour accuracy. Your gaming experience increases. Must buy product for you and your loved ones.,POSITIVE

"It's a good mobile for this price. Camera good. Battery Ok. But charger is not good, must be atleast 45W.",NEGATIVE
"The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.  While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.  This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.  Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.  Hits: The resolution is good No heating issues with the battery Battery life is good Charge time is good  Misses: Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached) The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinches Despite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button presses A few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlock The camera is average with washed out colours  Will add more later.  Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can’t be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.",NEGATIVE
Value for money,POSITIVE
Nice mobile Camera: Average camera Battery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile. Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled range Audio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice. Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that. Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.,POSITIVE
"As I'm using this device as a secondary device.. So overall it good. 1. coming to camera the I'm also a redmi note 8 pro user which gives 64mp but still I can see photos are much better in that phone redmi 13 have 108mp but does not looks like that according to the quality and video recording resolution is low that only give a 30fps of shooting in 1080 & 720p 2. battery is good & yeah charging fast no doubtedly 3. I'm in love with the ui its quite smooth may be because its new phone but according to to my previous experience with redmi phones it very nice... 4. reso;ution is also good as compared to the price range 5. hybrid sim slot, 5g, 6gb ram as well as virtual ram is also there In summary I can say u can buy this phone if you do moderate work on phone with the good enough battery backup",POSITIVE
"Sound quality is good, processor seams great, I had received it a few hours ago, but the way I'm constantly using it shows the battery backup for it.",NEGATIVE
"When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day. First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ₹ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features. It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time. Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later. I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone. I don't agree. The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.  I thought of displacing the phone. There was no option of displacement in this. There was an option to repair and damage. Then I would apply. Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it. I rarely do that. It is lying like that. I will recommend the phone to you. Don't buy this phone. If you look at the brand.",NEGATIVE

Don’t buy from amazon they give you defective phone and the return policy is also fake as they don’t let you return or replace the product. Even in the given time period,NEGATIVE
"Nice , mind blowing and phone",POSITIVE
"Excellent phone, Apple Intelligence is amazing, the battery life is mind blowing and comes with the best camera. If you have a 13 Pro Max or older, go for it. If you have a 14 Pro Max, the only difference you are going to see is Apple Intelligence, better battery life and slightly better cameras. Otherwise it's going to feel like the exact same phone if you use it without a case as the rounded eges in 16 Pro Max are better to use without cases. Skip and save money if you have the 15 Pro Max because the difference is negligible. The black titanium color looks gorgeous and the only good color in the current series. It's a shame they removed the Blue Titanium color. Also costs 15-20k less than the launch price of 15 Pro Max so that is a huge plus.",NEGATIVE
"I did not like it at first. Its my first iPhone. I have used Samsung, Oneplus and Xiaomi phones. 16 Pro Max has many flaws. Android is much better now. But iOS is very smooth.  Things I liked: 1. Speakers are amazing. 2. Battery life is good. 3. Overall smoothness. 4. Camera is great.  Things I did not like: 1. All the Web Browsers (Safari or others) are limited to 60hz. 2. No option for menu bar navigation (android has both gestures and bar). 3. Display / Screen color is fixed at Natural tone (no option for Vivid etc). 4. Restricted files/folder access and many other UI limitations. 5. Managing Whatsapp media is a mess (its much simpler on android). 6. Telephoto 5X images are too soft. 7. No separate Camera folder in Photos app for the photos you take with your phone.",NEGATIVE

Not even for daily uses apps. Apps take reloading just only 2 min of inactivity. >Island punch hole is just for hike in the market. Not for any use. >Not given some useful functions like double tap to on/off. Given only some limited functions. >Camera platform is not looking good. >Over whole phone is very very laggy.

Don't Buy this Product VERY VERY Bad Quality Product they Deliver Damage Product and Battery Charging also Going to drain within one hr and i rised the complained but no action taken from. amazon ne and i went to Service center also they are not Ready to give replacement totally im suffered so much problem this product . No one helped.,NEGATIVE
"The phone has a nice display and good look like premium phone. Processor is smooth enough to enjoy the necessary apps as well as gaming experience, though not ultra smooth. Battery is remarkable for its long lasting performance which many branded mobiles fail to do so. In battery section few features are available to restrict unnecessary usage of battery. It has a number of privacy settings including 'secure card' and especially the feature that no one is able to swith it off without providing pin or pattern password. This is helpful if device is stolen. Though a handful of unnecessary apps are pre-installed, one can easily uninstall or disable them if not found helpful. The 'Phone Master' itself clears most of the cache memories and cools down the temperature. In my opinion one should restrict the 'usage access' and 'modify system settings' of the apps in the apps' special permissions section as well as unrestricted data or battery usage. Then the device will run more fluently without being stumbled or fumbled. Last but not the least, the device runs on latest android 14 version along with 6300 mdt dimensity processor which is worthwhile in this price range.",POSITIVE
"The TECNO POP 9 5G in Midnight Shadow is a solid budget smartphone with impressive 5G connectivity, ample 128GB storage, and smooth 4GB RAM performance.

"I have been using the OnePlus 12R for a while, and I’m extremely impressed with its overall performance.Snapdragon chipset ensures a seamless and lag-free experience, whether I’m gaming or multitasking.  The battery life is outstanding, and the super-fast charging is a game-changer. The camera quality is impressive, capturing vibrant and detailed shots even in low light.  I also appreciate the sleek and premium design—it feels great in hand and looks stunning. The OxygenOS software is smooth, customizable, and free from unnecessary bloatware, enhancing the overall user experience.  For its price, the OnePlus 12R delivers excellent value. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and powerful smartphones.",POSITIVE
"Easily one of the best purchases that I have made and well worth its price. Pros: - SD 8 Gen 2 is fast and very power efficient. The performance is indistinguishable in day to day usage when compared to SD 8 Gen 3 on a OnePlus 12 with UFS 4.0. Even though the 12R has a UFS 3.1 storage, you are unlikely to notice any difference whatsoever without running benchmarks or checking the specifications. In real life day to day usage, I have not found any difference and I am a power user who uses a lot of applications and use the phone over 8 Hours a day.  - The vapour chamber handles the cooling very well which keeps the device at excellent temperature even when playing games for an extended duration. It almost never goes over 38c.  - The display has the same features as the OnePlus 12 (the resolution is relatively lower but it's not noticeable to the naked eye without magnification) and this is one of the best displays that you will come across. The HDR performance is also some of the best I have seen and it is a completely different experience. This can also be seen in the HDR shots taken with cameras. I'd suggest going to a OnePlus experience center and searching for 12K HDR videos on YouTube to get a better idea. Note that the 4,500 nits mentioned is only the HDR brightness at a small white portion of the display under sunlight. This is NOT the max brightness of the full display. But it is bright enough to use under direct sunlight.  - Battery life is very impressive with over 8 hours of SOT and the 100W included charger fully charges it in about 35 mins.  - Also love that the display can be used even when your hands are wet unlike most other smartphones  - The bezels are extremely slim and the chin is smaller than the one on the OnePlus 12. I do wish it was equal all around though.  Rather than cons, I'll just mention what it lacks. - Wireless charging - Telephoto camera  That's pretty much it. If you are looking for a smooth and reliable device with solid performance, battery life, fast charging, decent cameras and display experience, I would easily recommend this. Sure the cameras may not be as good as an iPhone 15 (81k) or a Pixel 8 (83k) but they also cost around 80% more than the OnePlus 12R.",POSITIVE

"This review is after 3 days of use. I got this product at a price of 14800 . I expected a lot from this device. Actually i saw so many reviews about this phone. Almost every review says that the problem about camera and battery performance. Actually i also faced these two problems. Battery draining too fast. For my use (no games,only social media and whatsapp) its not lasts for one day. . Also camera performance is even poor. No detailing. Especially at low light conditions its worst.. selfie camera is also same. Before i used redmi note 8 pro. Actually the camera performance of that device is far better than this device.. yah i think this is the compromising parts for this price.. Next come to display.. its brilliant.. awesome dsilpay.. bessel less display. Fantastic. . Also the design is not up to the mark. I purchased black color, fingerprint sumduges are on back. Performance wise, not that much lag, no over heating for normal use. But its little warm . And its ok i think. . Charging is good. Little bit of heating feels when charging. So don't use phone while charging. ..  In my opinion, if you can compromise on average battery performance and a just below average camera then its ok.. if you are looking for an all-round phone try something else.. Remember, no phone is comes with a perfect and satisfying performance at these budget prices 🙂",NEGATIVE
"Just 3 days review with phone: Pros: 1 Light weight with large battery, easily one day backup for heavy use(should put refresh rate at auto, )even with 5 g 2.Good display for media consumption 3.Good main camera- decent night, and potraits pics for the price,super moon mode is cherry on top 4.Fast charging 5.No heating issue while charging or gaming  Cons: 1.Fun touch os, filled with bloatwares, need to uninstall those and turn off all toggles of v app store, 2.Shuld take care of phone like a baby,as display and edge protection is mandatory..if not a display change could cause half of phones price, 3.If u hv obsession for curved display like me then this phone is the value for money for 25k, if not don't go for this (Based on regular software updates ,better performance, less heating issue and service centre availability I considered this over moto edge 50 fusion, but it has gorilla glass protection ,stock android os and vegan leather finishes with more color options)",NEGATIVE
"It's been a month using this phone (12/256 variant) No lag while gaming(Iqoo is known for it), also there are many features related to gaming..bgmi runs in hdr 60fps..Camera is excellent for potraits..display is also good with various features.. battery is enough for whole day.. overall a all-rounder ❤️ Although the delivery took 20 days that's the only negetive point",POSITIVE
"iQOO Z9s Pro - 8/256GB - 25 January 2025. iQOO did not disappoint. This is an amazing gadget to own. Very good camera, both front 16mp and rear 50mp, producing detailed well-balanced photos with very natural colour tones. Snapdragon 7 Gen 3- super powerful for all functionality. Fast and very accurate finger print reading. It has proper curved display. It will be difficult to maintain this. And you'll never find a satisfactory screen guard ever. But that was expected. But the display is aesthetically pleasing. In-hand feel also is just amazing with no sharp edges.  5000+ battery - it last to the second day easily. And 80W power adaptor charges it in around 30 minutes to full.!!!  Under 25000 Rs. its a great value for money device. And iQOO brand, I felt, is very reliable. This is my second iQOO phone.  Overall its a great value for money.",POSITIVE
"Phone looks fine, performance is good, the phone look is premium with curve screen, The camera quality is awesome in this range. Overall its Value for money package.",POSITIVE
Battery life is good. Good gaming performance. display is also smooth and fast. No hanging and sound is very nice and clear sound. In 25k out of imagination. Very nice Vivo and IQOO.❤️,POSITIVE
Yeah! iQOO z9spro 5g is the phone who is looking for a good sleek design and moderate gamers and good battery life with an above average camera . I think the phone design is much better I feels iQOO z7 pro is a good design and overall phone It is an upgrade version of the last gen and in-hand hand feel is awesome and if you want good phone around 25k it's the allrounder than grab it ⭐⭐⭐1/2 it's my rating to these funtouch os may improve further. So thank you Vivo for bringing these phones at these price range.,POSITIVE
"This phone is one of the best options in its segment, offering an exceptional display with vibrant colors and sharp clarity. The camera performance is outstanding, capturing detailed and crisp photos in various lighting conditions. In terms of performance, it handles multitasking and gaming effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for everyday use. While the overall experience is fantastic, I found the speakers to be slightly underwhelming. However, this is a minor drawback in an otherwise excellent device that delivers on almost every front.""",POSITIVE
"I gave it 4 stars. The selfie camera could have been better. The battery is good, the back camera is also good. I am giving a review after using it for 9 days. This mobile is okay for this price.",POSITIVE
"It's a good mobile for this price. Camera good. Battery Ok. But charger is not good, must be atleast 45W.",NEGATIVE
"The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.  While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.  This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.  Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.  Hits: The resolution is good No heating issues with the battery Battery life is good Charge time is good  Misses: Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached) The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinches Despite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button presses A few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlock The camera is average with washed out colours  Will add more later.  Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can’t be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.",NEGATIVE
Value for money,POSITIVE
Nice mobile Camera: Average camera Battery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile. Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled range Audio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice. Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that. Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.,POSITIVE
"As I'm using this device as a secondary device.. So overall it good. 1. coming to camera the I'm also a redmi note 8 pro user which gives 64mp but still I can see photos are much better in that phone redmi 13 have 108mp but does not looks like that according to the quality and video recording resolution is low that only give a 30fps of shooting in 1080 & 720p 2. battery is good & yeah charging fast no doubtedly 3. I'm in love with the ui its quite smooth may be because its new phone but according to to my previous experience with redmi phones it very nice... 4. reso;ution is also good as compared to the price range 5. hybrid sim slot, 5g, 6gb ram as well as virtual ram is also there In summary I can say u can buy this phone if you do moderate work on phone with the good enough battery backup",POSITIVE
"Sound quality is good, processor seams great, I had received it a few hours ago, but the way I'm constantly using it shows the battery backup for it.",NEGATIVE
"When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day. First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ₹ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features. It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time. Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later. I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone. I don't agree. The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.  I thought of displacing the phone. There was no option of displacement in this. There was an option to repair and damage. Then I would apply. Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it. I rarely do that. It is lying like that. I will recommend the phone to you. Don't buy this phone. If you look at the brand.",NEGATIVE
"Very good material, handy, easy to use",POSITIVE
"Althought it's quite cheap, if the phone is bulky, it falls back.. The design should have more strength.",NEGATIVE

Less money : if decreased price items means quality also less. It means not poor quality. But its not strong. Hard metal. Size Good Foldability : we can't fold Adhesive quality : Okok. It can weigh more weight.,NEGATIVE
Price wise nice 😍,POSITIVE
Good product. I purchased this mobile stand for my mom. It is good . No defect.,POSITIVE
At first I was sceptical about buying this as i had no idea if it will be of expected quality.but to my surprise i got a decent product.It severs my needs well and also it can easily hold phones which are heavy without any issues.eventhough it is made of metal the stand doesn't feel very heavy and still has decent stability to hold phones horizontally and vertically.If you are lazy to spend too much for a mobile stand just go for this🤞.

Must buy and quality product.,POSITIVE
This is really a good product for this price .,POSITIVE
"I've been trying to switch to a feature phone for a couple of years now, but I always felt the lack of UPI one major hindrance. This phone fixes that and at the same time adds YouTube for those moments when you absolutely need something to keep boredom away.  Build Super light and very sleek. Coming from a Galaxy S24 Ultra, you barely feel the phone in your hand.  Voice Clarity With 4G Volte, you get crystal clear calls. The person on the other side was also able to hear me clearly.  GSPay (UPI Scan to Pay) It took a couple of tries to get it set up. But once it was set up it seems to work fine. When you scan and pay a vendor, it takes a couple extra seconds before the vendor gets a notification. But it works and you will get used to it. However, do note that it's not perfect. I've had difficulty with few vendor QR codes. So definitely not a full time UPI replacement from your smartphone. You still might need to keep a smartphone handy if payments are not processed on GSPay.  YouTube and Shorts It works fine. You can login to your account and be able to see your subscriptions. It's a small screen, but it plays without buffering. It's not perfect. But the whole point of the feature phone is not to hooked to YouTube and Shorts.  Music and YouTube Music The phone now supports YouTube Music. You can login to your account and access all your albums and playlists. It works fine in the couple of times I've used it. Also, you can download and transfer songs to a memory card and play them via the music player.  General Tips if you want to get this as a Detox Phone  - You need your smartphone. Period. But with a detox phone, you can significantly cut down your screen time. - You still need your smartphone to book cabs, order food and use maps. But you can delete everything else. - Keep the detox phone as your primary device and use your smartphone as Tablet / iPad. Something you have but do not carry it on you. I mostly keep the phone away in a bag or in my drawer so it's not in my line of sight. - Your goal should be cut down our screentime on your smartphone. And this device is help you a lot.  Overall Recommendation - Get the phone. It's worth the experiment. No feature phone is perfect. You cannot do a digital detox without actually doing a little bit of lifestyle changes. Do not expect the detox phone to overhaul your life overnight. Aim only to reduce your smartphone screentime and eventually use your smartphone the same way you use a calculator or wallet, which is to take it out only when you have a specific need.  Good luck!",NEGATIVE
"I have used Nokia phones for more than 10 years. Compared to the Nokia 215 from 2014-2018 this new phone is super annoying and tough to use.  1. Buttons are hard to press. 2. The keypad response is delayed. 3. The Messaging experience is useless. you see just 4 lines in the whole screen in a cloud box. 4. Contact search is confusing 5. I am still unable to register Gupshup UPI. God knows what is wrong. 6. The most important features, such as the calculator, calendar, recording, and a few more, cannot be accessed directly; you need to go to extras to open them. 7. The SD Card folder opens and crashes. 8. Notification can't be seen on the screen. You have to open the message to see it. 9. Unlocking the phone has become a nightmare. You have to press the star button to open it. earlier the phones had a single unlock button. 10. Bluetooth can't be turned directly, you have to go to settings and then only some hope. 11. The home screen is full of the Network name for both SIMs.  I am highly disappointed with HMD/Nokia. They are making useless devices and it's time to shut down operations guys.",NEGATIVE
"****Nokia 3210 4g****  I bought this phone as this might be Nokia's last one and got disappointed. This is not what Nokia used to be earlier. After using for about couple of days here are some points.. Pros. 1.Built quality and looks are Great. (Very handy and easy to use.) 2.Sound quality is so good with 4g. (Good with speaker and fine with Receiver.) 3.Loudspeaker is enough Loud and Clear. (MP3 songs and FM are also good even with full volume.) 4.You can pay with UPI. (Yes it will take a bit more time but you will be used to it. caution - Plz pay before take anything from shops.) 5.It has type-C charger. (you can use your android phone's charger. No chik chik, No jhik jhik. (although i suggest you to use its original charger.) 6.Display is big enough (2.4""), crisp and clear. (Visibility in sunshine is also ok. Don't need to put extra efforts.) 7.Light weight. (If you use android then this phone will feel you almost no weight in your pocket.) 8.Fast enough to manage tasks. (No lags till yet.) 9.Camera is Just like that there is camera. (2MP camera Quality is not as good as earlier phones of Nokia but you can scan QR codes, take snaps and record videos.) 10.Keypads are fine. (You will get used to it in a couple of days.) 11.Battery backup is descent. (After full charge it still remaining more than 70%. I talked about 30 min. and standby for a day. I think it will go for 3 days.) 12.It feels really Premium. (People are asking me about the phone and admiring this as it looks so nice.)  So, after reading these Pros. you might have decided to get it, but wait, there are a few Cons. as well you should read.. Cons. 1.There is a fault with the design. (Its back cover with sharp edges will make you irritate while you hold and type on it.(These edges should have been round or a bit curvy.) 2.Not for elders. (Fonts are too small for elders. (even Notifications fonts are too small to read.) 3.Message box is a mess. (Only conversations type and you wont get any way to change it in Inbox.) 4.It takes a bit late to wake up. (you press the key to unlock it and it thinks about 2-3 sec. to wake up. Even when you power up the phone it will take about 3-4 sec.) 5.Is the software S30+. I don't think so.. *It feels like they have put a Chinese software with S30+'s icons while you operate it. *You set a contact pic and this pic will be shown in your gallery and if You delete it from gallery, you will loose your contact pic.) *I already have told you about the message box. *There were many good things that they have changed and this have become a worst experience. (just compare it with Nokia 5310 (2020) and you will get it. I have both.) *When radio or Mp3 is playing in background and you press 'call end' button for a while then these apps should be closed, right.. no, with this, your phone will get switched off.) 6.LED Flash is just a formality. (Not enough bright.) 7.You will have to make efforts to find your things. (this software is a maze.) 8.Cloud app is not working till yet, but I will check it after some time. (Couldn't open Youtube.)  So, I am a Nokia fan but not HMD hater as well. I just want to be honest, But the question is, should you buy it or not?  Verdict -  Recommended - +If you are a Nokia Fan and can spend about 3500/- for the name of Nokia. +If you need a Phone for Call, Text, UPI and Type-C charger only, rest all is Mohh-Maya. (although i shouldn't have included Text.)  Not Recommended - -If you want to feel that old Nokia's Nostalgia Feeling. (this phone won't provide that except it's look.) -If you already have used before or still using a Nokia phone. (This phones experience will make you suffer.)  Well, I have been using Nokia 5310 since 2020 and the experience was so good. That's why i bought this 3210 as it has 4g connectivity, UPI and Type-C charger. But this time i have to say i am disappointed. I can try to return it but as i am not sure that HMD would launch More Nokia phones or Not, so i am going to keep this as a Souvenir. I have been using Nokia since 2006 and still having Nokia 5.3. There were some emotions that connected me with this brand but i think the time has come up to say bye to Nokia.  Hope this Review will help you a bit. I will update this if i find anything more to tell. thank you so much for being with me this long. And Yes, Of course, I also would like to thanks Amazon for its Fast delivery service. they are really Amazing. They delivered it to me on the very next day I ordered. That's why I gave 2 additional stars in ratings.  Final Review Ratings - 1.Looks and Design - * * * * 2.Built quality - * * * * 3.User Interface - * * 4.In hand experience - * * * 5.In Call voice quality - * * * * 6.Loudspeaker clarity - * * * * 7.Display - * * * * 8.Messaging - * * 9.Youtube - * (haven't checked yet) 10.Value for Money - ** (Go for HMD 110 4g for same specifications)  Note - I hv given this review on the behalf of my experience. I will edit it when I find more. Thank You.  Update 31 jan.2025 - 1.Youtube is working fine with JIO but it stucks many times with VI network. (Couldn't try Airtel.) 2.Same thing happens with Opera mini browser. 3.Text Messaging is really annoying. 4.Performance and internet is bit laggy with Memory card. 5.Battery backup is really good. (3 days backup.) 6.Contct image is a useless feature. (once you remove the memory card you will have to repeat.) 7.You can't remove games app after using free trials if you don't want them anymore. 8.No notes app for memo or other thing to write. 9.Camera has an average quality but good enough to scan QR codes. 10.UPI app does it's work. (Didn't get any issue till date. yes, it takes a bit long but works fine.) 11.Radio and MP3 player are good to play with clear audio quality of speaker.",POSITIVE
"To be honest Initially i had added Nokia 235 to my cart :-D and i had in back of my mind that Nokia 3210 was more superior to Nokia 235. So i researched again deeply about both the phones and i finally chose Nokia 3210. Thank god my Decision was right. It's really a great phone. Pros * Strong quality buttons * good output sound * smooth user experience * Love the Camera  Cons * No whatsapp * Only snake game is free. rest all are paid * No wifi * as facebook is Pre-installed, They should have installed Instagram too  Afterall a good secondary phone to buy.",POSITIVE
"Nice features. 5G support. Good sound. Charges in about an hour. Charge lasts almost two days at the moment, for my use. Did not get heated up, hang or any such thing. Smooth functioning. Too early to conclude, but it feels like I am going to depend on it for a longtime to come.",NEGATIVE

"This phone having single camera with 52mp camera. Which provides best quality photos. It has snapdragon 6 gen 1 processor, having good and smooth performance in using mobile and gaming. I have not seen heating issues till now while playing games. Having fast charger, which full charges this phone with in 1 hour. And having good battery capacity where we can use it for more than 2 days in single charge. It's waterproof so there is no problem for me till now when I used it in rain. Having dual speaker. Came with a back case. Cool design and colour.",POSITIVE

"My ratings 4.45/5⭐  Okay! I'm writing this review after one month of usage. I played BGMI and FF, ran antutu test and cpu throttling too..  Pros:-  1) Gaming:- No doubt that this is the best phone for gaming at this price segment, I played both FF and BGMI on this device, the dimensity 7300 processor runs so smoothly so that you can experience a lag free gaming even in high graphics/resolution. (To experience true 90FPS gaming you need to turn on the GT mode).  2)Performance:- Gaming phones generally do perform well on normal usage too, same here, the processor was good enough and runs smoothly even on multitasking. (Can give a max of 120hz refresh rate). Performance wise no doubt, you will be satisfied!  3)Design and display: The 6.67 inch OLED display was really good and appreciable!  4)Camera:- Although primarily this was not a camera phone but still the picture quality was fine and good, with a 50mp back camera and 16mp front camera (Back camera was better though).  5)Battery:- Battery backup was good, comes with a 45W supervoc UF inbox charger, Takes almost 1 hr 20 mins to charge fully from zero. Can give a full working day backup on normal usage.  6) Sound quality:- Sound quality was fine, The stereo speakers are loud and clear, For calls they've included clear voice(ENC) feature too. (There was no Dolby Atmos BTW, should 've included it! :)  7) Comfort in hand: Trust me, this mobile is really comfortable in hand while holding and gaming. You don't feel any slipperiness.  Cons:-  1) The main problem i personally experienced is 'overheating', like wtf man it goes till 42.5°C while charging and 41°C while gaming at a room temperature of 30 degrees!!  2) Too much bloatware from the app market (although you can clear it).  3) build quality/looks:- The built quality can be improved, both frame and back comes with a plastic material and No Gorrila glass too:)  4) Should also have included NFC tap to pay or Gorrila glass as most phone's at this price are providing any one of them.  5) Antutu scores: When I ran antutu test, it scored nearly 670k (BTW they've said 750k)👎🏻. Although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).  Final verdict: This phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. If you prefer good camera and build quality/design this might not be a better choice for you!!  This phone worked well for me!! I advice you to check other reviews too:)",POSITIVE
Ultimate phone in this price range (Rs 14498). Screen and performance is very good. And green colour is also attractive colour. Only cons is camera is ok ok but not bed. Battery backup is good and fast charging takes approx 1hr for full charge. And realme UI is awesome and friendly. I am using this phone since a week.,POSITIVE
"The REALME Narzo 70 Turbo is hands down the best budget gaming phone under ₹20K! It's an absolute beast, packing the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Energy chipset, which is usually found in phones priced well above ₹30K. Gaming and multitasking feel seamless, and it delivers top-notch performance.  The OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate is a delight to use, providing smooth visuals and vibrant colors. Storage isn't a problem either, thanks to the UFS 3.1 technology, which ensures blazing-fast read and write speeds.  Battery life is impressive, with a 5000mAh capacity, and the 45W SuperVOOC charger in the box ensures you’re back to full power in no time. While the camera is decent, the focus here is clearly on performance, which it nails perfectly.  To top it off, REALME offers 2 years of Android updates (up to Android 17) and 3 years of security updates, ensuring long-term usability.  For gamers or anyone looking for a performance-centric device at this price, the Narzo 70 Turbo is a no-brainer. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
Review after a week of usage 1) Build Quality is good 2) Battery life is good as I have good screen on time and some times gaming also 3) No heating issue. 4) charging speed is good as 45 watts is enough compare to 100 watts as you will hardly save 15 min in all. 5) Not hanged in 7days 6) software is decent plan and simple 7) looks are subjective but I like the looks.,POSITIVE
The mobile is very light weight. The camera quality is very good. We can play games in 90+fps with an awesome amoled display. Charging speed is high Sound quality in this budget is decent Touch functionality is too smooth and can see the power of 120hz refresh rate Overall the mobile is worth to buy,POSITIVE
"Good Display and handy size device. Fast charging is good 45w and 45mins-1hr can charge it fully. Average battery- Same budget 1+ Nord CE 4lite will have 30% extra charge than this. Low Call sound, in crowd area we can't hear the opponent voice. Too many unnecessary apps from Realme. It taken 2hrs to clear that and set the phone. Speakers are good for multimedia. Decent for a normal daily use. Not a Very Good device. When I order this mobile, Amazon shows 1 free earbuds (N1) from Realme. But later they twisted it and said, No such offers for me.",NEGATIVE
Amazing performance in gaming as well as in photography under such a good price .ui,POSITIVE
"I can't post a photo because am posting the reivew from it. 😀😀 The phone delivers all things promised in those youtube reviews.  Couple of days of using it - super smooth, premium experience. And looks better in real life. The camera is exceptional, the phone is super smooth, screen and display is amazing. The battery gives me around 9 hours of screen time, note I am not a gamer but played cod for 2 hours to test the phone performance. It does not heat up even a degree. The battery charging is so good. No need to overnight charge your phones. The camera AI features are amazing, no lesser than pixel, if not better. Hope it follows the same as it grows old.",POSITIVE
"***** A True Flagship Experience! *****  I recently got my hands on the OnePlus 13, and I must say, this phone is a game-changer. OnePlus has truly outdone itself this time. Here's why:  Design & Build The sleek design is stunning and feels premium in hand. The finish on the back resists fingerprints, and the phone is surprisingly lightweight yet solid. It's definitely a head-turner!  Display The AMOLED display is gorgeous, with vibrant colors and buttery-smooth 120Hz refresh rate. Watching videos and gaming feels incredibly immersive, even under bright sunlight.  Performance Powered by the latest Snapdragon chipset, the phone is a beast! Multitasking is seamless, and gaming performance is top-notch with zero lags. Apps open in an instant, and the overall performance feels lightning-fast.  Software The OxygenOS experience is clean and intuitive. The new customizations and smooth animations make the Ulleven more enjoyable.  Verdict If you're looking for a flagship phone that combines cutting-edge performance, stunning design, and an incredible camera, the OnePlus 13 is the one to get. It's worth every penny and outshines most competitors in its price range.",POSITIVE
Pros 1. Best in class camera 2. Best in class screen 3. Best touch feel 4. Looks of the phone 5. Impressive charging speed 6. Very Good back leather 7. Impeccable gaming experience 8. Multitasking 9. Rugged and tough 10. Overall feel  Cons 1. Bulky charger 2. Slight Heating issues in prolonged usage and multitasking 3. Slow wireless charging 4. Inferior back cover (case),POSITIVE
"The display is not much curved is better, function smooth, battery power good and charging is fast. Arctic down (White colour) is best among all three colour.",POSITIVE
"Battery is great, easily stands for one day with minimal gaming and normal usage. Camera is better than the so called flagships comparing its price range, videography is a little bit letdown. Oxygen OS 15 is awesome with some great animations and customizations. Performance has no lag or issues. So far havent faced any heating issues. Overall a better product for this price point.",POSITIVE
"The OnePlus 13 epitomizes a paragon of contemporary smartphone engineering, amalgamating avant-garde technology with an aesthetic finesse that is both opulent and utilitarian. Encased in a chassis that exudes both durability and elegance, the device boasts a 6.82-inch LTPO AMOLED display, delivering a visual experience that is both immersive and resplendent.  At its core lies the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, a powerhouse that ensures seamless multitasking and an unparalleled user experience. This is complemented by a formidable 6,000 mAh silicon-carbon battery, which not only promises longevity but also supports 100W wired and 50W wireless charging, facilitating rapid replenishment of power reserves.  The photographic capabilities are nothing short of extraordinary, featuring a triad of 50 MP sensors co-engineered with Hasselblad. This ensemble includes a wide, periscope telephoto, and ultrawide lens, each meticulously calibrated to capture images with impeccable clarity and color accuracy.  In summation, the OnePlus 13 is a testament to the zenith of smartphone innovation, offering a harmonious blend of performance, design, and functionality that is poised to satiate even the most discerning of tech aficionados.",POSITIVE
"After receiving this phone and seeing review pictures of Vivo X200 and Oppo Find X8, I was worried about this phone seeing the Sun in them and Photos of Human being keeping the Sun behind but these pictures I posted gave me confidence that One Plus 13 5g is great for Photos. This is an Extraordinary Phone requiring no other phone for beautiful Photographs. No heating issues at all. Battery great. At night the battery is above 50% always. Charging is very fast. 1TB storage I bought at Rs. 89,999/- while Find X8 pro 512 gb is Rs. 99,999/- and Find X8 512gb is 79,999/- while Vivo X 200 pro 512gb is 94,999/- and Vivo X200 is 71,999. I have seen pictures of iPhone also but this Phone One Plus 13 5g is a class in itself. This phone does not have Samsung Screen which is itself a plus and One Plus assured screen replacement. This is a great phone and it has great OS. Haptics, LTPO 2K screen. It's fluid. It's a flagship phone.",POSITIVE
Excellent power services. Power consumption is very less. Battery charging very quick. Performance is very good in comparison to device's price. Taking into account of sounds brightness display quality etc overall performance is commendable. A good product.,POSITIVE
"I don’t have words to explain the quality of camera, only can say it is pathetic, poor, disgusting etc. I have connected with their team also and they told me that they can’t do any thing as camera will provide this type of pic only. I will suggest please don’t buy Redmi Note 14 mobile it is totally wastage of money and they are fooling by saying it is 50mp camera; however my old mobile provide better pic. I am going to request to Amazon also please don’t keep these type of low standard product which are costing so much. I am never going to buy electronic product from Amazon because if quality of product is not good u can’t return it and ur hard earned money will go to waste and will suggest my family and friends also not to buy electronic product from Amazon.",NEGATIVE
After using 10 days.. Cameras good for 20k.. Performing well no lagg found yet... Display and design also found ok..,POSITIVE
"I bought it on the first day of the launch, not a fan of the white cover but the phone allover is amazing.",POSITIVE
long battery life and very good display and very good experience for me,POSITIVE
"For the cost it's not valuable, the amoled panel is not that clear quality of youtube videos are not that rich and charging with 33watt charger takes too long to charge. There are better phones at less price range.",NEGATIVE
Worst product from redmi now a days. Not flexible Only look nice Rest all waste Camera not good Speed not as expected,NEGATIVE

"It's a good mobile for this price. Camera good. Battery Ok. But charger is not good, must be atleast 45W.",NEGATIVE
"The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.  While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.  This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.  Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.  Hits: The resolution is good No heating issues with the battery Battery life is good Charge time is good  Misses: Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached) The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinches Despite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button presses A few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlock The camera is average with washed out colours  Will add more later.  Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can’t be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.",NEGATIVE
Value for money,POSITIVE
Nice mobile Camera: Average camera Battery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile. Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled range Audio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice. Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that. Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.,POSITIVE
"As I'm using this device as a secondary device.. So overall it good. 1. coming to camera the I'm also a redmi note 8 pro user which gives 64mp but still I can see photos are much better in that phone redmi 13 have 108mp but does not looks like that according to the quality and video recording resolution is low that only give a 30fps of shooting in 1080 & 720p 2. battery is good & yeah charging fast no doubtedly 3. I'm in love with the ui its quite smooth may be because its new phone but according to to my previous experience with redmi phones it very nice... 4. reso;ution is also good as compared to the price range 5. hybrid sim slot, 5g, 6gb ram as well as virtual ram is also there In summary I can say u can buy this phone if you do moderate work on phone with the good enough battery backup",POSITIVE
"Sound quality is good, processor seams great, I had received it a few hours ago, but the way I'm constantly using it shows the battery backup for it.",NEGATIVE
"When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day. First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ₹ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features. It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time. Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later. I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone. I don't agree. The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.  I thought of displacing the phone. There was no option of displacement in this. There was an option to repair and damage. Then I would apply. Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it. I rarely do that. It is lying like that. I will recommend the phone to you. Don't buy this phone. If you look at the brand.",NEGATIVE
"like the camera quality, value for money, style, and mobile performance of the cell phone. They mention it has a nice design, excellent 5G speed, and a big long-lasting battery. Customers also appreciate the sound quality, camera clarity, and touch quality Advanced Al Features: The Al-driven functionalities are truly remarkable. From optimizing the phone's performance to enhancing user experience, everything feels smart and intuitive. 108MP Ultra Clear Al Camera: The camera performance blew me away!

"Buying the TECNO POVA 6 NEO for ₹13,999 feels like a waste, especially with the misleading claims about the AI camera. The phone only supports 16 AI-generated photos and doesn’t offer 4K video recording. It has a 108MP rear camera, but no additional lenses, limiting its ability to take different types of photos. The front camera pictures also lose quality when zoomed in, which isn’t great.  On top of that, the phone doesn’t have Gorilla Glass or any other protective screen, making it easy to scratch. Even though it has a 5000mAh battery, it doesn’t last a full day, and the 18W charging is slow, with noticeable heating issues when charging.  The camera doesn’t perform well in low light, so night photography is disappointing. The phone also heats up during gaming, which affects its performance. Without Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), videos aren’t very stable, especially when moving or shooting handheld.  The 6.67-inch LCD screen, with a resolution of 1600x720 pixels (HD+), is below average, and it doesn’t look as clear as other phones in this price range. Even though TECNO claims the phone has a 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling through apps like YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook feels laggy after using it for a while.  TECNO also advertises a 12-month OTTPlay subscription with a scratch code included in the box, but the code doesn’t work after just a month, which is frustrating.  The phone has dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, but the sound during WhatsApp video calls or on loudspeaker isn’t as loud as expected. For the price, this kind of quality just isn’t good enough.",NEGATIVE
"At this price this phone offers a lot of useful features. 1. Phone design and display is excellent. Phone looks like a premium flagship model. 2. Battery can easily last for around 2 days with normal day to day usage. 3. Many intersting and useful AI features at this price range. 4. It has got many smart features which feels really good and amazing like dynamic port , smart panel, AI wallpaper, AI text board 5. Massive storage and memory 6. Screen size is good and big 7. Sound is loud with top and bottom speakers 8. Rear camera is good takes good pictures but front camera is average. 9. No ultrawide features available. 10. Camera has few new features like vlog, sky shop, AI generator , AI eraser, stickers, dual video, portrait video which are amazing and useful. Overall this phone offers a wide range of features and is a good buy at this price range.",POSITIVE

"Though cost wise phone is good but some of the key features not working well or low quality 1) Display auto brightness is not as effective as it's in other mobile like MI phone. 2) Speaker quality is not good 3) Call recording there are no much options if I need to selec only few contacts to record. Quality of recording is horrible...it's echoing and my voice is high and other end voice is low. 4) Finger print or biometric touch is not so great especially when u set to unlock the screen after pressing power button 5) Display and touch I can say ok. 6) While u r on WhatsApp video call and when u receive regular, WhatsApp app hangs and closes itself. U need to restart the WhatsApp video call again",NEGATIVE

"Here are my genuine experience after using this phone since 2-3 days. # What's are good in this phone: >Battery is Ok Ok (it's 4G phone, obviously consumes less power). >Dual stereo speakers, sounds well during multimedia plays.  # What's are bad in this phone: >Software is not up to the mark. Not even for daily uses apps. Apps take reloading just only 2 min of inactivity. >Island punch hole is just for hike in the market. Not for any use. >Not given some useful functions like double tap to on/off. Given only some limited functions. >Camera platform is not looking good. >Over whole phone is very very laggy. You will literally irritated after just using 10 min of use.  Final review: If you have budget below 7k, there are a lot of options in the market in this price range. Don't trust on the YouTube's review.",NEGATIVE

"The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.  While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.  This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.  Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.  Hits: The resolution is good No heating issues with the battery Battery life is good Charge time is good  Misses: Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached) The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinches Despite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button presses A few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlock The camera is average with washed out colours  Will add more later.  Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can’t be changed.

Nice mobile Camera: Average camera Battery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile. Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled range Audio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice. Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that. Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.,POSITIVE
"As I'm using this device as a secondary device.. So overall it good. 1. coming to camera the I'm also a redmi note 8 pro user which gives 64mp but still I can see photos are much better in that phone redmi 13 have 108mp but does not looks like that according to the quality and video recording resolution is low that only give a 30fps of shooting in 1080 & 720p 2. battery is good & yeah charging fast no doubtedly 3. I'm in love with the ui its quite smooth may be because its new phone but according to to my previous experience with redmi phones it very nice... 4. reso;ution is also good as compared to the price range 5. hybrid sim slot, 5g, 6gb ram as well as virtual ram is also there In summary I can say u can buy this phone if you do moderate work on phone with the good enough battery backup",POSITIVE

"When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day. First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ₹ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features. It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time. Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later. I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone. I don't agree. The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.  I thought of displacing the phone. There was no option of displacement in this. There was an option to repair and damage. Then I would apply. Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it. I rarely do that. It is lying like that. I will recommend the phone to you. Don't buy this phone. If you look at the brand.",NEGATIVE

"Cons1. If it falls from your hand, all pieces will run in different directions. Cracked back panel of phone in first day itself.  Con2: already mentioned in summary.  Pros: 1. Useful as backup phone because with Super mode, it saves battery up to three days max. Charging needed on third day, without any use of phone within three days.  2. Keypad is beautiful, design is awesome. Very niche. Screen is too bright. Music is too loud. Beats those Chinese phones even at lowest volume. Do not expect sound quality of high end phone but loudness is amazing. Best for my old age, when hearing loss happens. Keys in keypad need a little higher effort to press but it is still better than other phones which speed dial people when the phone is in your pocket and you accidentally get hit by knee of a stranger in a crowded place.  3. Screen is bigger and LCD display is bright enough.  4. Music playlist follows a patten. No shuffling. If you nmea your songs in a pattern, same will be followed. No playlists.  5. Airtel 4G Sim works in GSM mode, Jio 4g doesn't. Will check other operators and update here later.  Conclusion: Buy an SD card with it and load it within certain songs and hand over to your parents. Load the songs of their choice and taste. Your quality of earphone or headphone won't matter because this phone is extremely useful for backup plan and for those who have hard hearing. Phone is supposed to be military grade but mine's screen got a little smudged in corner, when it fell. No loss of visuals though. Pretty good. Wish the body was stronger to withstand fall. Keep it safe and it will keep you safe, that's the simple logic.",POSITIVE

"This is an updated review : So just moved from S20, which I had for so many years to the new S24. The phone itself is good, everything works fine.. but that's expected. Got the Golden yellow colour and thankfully it's not as flashy as shown in the photos.. this is more of a light cream colour which gives a slight golden shine when seen at particular angles. It's a very decent looking phone.  When you use it, the first thing you notice is that this phone really heats up. It's Samsungs flagship and the heating issue is not limited to just while charging it, even when you use it normally.. the back gets hot. Never faced this with the S20. I feel like am using some cheap Chinese phone...well it won't burn your ear, but yes it's hot enough for one to take note. >>And now after a few more days of usage, the heating issue has disappeared. Even after hours of continuous use it doesn't heat up... not sure what happened.. perhaps some software update.  Second is the design. Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking! >> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.  The battery drains out fast aswell.. currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around. >> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.  Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range. >> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.  Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there. I think I might switch back to the S20. >> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though. The AI functions are also quiet handy. Just played around till now.. so hopefully like the other aspects will get better with time.🤞",NEGATIVE
"I have been using this phone for a month now and the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a very good phone. If you are someone who is looking to buy a phone in this price range then you probably have the Iphone 15, Pixel 8 series as an alternative option but I would say the Samsung phone experience is the best of the three unless you are into the Apple ecosystem or you want to buy and IPhone cuz it's an IPhone (It's just crazy that many people make decisions like that 😂).  Jokes apart, I would say at this price this is probably the best phone in terms of the display, software experience and overall features. The performance is also very good, there are many people who are skeptical about the Exynos chips which is obviously unfair from Samsung to have two versions of the same phone but at least this time the chip is very good and almost as powerful as the SD 8 Gen 3. Yes it is 10-15% less powerful in the CPU department from benchmarks but honestly theses flagship chipsets are so powerful that 90% of the people are not even going to notice the slight difference. I tried playing COD on this phone at max possible settings for 1 hour and the phone was hot but not any more hot than any other phone would get. Yes it did drop the battery which I will get to later but I don't think raw performance is an issue with the Exynos chips this time as the Exynos chips is actually more powerful that the SD 8 Gen 3 in the GPU department. Now coming to the battery this is the only place I am a little disappointed with this phone like if you are a light user who only uses their phone for calls, messages, music on bluetooth you can make the phone work for an entire day but if you are a medium or a heavy user like if you play games, take pictures, videos etc you will definetly drain the battery before the end of the day. In my experience I am a fairly heavy user using bluetooth, mobile hotspot, playing a few light games I always need to charge the phone at around 5 pm. But this is a sacrifice you have to make if you are getting a small phone, now if you are thinking that the IPhone 15 is also a small phone but it has better battery life then that is because the IPhone 15 only has a 60hz display which isen't as smooth the 120hz on all the phones these days and also does not consume a lot of battery like a 120hz display would. I am not that big of a camera bluff so I won't talk about it just want to say that it is a good camera with sharp pictures with good looking colors and camera features (Checkout the images attached). The video is also very good.  Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 emerges as an impressive smartphone, overshadowing debates about Exynos chip performance differences. Its overall performance, combined with its compact size, makes it a compelling choice for users seeking a premium smartphone experience.",NEGATIVE
Everything works good 👍,POSITIVE
Really good to use,POSITIVE
"This is an original phone. But it's the china variant. You will see quite a lot of notifications in chinese randomly. Plus, the biggest let-down is that it does not have eSim option. I kept wondering what the catch was for such low price, and found it during my travel.",NEGATIVE
Worst mobile,NEGATIVE
This mobile is very good and offcourse this is value for money and this is very good mobile in this range,POSITIVE
"Got this phone on last day of sale with additional 3K coupan.Here is my candid feedback.  Pros: 1. Clean Operating system... No lag. My other phone is iphone13 and believe me the touch and navigation is like iOS. 2. Camera superb with 50x zoom. This is a killer. Front camera is quite OK. 3. Best battery backup... 5200mah does last for a day for medium usage. 4. Fast charging supported... 0 to 50percent in few minutes and to 100% also fast(sorry was not patient enough to exactly time it :) 5. Yes no charger... But similar mobiles with charger have poor performance (based on YT reviews) so phone is still value for money without charger. No offense to ppl who are complaining :) 6. Many people don't recognise this brand... I was a Honor8pro user so experienced the brand value. 7. Provides private space dual login. Great feature to separate work and personal logins with one phone. 8. Light weight and sleek design with curved display. 9. Good volume with dual speaker at top and bottom of phone. 10. Capsule feature near camera notch like iPhone. 11. Screen guard comes pre installed and back cover (transparent) comes in the box.  Cons: 1. I personally wanted white color, but for some reason it's priced 3K INR more that black. I guess due to demand & supply. 2. Brought separate charger with super charging... And I am not complaining due to above 'pros' :)",POSITIVE
"Excellent display,Light weight, no lag, excellent camera. You will be impressed with camera detailing(Main Camera). Potrait mode is so good. Ui animations and working are looking like apple ios. In-hand feel is so good, compact and lightweight. I have got this for around 18k with offers and exchange.  Many of the issues fixed with updates.  Many people don't know the worth of honor product in the past i have used honor8pro that device lasted me almost 7 years 2018-2024 oct.  Updates :comes with Android 14 and also it's 2 years not 2 versions as of now in my POV & research Google released Android 15 in Q2 2025 it will release Android 16. So, hope we will get 3 major version updates.  Gaming : I did causual gaming payback2, Rc20, etc runs smooth with no lags or frame drops at all with almost negligible heating compared to other phones. Only con : NO CHARGER and 100 watt charger is priced at 3000 and if we want to take take 35 watt charger but is out of stock every time. At present I am using Google's 30 watt charger and it is working fine and charges it pretty fast around 45-55 minutes. Edit :- Got 35 watt honor Charger from honor store, no heating issue, charges quickly. Trust me I don't think you can get the better deal in this price range. It's an overall package.",POSITIVE
"Been Using the Mighty Honor 200 from the Past 10 days & I am spellbound by the Performance of the phone , awestruck with the Photos captured . The Visuals of the Display are vivid & an eye feast to watch videos. The Best part is the camera of the phone ( 50MP Portrait + 50MP Telephoto lens + 12MP Wide & 50MP Selfie camera ) . The best camera setup in the price segment. What I love the most is the Honor has collaborated with Studio Harcourt renewed for capturing Portraits of Hollywood Stars & Celebrities. They together brought 3 stunning filters to capture studio level portraits. I have shared a few pictures captured using the Harcourt filters. The output is stunningly marvelous. Posting them directly. No filters added & no colour correction done. Most importantly we don't have any photography skills. It's all the magic of the Camera & Harcourt Filters. If you are looking for the Phone to capture best Portraits , Honor200 is Undoubtedly the best choice. The Telephoto lens is outstanding . you could capture crisp photos even in 50X Zoom. The last 4 pictures , I have attached are captured from the same spot ( Ultrawide , 1X , 10X & 50X Zoom ) You could see the names of the boards captured clearly in 50X zoom. Coming to the selfie camera , you could capture beautiful selfies with 50MP selfie camera. you could record 4K videos using both Rear & Front camera . Dula video recording , slow motion video recording , Time lapse , Solo cut are the other camera options you could found. In Camera Department , Honor 200 is the complete package. Apart from the camera Yu can have the Honor Eye comfort Display with 3840Hz PWM Dimming for utmost eye care. Silicon -Carbob Battery with 5200mAh with 100W Wired charging . The UI is so smooth with Magic OS 8.0. The best part with Magic OS is , it pefectly synchronizes with the Hardware of the phone & you will never faces any issue with performance. I have been using Honor20 from the past 5 years & it still working like a charm , not even once I faced an issue like phone lagging . Thanks to Magic OS. There are so many Ai features that could make your life so easier with daily tasks. . I am not a Hardcore gamer . You could smoothly play games & the Graphics are loading good in BGMI. I haven't played for long hours to check the performance while gaming.  Positives ----------- 1) camera 2) Display 3) Charging 4) Beautiful Design 5) Magic OS  Cons ------ Charger could have Included in the Box",POSITIVE

"Just 3 days review with phone: Pros: 1 Light weight with large battery, easily one day backup for heavy use(should put refresh rate at auto, )even with 5 g 2.Good display for media consumption 3.Good main camera- decent night, and potraits pics for the price,super moon mode is cherry on top 4.Fast charging 5.No heating issue while charging or gaming  Cons: 1.Fun touch os, filled with bloatwares, need to uninstall those and turn off all toggles of v app store, 2.Shuld take care of phone like a baby,as display and edge protection is mandatory..if not a display change could cause half of phones price, 3.If u hv obsession for curved display like me then this phone is the value for money for 25k, if not don't go for this (Based on regular software updates ,better performance, less heating issue and service centre availability I considered this over moto edge 50 fusion, but it has gorilla glass protection ,stock android os and vegan leather finishes with more color options)",NEGATIVE
"It's been a month using this phone (12/256 variant) No lag while gaming(Iqoo is known for it), also there are many features related to gaming..bgmi runs in hdr 60fps..Camera is excellent for potraits..display is also good with various features.. battery is enough for whole day.. overall a all-rounder ❤️ Although the delivery took 20 days that's the only negetive point",POSITIVE
"iQOO Z9s Pro - 8/256GB - 25 January 2025. iQOO did not disappoint. This is an amazing gadget to own. Very good camera, both front 16mp and rear 50mp, producing detailed well-balanced photos with very natural colour tones. Snapdragon 7 Gen 3- super powerful for all functionality. Fast and very accurate finger print reading. It has proper curved display. It will be difficult to maintain this. And you'll never find a satisfactory screen guard ever. But that was expected. But the display is aesthetically pleasing. In-hand feel also is just amazing with no sharp edges.  5000+ battery - it last to the second day easily. And 80W power adaptor charges it in around 30 minutes to full.!!!  Under 25000 Rs. its a great value for money device. And iQOO brand, I felt, is very reliable. This is my second iQOO phone.  Overall its a great value for money.",POSITIVE

Yeah! iQOO z9spro 5g is the phone who is looking for a good sleek design and moderate gamers and good battery life with an above average camera . I think the phone design is much better I feels iQOO z7 pro is a good design and overall phone It is an upgrade version of the last gen and in-hand hand feel is awesome and if you want good phone around 25k it's the allrounder than grab it ⭐⭐⭐1/2 it's my rating to these funtouch os may improve further. So thank you Vivo for bringing these phones at these price range.,POSITIVE
"This phone is one of the best options in its segment, offering an exceptional display with vibrant colors and sharp clarity. The camera performance is outstanding, capturing detailed and crisp photos in various lighting conditions. In terms of performance, it handles multitasking and gaming effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for everyday use. While the overall experience is fantastic, I found the speakers to be slightly underwhelming. However, this is a minor drawback in an otherwise excellent device that delivers on almost every front.""",POSITIVE

"I don’t have words to explain the quality of camera, only can say it is pathetic, poor, disgusting etc. I have connected with their team also and they told me that they can’t do any thing as camera will provide this type of pic only. I will suggest please don’t buy Redmi Note 14 mobile it is totally wastage of money and they are fooling by saying it is 50mp camera; however my old mobile provide better pic. I am going to request to Amazon also please don’t keep these type of low standard product which are costing so much. I am never going to buy electronic product from Amazon because if quality of product is not good u can’t return it and ur hard earned money will go to waste and will suggest my family and friends also not to buy electronic product from Amazon.",NEGATIVE

"One of best allrounder mobile ticks all the boxs perfectly. I was skeptic about this device initially after doing much research i went for this am glad i made best decision thanks to honor for putting best efforts to build this mobile. Here are some of pros and cons  Pros : 1. Excellent display gorgeous looking screen, if you are person who uses mobile for watching videos this is for you, its also Netflix and amazon certified. 2. Camera is good especially potraits, honour partnered with Harcourt studios and portraits are like dslr better than some expensive high end brand. 3. Sound quality now this suprised me alot you get rich sound quality you don't need headphones its that good 4. Connectivity is awesome honor included new chip for coverage for pro model 5. Batterry is 5200 mah which last long till day with heavy usage and also its not lithium ion its silicone carbonate battery which has more life 6. Fast charging its cool, it took 45 mins for full charge which is pretty handy 7. Performance is good with 12gb ram and snapdragon 8s gen 3 its good chip its pretty smooth but not the best 8. Honors Magic 8 os is great lot of cool stuff with no bloatware so great user experience 9. Ip65 protection  Con : 1. No charger included need to pay extra for charger 2. Camer zoom quality isnt that great if you can ignore that it has great camera for potraits 3. No gorilla glass protection  Final verdict :  Its definitely a great phone i love using it every day perfect all rounder only thing its bit pricy but I would say it justified its pricing with quality which honor tries to provide its customers overall i would definitely recommend this phone.",POSITIVE

Good and bright display even in sunlight 8. Very good call quality 9. Good software with gesture addon 10. Good Bettery backup with fast charging,POSITIVE
"Experience is stellar at around 37-38k rupees! The good, the bad and the ugly... 1. Good: Screen- Resolution at 2700×1224 Pixels is top of the line. It is smooth at 120hz and visuals are stunning and are at par with other flagships. Not only stunning but it is safer/easier on the eys with 3840 pwd dimming. Videos, photos, games look great on it. It gets crazy bright too.  Processor- SD 8gen 3 performance is at par usual use. Gaming is good, multitasking is easy and it performs as expected. This is a quick phone. Not a heavy gamer but pretty sure it'll handle even heavy games quite well!  Battery-5200 lasts for a day and half for moderate usage. Heavy users will see it dropping in a day. Charging is fast (100watts, wired). In 20 minutes, you will see battery charged at 50% from 5%.  Camera- 50MP cameras take stunning images to say the least. Portrates are amazing, HDR balances the exposure appropriately, night photography is good as well. Clicks are so good that they are comparable with DSLRs! Front camera works good too.  OS- is sleek to use. Offers tons of personization options. Is reasonably fast and smooth. User interface for usual apps is good. Offers latest android. WiFi, Bluetooth work like a flagship!  Audio_Visual experience- speaker is good and loud. Videos on prime, Netflix and YouTube look amazing. HDR supported for all.  Other small things- form factor, in hand feel is very good-not too heavy despite good battery capacity; NFC support-you can do tap payments(no need to take cards out); signal is good (privious flagship used to struggle a little); IR blaster is boon-Don't search remote at home now or no need ask remote in hotels; magic Island-introduced by honor Long before iProducts-very useful to use for music, calls, swiggy etc. Always on display brings useful functionality back when other flagships are skipping it. Call quality and experience is great, you get call recording!  Bad: only bad thing I can say is software experience. Although, useless apps are not there preinstalled, there are some ads that make the experience a little dull. Not sure, if there is a way to avoid. May be it'll go away on its own. I have encountered this while browsing, may be just the websites.  Ugly: nothing so far.  Recommend it if you are getting it around 40-42K or with exchange at around 34-35k. This can be a workhorse for professionals as well. It can do some serious photography and can be primary entertainment device on the go!",POSITIVE
"The Honor 200 Pro is an absolute dream phone! From the moment I unboxed it, I was blown away by its sleek design and impeccable build quality. The display is simply breathtaking - vibrant colors, sharp details, and a refresh rate that makes everything buttery smooth ""0 To 100 in 20min.""  Performance-wise, this phone is a beast! Whether I'm gaming, multitasking, or editing videos, it handles it all with ease. The camera system is phenomenal, capturing stunning photos and videos in any lighting condition. Portrait mode is a standout feature, producing professional-quality shots.  Battery life is impressive, easily lasting a full day on a single charge. And when it's time to recharge, the fast charging technology gets me back to full power in no time.  Overall, the Honor 200 Pro is a perfect blend of style, performance, and camera capabilities. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-tier smartphone!",POSITIVE

I ORDERED THIS MOBILE FOR THE PAYMENT AS PER THE ADVERTISEMENT. BUT IT WAS TOTALLY POOR CONDITION WHEN I RECEIVE THE MOBILE. SCRATCH AND MAINLY I CHARGERED THE MOBILE 5HOURS CONTINOUSLY BUT I DIDN'T GET ANY SINGLE POINT CHARGE.. FULL WASTE OF MONEY ACCORDING TO MY OPINION..,NEGATIVE
Excellent power services. Power consumption is very less. Battery charging very quick. Performance is very good in comparison to device's price. Taking into account of sounds brightness display quality etc overall performance is commendable. A good product.,POSITIVE
"I don’t have words to explain the quality of camera, only can say it is pathetic, poor, disgusting etc. I have connected with their team also and they told me that they can’t do any thing as camera will provide this type of pic only. I will suggest please don’t buy Redmi Note 14 mobile it is totally wastage of money and they are fooling by saying it is 50mp camera; however my old mobile provide better pic. I am going to request to Amazon also please don’t keep these type of low standard product which are costing so much.

"Despite many negative reviews here in amazon quoting heating issues and battery drain, I bought A55 5G after seeing good reviews elsewhere, and I am very happy about the phone. This is one of the best mid range phones ever launched from samsung. Excellent display, smooth UI with AI assist, terrific camera, long lasting battery life, great sound and premium quality looks. I have been using this phone for the last 10 days and never faced any heating issues or battery drain issue. In fact, the battery runs smoothly for two days in normal usage. I am not a gamer, so can't review the performance in that aspect. But the phone tops in all other usages, a beast in the price range, got the 8GB/250GB version for Rs. 25K after exchange and credit card offers and the phone is worth every penny spent.  Pros - Design - metallic side panel & glass back Camera - Excellent UI - smooth AI - wonderful experience Battery - Fabulous Sound - Terrific  Cons - No 3.5 audio jack No rocket launcher installed No inbuilt refrigerator No 109 inch screen No underwater gaming facility No provision for more than 2 SIM cards No special app for samsung haters.  Overall - 5/5  Best samsung phone in A series.",POSITIVE
"The phone has a great body, you would definitely feel like u r holding a top notch premium phone. It is smooth in handling the refresh rate is very good The quality of screen and display is very good and it has awesome speakers they are like top notch. The quality of sound is too good. Coming to camera, its not up to the mark but u will be able to take decent pictures as well in simple words the picture are good not excellent. Front cam is very good. The processor exynos is handling the phone very well giving the smooth seamless experience. It is handling the games also very well huge games like bgmi, cod u will be able to get 40 to 45 fps in smooth extreme mode which is very good. Overall : 1.best body look 2.awesome speakers 3.extraordinary display and sound 4.good camera 5.refreshrate 🔥 6.battery backup is also good 12 hrs minimum.",POSITIVE
"Yes, It it expensive than the other phones available in the market with the same features.  However, It is Samsung, its Camera, Display, build quality, look is really commendable.  Battery drains fast if you don't enable power saver, and using it on Non-dark mode.  Overall great phone, you won't regret buying this one.  Note: Video is captured is almost 6x Zoom level.",POSITIVE
Phone is too good. But the seller has opened the box for some reason and re-packed it and has sold it on Amazon. I have bought so many things from Amazon in the last several years and I completely trust Amazon for any value purchase. But this time I think I have received a used phone. I tried to return and exchange but that's a huge process and I have to run piller to post I visited couple of times and due to time scarcity I just left it. Phone is very good. But I am not getting battery backup... May be I presume it's due to seller issues or Samsung defect???,NEGATIVE

"This is not a review but a rant. I cannot simply understand why Samsung with all its superb UI and software updates has to compromise on the hardware by providing Exynos line chipsets.  The chipset makes photography inconsistent overall. A below average low light photography performance, inconsistent shots and image processing. The phone heats up much more compared to my three year old Galaxy A71 that has a Snapdragon 730.  45K for a top of the line variant and an Exynos chipset is not how you treat one of your biggest Smartphone markets of the world.  If only Sumsung provided 8 Gen 1 with this device with a price between 45-50K, this could have been the smartphone of the year. The Qualcomm chipset would have handled the heating, image processing and battery management much better and would have held up really well in the long run as Samsung is going to provide 4 years of OS upgrades on this.  This phone would feel warm, even for users like our parents, who spend most of their time on YouTube or Facebook watching Short Videos and Reels. This shouldn't be happening in a device that's worth 45K in today's market.  I don't even want to bring Gaming and Video Editing or rendering into this conversation.  If you want a decent smartphone for light social media consumption, music, 5G, good display and good software and getting good offers on this smartphone, then go for it. Otherwise it doesn't make any sense.  This is probably the last time I have bought Samsung that has an Exynos chipset. I have always loved this brand, my first phone being Samsung Metro 5200. But they are not making any effort to like them anymore.  I hope GOI like USA takes on Samsung for selling below par products in our country at ridiculous prices.  Peace out. 🌸🙏🏼",NEGATIVE

This is best light phone I ever had & it's quick charge is amazing no worries of dead battery. Also best view for movies & series on this phone. Only I dislike is it's ambient light it's not uptomark like vivo phones.,POSITIVE
Brought this phone with a lot of expectations. All ruined.  In the last 4 hrs since delivery the phone crashed and restarted atleast 50+ times. Every app is getting crashed. While some trials with Camera was nice to explore but ended up giving Camera Errors. Did not allow to update UI. All 10+ attempts made was a utter failure. No errors on screen but keeps getting rebooted. Shame on quality testers who is not doing the check properly. Bad example for Xiaomi. My honest opinion let's have some peace of mind by not ordering this phone.  Finally it's not even allowing to install minspect device. Gosh.,NEGATIVE
Phone is light in weight and very attractive but coming to battery there is not there battery backup as expected and camera is too gud and user friendly.,NEGATIVE

"The battery gets heated fast in 10 mins while running any application The connective problem, voice disturbance. Network showing 2-3 lines the, the person gets out of network record. The fingerprint sensor is not good, have to use it multiple times. Instead of contact name and number, it shows the only number while calling and recent calls The income call takes 15 sec to show the number.",NEGATIVE
"The build and quality of this phone, both hardware and software, trumps other budget phones like Oppo, Xiaomi and others.  The software: The processing power can take some of the heaviest apps. My mother watches on OTTs while running Candy Crush through PIP. No lag whatsoever.  The Hardware: This phone is for my mum who prefers a big screen for watching and a light phone for conveyance. This phone has a big screen and is lighter than all other phones in the house.  The Features: The camera is not one to please photographers but it works well in low light to take family photos, clear scans and basically give the user decent quality photos on a Google camera than comes with so many features concerning aperture and shutter speed that I doubt my mother will ever use them. Just like the camera, the Wi-Fi and network radios are more than adequate for the price.  If you are looking for a budgeted phone to use for the next 3-4 years without and hassle or lag, I recommend the Indian Lava phone above other Android phones.",POSITIVE
"BEST FEATURES LIKE PROCESSOR, PERFORMANCE, CAMERA, BATTERY LIFE, DESIGN, AURA LIGHT, FINGERPRINT, CONNECTIVITY COMPARE TO OTHER BRANDS FOR MONEY.",POSITIVE
Bought at 10k first day of sale...good for the price Pros. Decent performance for day to day tasks. Decent display 90hz gives enough smoothness.

"I am writing this review after 2 months of my usage of LAVA Blaze-3 (5G) and I was one of initial customer of this Mobile when it was launched on Amazon.  Frankly speaking I bought this Mobile as my Secondary Mobile as I wanted an ""Indian Brand Mobile"" and I am glad that it is my Secondary Mobile as there are many drawbacks of this particular Mobile.  Lets get started with its Pros & Cons  Pros:- (1) Decent Camera Quality even in Low Light Conditions  Cons:-  (1) Battery Backup is WORST and battery gets discharged very quickly (2) Battery takes more than 3 Hours to get fully charged from 3% to 100% (LAVA should have provided a fast charger instead of regular 18 Watt Charger) (3) Mobile is very heavy and you cannot hold it in your hand after a certain amount of time (4) Call quality is not good as our voice echoes  Verdict:- Not at all advisable for usage as your main mobile instead can be considered as your secondary mobile that too with above mentioned flaws.",NEGATIVE
Very good,POSITIVE
So lightweight. battery life is good .better sound quality. with dynamic island .Charging speed fast.,POSITIVE
"Design One of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.  Display The iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.  Performance The iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.  Camera The iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.  Battery life The iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge. Overall The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.  Pros New design with rounded edges More powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 pro New 48-megapixel main camera Brighter display with upto 2000 nits brightness USB C can be used for anything Dynamic Island  Cons No 120hz display No Macro photography",POSITIVE

Good Quality and future but some options disadvantage in android it's available but iOS not available 😑,NEGATIVE
"Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of use  Pros - Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants - Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here - Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless - Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA - Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome - Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me. - The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone - Apples approach on Security! - Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless  Cons - The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm - I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases  Industry memes - USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much - Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!! - Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one? - 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting  Tips of managing battery health - Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh - Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up - I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging - Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20% - Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service - Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section - I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc - My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending above  Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.  ….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience",POSITIVE

working good.fm radio working good.fm working without headphones.sound quality good.but one drawback is sim tray not perfect.full sim not seated.mini sim suited.only negetive point.,NEGATIVE
"Let me address the main issue that was highlighted by many, that is low sound. I was worried before buying this phone thinking about the same. Must say that sound is not at all an issue. There is one trick to overcome low call ringtone. Yes, default ringtone is low so set the custom ringtone from your memory card. Choose the one that has loud sound. Battery: I think 3 days of battery backup Build Quality: Good but middle button is small, it is hard to click center ok button for a thick thumb guy. Keypad quality is good. Charging: Takes long but no issues since it is keypad you use it mostly for phone call Connectivity: Good and also we can switch off net Display: Can use in outdoor Size: Decent  Summary: Very good for old age person and also for secondary device.",NEGATIVE
"Works as advertised with a lot of ""ifs and buts"". The phone lacks a lot of things primarily dual VoLTE support. Battery life is decent only on a single 4G sim; add another SIM and you'll need to charge it daily. There are a lot of companies that bar their employees from carrying a smartphone for several reasons (read security) this is a perfect one for such niche cases cos this lacks a camera!!!  The OS could have been better, heck the old Symbian 40 series had more to offer! Not many customising options, but it has a way to sync contacts with android which was a nice bonus feature if you ask me.  Thirdly, the old build quality associated with NOKIA is dead let us not beat around the bush and directly HMD Global killed NOKIA's reputation of solid build quality.  If you know you need this phone you know. And you don't have many choices in this category.",NEGATIVE
"This is a bad product with major flaws. The back button on the phone I first ordered was not very responsive, and it needed a hard press to register. So I returned it and got a replacement. The replacement was fine initially, but the same problem appeared after a few days. I have to press hard everytime. It's a design flaw I think.  The software is annoying and gets even the most basic stuff wrong. For example, holding down the hash key doesn't put the phone in silent mode like you would expect, but brings up a menu where you have to manually set the volume to zero. Why even put the silent symbol on the key then?  Another annoyance that many others already mentioned is the red end key which locks the phone, this results in unintentional locks almost everytime. Why even have a home screen if you only get to see it for a few milliseconds before the phone locks itself? And I always have to press buttons multiple times to make sure it registered, not to mention the input lag.  The d-pad is also very badly designed, if you try to press the select button, you are sure to hit one of the directional buttons instead...  Overall, this phone is way overpriced for what it delivers and you would better off avoiding it.",NEGATIVE
"I've recently bought this handset for a second backup device and tried testing different combinations of sim cards together viz. Jio 4G, Airtel 4G & MTNL Dolphin 3G. Works fine with all 3.  NETWORKS: This device supports - 4G(VoLTE)/3G/2G carriers. Can handle Dual 4G VoLTE SIM standby ie. you'll be able to receive calls on both of them, but does not support call-waiting when either of sim is occupied on-call.  PS: For people doubtful about Jio 4G (as I was earlier), this phone is working fine with normal Jio 4G plans - both incoming, outgoing & mobile data.  BATTERY: Good battery life, works fine 4-5 days on single charge (with normal usage like calls & radio)  SOUND: Music Clarity is not very good, but can't expect much from a feature phone, sounds like an old radio. Call Quality through earpiece is also OK (not best) as the incoming voice feels low even at full volume, however on speaker phone it's clear & loud enough.  WORTH: Feels a little overpriced at ₹3249/- could've been better at around ₹2000-2500.",NEGATIVE
Good for normal use as it has 4g,POSITIVE
"Its boon to sr citizens because super radio, bluetooth, calls and clarity. 32gb storage works fine load music and connect ear pod on bluth tooth, reception is too good. Its worth buying.",POSITIVE
"The quality of the voice received on the phone is good. But the phone lacks a camera. Battery life is very poor. Battery has to be recharged frequently even with moderate usage. also the phone lacks Auto call record. The various menus are also difficult to navigate. There are no profiles in the menu such as outdoor, meeting etc. The settings menu has also limited options.",NEGATIVE
"The phone has a very complex and incapable UI which always searches in T9 inside contacts typing box and there's no scope for speed search using keys like in Android and even other feature phones like moto a10. For example, if you want to search for a contact called Manish, 626474 is ll you need to dial straight away from keypad, but this phone sucks in doing that. The default keyboard is T9 even inside contacts which makes searching Indian names a pain. The phone does have useful features such as Oxford dictionary and the best feature being contacts transfer from Android in one go. But all those are wasted because it'll take 5 mins in order for you to search and call someone. Also if you press the power button to quickly get to home screen, it'll turn off the screen and lock the keypad. So frustrating this phone.",NEGATIVE
"Very nice phone, user friendly and easy to use. Very Good battery life. This phone very useful, especially where smart phones are not allowed and aged people who doesn’t like smart phones.",POSITIVE
Great,POSITIVE
Totally bad,NEGATIVE

The phone is awesome with respect to it's budget . The battery backup is good 'at this price '. Though it drains a bit fast but that's not a problem because it is charged quickly with its 33 watt charger . At last , I am very happy with this phone . If I buy any other phone in future I will definitely buy a Lava .",POSITIVE
My previous phone was lava blaze 5g... Thats damaged due to water damage..so i bought lava storm 5g.. Its a nice phone.. Looks premium but its heavy.. Due to back glass.. 120hz display is very good.. Smooth and good.. Performance and ram management is good.. Speaker is better than expected produce good bass.. Good for music.. Finger print sensor is very responsive.. No lag.. Camera need improvement.. Front camera is good.. Back night mode is good.. Uhd mode also good but uhd mode is not upto the mark.. Details is missing.. Camera optimisation needed waiting for updates. Some network issue is there.. Due to back glass effort needed to keep the phone clean bcoz always accumulate dust Looks& build- 5/5 Back camera -3.5/5 Font camera- 4/5 Performance -5/5 Display -4.5/5 Speaker- 4/5 Easy to handle- 3.5/5 Software-5/5 Overal value for money product.. Must buy.. And support lava brand.. Lava will be a compitator for all brands,NEGATIVE
Affordable phone comparable to any other phone with same features and very smooth running system Good looking,POSITIVE
"I purchased this because I am an ardent supporter of Made in India, also because I was attracted by many features ""mentioned to confuse"" people. It's battery went down by 8% overnight when it was kept with internet turned off. It was written 8+8 gb but I got 8+6 gb. What's more Customer service is so pathetic, they said we can't help even though it was in return period and I got the wrong product, Lava customer service does not even takes the call. I have learned my lesson an I am not purchasing from Amazon anymore.",NEGATIVE
Don't buy but ok ok not bad,POSITIVE
I Purchased Lava Strom 5G Smartphone almost a Month ago for My Sister and Mother And It's A Best Budget 5G phone Which Comes under The Price Range Of 10-12K At Present Phone Is Working Properly no Problem at All I Highly Recommend this Indian Brand Smartphone to Others 🇮🇳♥️💯🤗🙏🏻,POSITIVE
"The only Indian smartphone brand which survives and proudly rising in the era of Chinese bombs. In the last few year I have ordered three different Lava smartphones and all are working very good without any issue. It has a larger display than other mobiles. The only thing it has to improve is its camera. Otherwise it is a very good budget smartphone in the present time. It's for better than realme, redmi, oppo, Vivo, Poco in the same budget",POSITIVE
Lava is actually making a good mobiles in budget overall Mobile quality is good 😊. Battery Life is also good (5/5) Display is large and quality is very good (5/5) Camera quality is not so good because company tells that they are offering 50MP Rear Camera but actually it provide only 12MP Rear Camera (2.5/5) Functionality is good can handle multiple apps in one time.,POSITIVE

"like the camera quality, value for money, style, and mobile performance of the cell phone. They mention it has a nice design, excellent 5G speed, and a big long-lasting battery. Customers also appreciate the sound quality, camera clarity, and touch quality Advanced Al Features: The Al-driven functionalities are truly remarkable. From optimizing the phone's performance to enhancing user experience, everything feels smart and intuitive. 108MP Ultra Clear Al Camera: The camera performance blew me away! The 108MP clarity is exceptional, and the Al enhancements make every shot stunning, whether it's day or night. D6300 Powerful Processor: The D6300 processor handles multitasking and gaming smoothly. Apps load fast, and the overall performance is buttery smooth. 5-Year Lag Free Fluency: This promise is a game changer. The phone remains fast and responsive even after prolonged use, which is a major plus. 5000 mAh Battery: The battery life is superb. Even with heavy usage, it easily lasts a full day, and the fast charging is incredibly convenient. In-Built Infrared and NFC: These features add extra convenience, especially for controlling devices and making contactless payments.",POSITIVE
"Buying the TECNO POVA 6 NEO for ₹13,999 feels like a waste, especially with the misleading claims about the AI camera. The phone only supports 16 AI-generated photos and doesn’t offer 4K video recording. It has a 108MP rear camera, but no additional lenses, limiting its ability to take different types of photos. The front camera pictures also lose quality when zoomed in, which isn’t great.  On top of that, the phone doesn’t have Gorilla Glass or any other protective screen, making it easy to scratch. Even though it has a 5000mAh battery, it doesn’t last a full day, and the 18W charging is slow, with noticeable heating issues when charging.  The camera doesn’t perform well in low light, so night photography is disappointing. The phone also heats up during gaming, which affects its performance. Without Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), videos aren’t very stable, especially when moving or shooting handheld.  The 6.67-inch LCD screen, with a resolution of 1600x720 pixels (HD+), is below average, and it doesn’t look as clear as other phones in this price range. Even though TECNO claims the phone has a 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling through apps like YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook feels laggy after using it for a while.  TECNO also advertises a 12-month OTTPlay subscription with a scratch code included in the box, but the code doesn’t work after just a month, which is frustrating.  The phone has dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, but the sound during WhatsApp video calls or on loudspeaker isn’t as loud as expected. For the price, this kind of quality just isn’t good enough.",NEGATIVE
"At this price this phone offers a lot of useful features. 1. Phone design and display is excellent. Phone looks like a premium flagship model. 2. Battery can easily last for around 2 days with normal day to day usage. 3. Many intersting and useful AI features at this price range. 4. It has got many smart features which feels really good and amazing like dynamic port , smart panel, AI wallpaper, AI text board 5. Massive storage and memory 6. Screen size is good and big 7. Sound is loud with top and bottom speakers 8. Rear camera is good takes good pictures but front camera is average. 9. No ultrawide features available. 10. Camera has few new features like vlog, sky shop, AI generator , AI eraser, stickers, dual video, portrait video which are amazing and useful. Overall this phone offers a wide range of features and is a good buy at this price range.",POSITIVE
"Fluent performance,but charger and cable quality is not good seems cheap but device overall feels good and camera is also good with good battery life",POSITIVE
"This is one value for money product. Resolution is not good but have every other features at this price. Do not expect extraordinary at this price point. Have 256 gb storage, NFC, AI enabled, Decent camera, This is a good budget buy.",POSITIVE
"Though cost wise phone is good but some of the key features not working well or low quality 1) Display auto brightness is not as effective as it's in other mobile like MI phone. 2) Speaker quality is not good 3) Call recording there are no much options if I need to selec only few contacts to record. Quality of recording is horrible...it's echoing and my voice is high and other end voice is low. 4) Finger print or biometric touch is not so great especially when u set to unlock the screen after pressing power button 5) Display and touch I can say ok. 6) While u r on WhatsApp video call and when u receive regular, WhatsApp app hangs and closes itself. U need to restart the WhatsApp video call again",NEGATIVE

It's not dual sim single sim slot only it has single slot and memory card slot only it's not satisfied,NEGATIVE

"The Realme C65 struggles with performance, often lagging during multitasking. The display lacks brightness, making it hard to use outdoors. Camera quality is disappointing, producing grainy images in low light. Battery life is average, and the build feels cheap, undermining its overall value in a competitive market. only good thing ram & storage else everything useless for long time user .",NEGATIVE
"After reading some positive reviews on Amazon, I purchased Realme c65 5G (4GB) from an offline dealer. Believe me, it is one of the worst phone I have ever had at this price segment. I am writing this review after using this phone for 10 days. Batter backup is so far good, but doesn't support fast charging at all even it has a huge charger. Full charging need 2.5 hours continuous charging. But no heating problem so far. It has 4 GB RAM plus 4 GB virtual ram, but some other mobile with just 2 GB RAM can handle more task than this phone. Although having 4 GB ram, it can't load more than 2 to 3 tabs on the chrome browser. If you're working on a tab, it goes to sleep upon opening another new tab and you will lose all the data othe previous tab. You Can't run more than two apps at the same time. Network: even having a powerful new processor, internet speed is terrible. A 150 mb video upload took 3 hours. If you connect two devises to its wifi hotspot, non of them will get internet. Camera is OK or good. My 7 years old Redmi Note 5 Pro and 3 years old Realme Narzo 50 4G are still perform much better than this Realme c65. If you are a little bit tech savvy or a content creator, never buy this phone.",NEGATIVE

"I have been using my bsnl sim on Android device but since I have switched number I wanted to keep the connection alive, so bought this basic phone. Right after installing the sim, My recharge balance kept reducing without any usage. We complained to bsnl but there was no solution. So recharged with higher cap of sms. Days passed, I noticed the WhatsApp account used with this number had a different profile picture. It used to be our family photo. It's not possible to change without knowledge because no one else was using this number. When looked into inbox, I noticed there was an OTP generated for WhatsApp login request. It was evident, Someone has hacked into the WhatsApp account and somehow got hold of the OTP. It's not physically possible because the phone is always in home and never used outside. There was no forwarded message in sent items. When I used my android to recover my account, it was showing that WhatsApp login OTP was sent to iphone 13 mini. None of my family member have any iphone. So I switched the sim to Android device and had to recover my account. Please be careful if the mobile number used is linked to any bank accounts",NEGATIVE
Good sound quality and nice product,POSITIVE
It takes a lot of effort to remove the back case...it doesn't have a camera and if we want to play games we need to purchase it and the screen is a little small....but the call quality and audio is amazing..,POSITIVE

I ordered samsung first without telling my mom... bcoz I like it's features and wanted to surprise her.. dono when I spilled the beans... she said she wanted an Indian product... so I ordered this...I really didn't expect Lava is really cool...  This time for India♥️♥️♥️,POSITIVE
The phone looks good but in everyday tasks the phone feels a bit slow. But you have lowest budget you consider this phone,NEGATIVE
Good product,POSITIVE
Worst product ever don’t buy this phone.. it hangs a lot and connectivity issues as well.. Amazon support is also not responsive in addressing the issue … waste of money,NEGATIVE

The sound of the device is not good. When media was downloaded from backup many were not compatible and could not show No proper service backup it was booked about four days back and was promised to resolve it within 24 hrs. Besides the repeated calls no one turnedup and neither the address of service centre was shared. False promises on site and no location of service centre available for pin 122505. The company should take back the product. The makebfalse promises on site and phone. Amazon dhoud not promote such product. It is not as per the standard quality and compatibilty of the Android phone. Mr kushal verma and Mr. Deshwal claimed to be their authorised service partendr never kept their promise. Please take back the product . Supply the fully comptible Android phone,NEGATIVE
Best at this price range i refer it.,POSITIVE
Truly good phone in this price in comparison to mobiles having price 16000,POSITIVE
"This Mobile phone has some good features, but some drawback ... 1. Selfie camera video recording mirror problem (recorded opposite) that's software problem/bug. 2. For 10w charger it's takes time 0 - 100% around 3 hrs.(0-90% 2hrs 15mns,90-100% 45 mns) 3. Battery usage time sometimes not showing/wrong showing,that's software problem/bug. 4. After reboot / switch on the lock screen came directly (my previous mobile 4 years old has feature that first input correct pin/password then lock screen came) 5. Other brand mobile (even Android 10/Android 14 4g/5g)app clone/dual app working so many installed app like Amazon etc, but this mobile only works whatsapp, Facebook (not for Facebook lite) 6. Sometimes annonymous call recording symbol missing from screen, that's software problem/bug. 7. Auto Rotation of screen too slow. This post after using 1 month",NEGATIVE
"Lava makes OEM phones for the global market and is one of the largest exporters. But it does not have the jazz of the other leading brands and you may not be able to flaunt this phone if you need a status symbol. But for the tech savvy, this is a great phone worth double it's offer price. So I say it's a silent campaign aiming to sell a quality phone to a quality conscious user. With Android 14, the software brings even greater value to the user.",POSITIVE
Lava O3 pro is a good choice under Rs.7000/- stock Android with out unnecessary apps. I am very much impressed with its display because even under sun light also display is visible. Next one is camera - both captures good pics. I think better in this price point. Battery also gives u one day easily for normal tasks. So any one needs a phone for day to day activities with a good camera please go with this phone. Thank You,POSITIVE
"I bought it for my relative, as camera phone was not allowed in his office. Its look is sleek and new, compared to earlier nokia non-camera phones. overall it is good phone, working quite good. Missing - option to set tone/keypad tones. it is annoying to hear again and again while pressing keys. If in silent mode, everything becomes silent. May be HMD brings new software update soon.",POSITIVE
"The promise of a simple and strong USB-C feature phone is badly let down by the pathetic build quality.  The selection keys are a single piece of plastic and it is touching the edge of the screen such that it makes a horrible squeaking sound when depressing either the left key or the right key - and even when depressing the top of the central scroll key. The right selection key does not even release after being depressed!  It is clearly a manufacturing defect. How on earth did this pass quality control?  The number keys are cheap and poor - all at wonky angles and sloping surfaces, leaving ugly uneven gaps between the keys. The key pressing is not at all satisfying - a far cry from the old Nokia classics that this new product is meant to revive.  It's otherwise a beautiful looking phone and seems to function ok.  It's probably going to be the same with the other 2024 models in the same series, but they have unnecessary gimmicks like 4G or camera or apps: Nokia 215 (2024), Nokia 225 (2024), Nokia 235 (2024). Maybe the Nokia 6310 (2024) will have decent keys... but it's not yet available.",NEGATIVE
It's just a normal smartphone with buttons and nothing else Only if the size of the buttons around main button was bigger I would find it better because sometimes it is very hard to press,NEGATIVE
"The build quality is decent but not as rugged as the classic Nokia phones. The software experience and keypad usability could be better, as they lack the seamless feel of older models.  Overall, it’s an okay phone for senior citizens, but the price feels high for the quality of the product.",NEGATIVE
Quality and design is vary good. Battery of the phone is also good for long time calling. With compare the low budget mobile this mobile is better for use and its attractive and beautiful design. Operation is vary smoth. Take it second option after that Android phone.,POSITIVE
"Very poor battery backup. Required recharge daily with out even much Usage. Screen blink in every few minutes without any message or missed call. Phone displays in every few minutes ""dial failed"" message. God only knows the phone is automatically calling any body. Features are difficult to access phone designed without any vision of its utilities and the category of intended users. Very very bad phone.",NEGATIVE
"This product bought for my personal use. But spam call blocking options missing even some local brand mobile provides the same. CAMERA IS NOT AVAILABLE. Battery performance OK, display and sound is OK for the money. Weight is OK but not for one who keeping multiple devices in hand. Over all quality average.  Over all mu rate is 2/5",NEGATIVE
It’s simply loveable,POSITIVE
"I purchased this phone on the launch day, feb 22 and the phone was delivered to me on 23rd Feb. The snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor is the beast, After one hour of heavy gaming this phone doesn't heat up more than 3 8deg C thanks to its 6k cooling system, The highest 144 refresh rate is the other best feature I loved the most which makes this phone very smooth, Battery is the killer, 0-100% charging duration is 27-28 mins with the 120W charging cable, the type c to type c cable in the charger make the charger pretty cool, after whole day heavy usage the battery remains more than 40% at night which is pretty good. Camera quality is on another level, this phone is beating one plus 12r substantially, initially I was going to opt 12r but when I got to know about this one, I decided to prebook this on 8th February and purchased this on the launch day, and this phone was delivered to me on the next day on 23rd Feb. I really liked this phone very much 12+12 GB of ram make this phone the ultimate beast which is very hard to beat. With the UFS 4.0 the read write speed of more than 4000mb this phone is gonna kill in the market. The fiery red colour of the phone the another reason why I fell for this phone, just looking way more than many wows, exquisite, flamboyant and next level of beauty. Delicacy is beauty: Remember that the vegan leather in this phone's back is pretty thin so I would suggest you to cover it with a transparent back case of hard polycarbonate, sides might been designed with metal that would provide more strength, iqoo has compromised on the building quality of this phone If you try to bend the phone from either side it will show that how delicate its body is so I suggest you to handle this phone with care, My rating to this phone : 5/5 Camera: 5/5 Sony IMX 920 is the killer but the selfie camera would have been better Battery: 5/5 no complaints as of now but 120w charging may harm its battery in the long run Camera 5/5, day and night photography and videography is the killing the show Snapdragon 8 gen 2: 5/5 more than 1.6mn AnTuTu score Ram: 12+12 GB 5/5 Look: 5/5 Design: 4.5/5 Would have been better in the building quality YouTube,prime video Netflix experience is next level: 5/5 Sound quality: 5/5 best in any mobile phone you will get Gaming: 5/5 Thermals: 5/5 In hand feel: 5/5 Overall 5/5 Just go for it 👍",NEGATIVE
"6 months of usage and this device never disappointed me.  Pros - No lag No heat Butter smooth game play 2x portrait photography is so good User friendly Bright display Huge display where you can watch your series movies with hdr clarity. Very good speakers. Good front cam Excellent battery with great charging speed. The backup is so good you could carry this phone for two days with lite usage without charging. Excellent Performance. Hardware appearance good Very good build quality ( I dropped it 7 times, no damage noticed) Comes with an excellent quality screen gaurd. I bought red colour of this phone , but I find the black colour looks so good.  Summary - this phone never troubles ne or doesn't even give me any thoughts of buying an another. The battery is the best thing I like about this phone as this phone never runs out.  Cons - Only Camera - when compared to premium phones it has best camera for the price. But sometimes I think of buying more better camera phone as this camera is just ok and not premium.  Go for it if you like an all-rounder phone which doesn't troubles you.",POSITIVE
"This is my second flagship phone. Earlier using realme X50 pro. Now lets gets to the pros and cons straight.... ( I am a heavy user).  Pros:- 1-) Great display. 2-) Long battery life. 3-) Fast charging. 4-) So many customizations in the UI. 5-) Best portrait photos. (You can easily compare with iphone portraits) (This will outperform it) 6-) 20x zoom. 7-) Beast in the gaming 8-) Good performance when compared with Oneplus 12r, Realme gt 6t. 9-) Charging speed. (You need to turn on the option Fast charging from the settings search)  * Now lets get to the cons:-  1-) Build quality is below average. 2-) No dolby atmos support even at this price range, so if you have high resistant earbuds (LDAC) than you will feel very sad, sound will not be that kind of the earbuds which supports Dolby atmos with LDAC. 3-) Issues and bugs in UI (Realme Link app dont runs in it) 4-) Camera is okayish (Not accepted for this price range) (But you can install a gcam from telegram channels) (it will work more good) 5-) No root support. 6-) No good video recording quality. 7-) UI is an average. Some options are very hard to find. 8-) No NFC so no Tap and pay.  Verdict:- 1-) For Gamers:- If you are planning to buy this phone for a gaming purpose than blindly go for it but remember one thing that dont update the phone,another the performance will get decreased. Every brand degrades the performance with every update.  2-) For camera lovers:- Stay away, Go with Pixel 8. Also Gcam support is not available with this phone.  3-) For performance lovers:- Blindly go for it if you can compromise the camera and UI.  Overall it is a good phone with some pros and cons. Kindly read this review and buy.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: Display, good potrait mode, fast charging, battery backup, good UI, good for gaming, no hanging  Mobile is a bit on heavier side but sturdy  Cons: Picture quality can be better, no other cons that I observed",POSITIVE
"Best phone in this price range, best display, best performance, camera is decent, battery is also good, what do you need more. Even till the end of 2024 this is the best phone in terms of display, speed and performance. You don't need any flagship phone above 50000, 60000. I had iPhone 12 before this and I can tell you happily that this phone is far and far better than those iphones 12,13,14,15 even 16. You can compare their specs even in hand feel, performance. I feel stupid that I had iPhone instead of this.",POSITIVE
"Above my expectations. It has value of money in everything i.e design, durability, quality, functionality etc. best for middle class people",POSITIVE
"This is post 3 days of using of phone and simply couldn't resist myself from writing this review. Got the Razor Green 12 GB 512 GB for 32K post Bank discount. Adding some context before diving into my experience. I was an S22 Ultra user and ditched the same for OnePlus 12 SD8G3. I wanted an add on phone for office use and for gaming (BGMI & MKX). Got this one post going through round of comparisons against IQOOs out there. Not I just had one sim in the phone as I was using it. So coming straight to how I rate this phone. It is a 5/5 for me. Looks: 4/5 ✌️✌️✌️✌️ Display: 5/5 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Touch Response: 5/5 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈 Performance: 5/5 ✨✨✨✨✨ Gaming performance: 5/5 👍👍👍👍👍 Speaker Output: 5/5 ( very decent) Battery: 10/5 ( Simply marvellous) Charging speed: 15/5 (no comments) Camera: 4/5 (boosted this up from 3 to 4 based off overall happiness with the phone and considering the price factor) OS: 4/5 (-1 because of few preloaded apps) Finger print scanner: 5/5  So what I loved: Display and performance crisp and buttery smooth. OS is clean too to the most. SD7+G3 takes on any tasks thrown on it with ease. No hassles in multitasking. Got July security patch as of yesterday so all good on that front too. Now speaking about what I'm in love with - Being an S22 Ultra user I must say the biggest pain point has been battery since day 1. Max gaming time 3.5 Hrs. in the initial days which reduced to 1.5 over a span of 2 years. Stand-by was crazy bad too on S22 Ultra. This Lil gizmo GT 6T is a dream in this case. 3 days of game play BGMI 5 Hrs. each day and was left with 22% of juice still remaining each time. And post sleep of 6 hrs. the phone still retained 17% of charge. This already is insane in my perspective. Now coming to the charging aspect, this is unimaginable. Lightning fast... 17% - 100% in 22 minutes. Speechless in this front. Sammy used to take like 1 hr and 10 mins. in the initial days and post an year and half I really don't know. Gaming done without gtmode. Frame rate was set to auto adaptive. BGMI played in Smooth Extreme+. Brightness at ~45%. No throttling or heating. It got slightly warm at a point (really no where close to be called as heating) and then cooled too which is 😍😍😍. WhatsApp, FB, Insta, Gmail, O365, Teams and all other apps on the background. So you can go for this one blindfolded if you are looking for a phone with great backup and performance (gaming performance). I hope this is helpful. What I didn't like: Given all of above a 3.5 mm slot was expected. And sound output in headphones could have been better. I used Sony WH1000XM3 for gaming and Wf1000XM4 for listening to music and watching movie to test the output. Again you can hear all the footsteps and minute details and same applies to music if not all details but covers 90% of it but somewhere lacks the loudness factor by a bit and no Dolby Atmos so less to mention there. Lastly, I didn't cover anything on cam perspective because I was really not looking at this phone from that aspect and me sharing my experience on that front will definitely make no sense as the comparison will be against S22 Ultra here and this reaches no where close to it which is completely fine given it is not even 1/4th of the price for which I had bought S22 Ultra. That said both front and rear cam are decent is all I can say from price point perspective. Overall this is a bang on deal from my perspective and would definitely recommend going for it if you are not cam centric and looking for a great performer!",NEGATIVE
"Great curved screen and elegant design, amazing performance! Good for BGMI game to play @90fps(tested) without any lag by enabling GT mode🤩🥳  Cameras are big and entire back looks very premium but, the brand provided case is of no use because of its big space to showcase the cameras entire area😤 it looks awkward with that case on🤮 I recommend The GiftKart liquid silicon back case(black) which costed me 299/- its a good case that provides utmost security and also proper grip, it gives a premium look and feel for the mobile by covering all the unnecessary gaps..  I am glad that I have availed the discount coupon of 7k that was available for some period on amazon and bought the mobile for ₹23,998/- and I am super happy🥳😍 Great sound and screen, the cameras also amazing and captures best shots📸🏞️  I have used all brands from Nokia to Apple. My majority mobiles was of Nokia, LG, Samsung, Motorola and Apple 5S.. Then One+ 3t, iPhone Xr and now from last 2 years with iPhone 12.  I have bought Mi max, Vivo, Poco X3, Realme GT Neo 3 and Motorola g54 mobiles for my wife so far to play PUBG/BGMI often with my kids as well and now bought this Realme GT 6t🥳😁..  I have used lots of mobile phones and now I can say this is the best, one can get under 31k price tag! If you get it lower than that, you’re damn lucky🥳😍😎🕺🏻…  Note: The design, looks and colours are depends on individual tastes but, the mobile phone is definitely a power packed all rounder🔥🔥🔥",POSITIVE
Good and handy phone Good Camera. Great Display and sound quality Smooth and powerful performance. 7-8 hours Screen on time with normal use.,POSITIVE
"I was searching for smartphone for a long time because my old smartphone (2019 bought) becoming aged and getting slowed down, on my research i was impression that either i would go with a lower mid range smartphone or a premium (preferable samsung) smartphone.  So i was not sure that what i have to purchase but my preferences was (in descending order) Battery 🔋+ charging speed Performance (upgrade from SD855) Storage Screen brightness (out visibility must be good) 5G bands atleast 10 (most usable) UI (software, atleast acceptable)  Overall if these check boxes are ticked ✅ (rest things comes complimentary).  So this query bring me the following smartphones at similar prices. 1. POCO F6 12/512 2. Realme GT 6T 8/256 3. OnePlus Nord 4 8/128  However Poco is powerful among these with FLAT SCREEN but we all know why many avoid poco, so left with two options Realme or OnePlus then again OnePlus green line mass problem forced me to think twice and decided to go with Realme GT 6T with curved screen (with the thought that if i disliked it even slightly, I'll sell it within days).  So Waited for BBD/Geart indian festival SALES Keeping all phones on list because if prices get's uneven (due to massive discount) then preferences will again change.  The day arrived got hige discount on POCO but till then i had made my mind to go with Realme (overall good software with everything balanced and compromising on Screen because it's a curved screen).  Ordered this RELAME GT 6T 8/256GB variant (Green looks sober, classy and not too shiny)  Then new fear unlock seeing Delivery frauds (some accuses seller, some accuses delivery partner and so on) researched about this. And was waiting for delivery with All the guns (safety measures) loaded.  Parcel arrived Talked with delivery guy, told him the seller/delivery frauds, he was a really nice guy, listened carefully and helped me to check ✅ parcel thoroughly after inspection we concluded that parcel (high security packaging) is TEMPERED, is strongly recommended me to cancel because it is high-value package so don't take risk  We proceeded with cancellation provided OTP for cancellation, order cancelled successfully. Within seconds he realises that package we looking was different and we cancelled my package, i was like (abbey, Harmonium) oh brother. Then i asked to check my parcel packaging and to my surprise that too was tempered (high security packaging considered tempered with when white line don't appear clearly or turns color PINK/GREEN with clearly visible side numbers) so i was relaxed that it's okay  But i had second thought and asked him to see if he can still deliver my package, he was looking to try to deliver package even after cancellation, he tried to send otp for delivery but no luck because OTP not received (tried multiple times),  I lost the hope and about ti leave the spot then he told me to wait, he called to warehouse operator asked him if he can mark this cancelled package as delivered, he said YES, within seconds he marked order delivered and package handover to me. Then i realised OTP thing also caused due to network, so Turned on flight ✈️ mode on then off, just afte that recieved 5 OTP messages. Told him this, he said no problem backend delievery system don't need OTP,  I Left the spot, thinking that i have made a big (costly) mistake, because Amazon don't offer open box delivery and often deny Returns (service centre replacement policy).  Reached into room, placed package on table, turned on Camera, inspected everything on camera. I was too nervous to open the box.  Just started to open and when i seen phone box with security seal and plastic sheet over the box (some relief).  Carefully open phone box and took BEAST into my Hand 👌🏽👌🏽, That look was amazing 🤩 Everything sorted.  💥🌟💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨✨💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨ DEVICE-REVIEW-HERE DEVICE-REVIEW-HERE  Review part: • Battery [9hrs with 5G always on with auto Refresh Rate and with mixed Wi-Fi+5G usage 12+hrs]🔋+charging (I'm not going back to slow charging again ever) • Performance is really beast (more than expected) • Screen brightness 🔅 SUPER AMAZING • UI (after removing and disabling bloats) amazing • Speaker and camera also good (but low light camera performance is not good)  Overall I'm with this beast for next few years (maybe 5yrs) if everything went as usual.  Build quality is plastic and finger prints are visible if Cover or skin not applied.  However i still feel if this had FLAT screen it would be blind suggestion for everyone (normal/casual user).  Call quality is excellent, Google dialer comes default but can be changed to Odialer for call recording.  I felt if someone who use multiple apps (more than 10 except calls/sms/email/Play Store) for daily usage, needs to tweak battery settings for every single app to achieve optimal battery backup else would face battery drain issues (faced this but that was once in a month kind thing).  Overall no battery drain or charging issues, no issues with calls (I'm using jio). Day light video/photography is better.  Overall a BEAST I bought 8/256 @ 26k (with card discount). Please vote up 👍🏽 if you find it helpful.  Thanks",NEGATIVE

"I've been using this mobile for a couple of days, and I'm thrilled with it! Although I live on the outskirts and struggle to get 5G in some remote rooms with the Realme 9i 5G, my new Oppo A3 Pro delivers the 5G coverage I hoped for, even inside the house. While I'm not into heavy gaming, the lighter games I enjoy are running smoothly. Here are some highlights and things to consider that others might find helpful:  **Highlights:**  1. **5G Network:** If you're in the outskirts of West Bengal, Airtel is your best bet for 5G. The Oppo A3 Pro gives me fantastic 5G coverage, even in tricky spots. 2. **Battery:** The battery life is quite good and should last a day, even with light gaming. 3. **Design:** The design is wonderfully eye-catching! 4. **Camera:** It's decent, and while I'm not a camera enthusiast, it does the job. 5. **Sound:** The sound is impressively loud. 6. **Build:** It's sturdy and splash-proof, with an IP54 rating.  **Things to Consider:**  1. **Price:** The market price is ₹21,000, which might be on the high side, though I got a deal at ₹17,000. It’s worth considering how much you value these features. 2. **Processor:** The processor might not meet expectations for heavy gaming, but it hasn't been an issue for my usage. 3. **Charger:** The charging isn't quite as fast as advertised, taking about 1 hour and 50 minutes to go from 20% to 100%. 4. **Hybrid SIM Slot:** Keep in mind the device supports either two SIMs or one SIM and an SD card.  **Verdict:** If you're open to spending a bit more and don't mind using a few less 5G bands, the iQOO Z9 could be worth considering. For me, the Oppo A3 Pro has been a delightful choice and a great fit for my needs!",POSITIVE
"Amazon delivered a defective product. Requested for an inspection and service personnel said the set is defective and Amazon should replace it. When I contacted Amazon customer support their technical team started talking like legal experts. They tried to evade and told that I may go to a service centre but they won't replace it . Then why do they have a replacement option available , perhaps to cheat the customers. Don't buy from Amazon",NEGATIVE

Display kaafi sharp aur bright hai, aur design bhi sleek aur premium feel hota hai. Overall, yeh phone ek perfect combination hai of performance, battery, camera, aur storage ka. Definitely worth buying!",POSITIVE

"The Nokia 105 Classic is a straightforward mobile phone designed for basic communication needs. It features a small color display, physical keypad, dual SIM support, FM radio, and a flashlight. Its focus is on simplicity and reliability.  The standout feature of the Nokia 105 Classic is its exceptional battery life, lasting several weeks on standby. It's easy to use, making it suitable for all age groups. The FM radio adds a nice entertainment option, and the phone's sturdy build quality inspires confidence.  Due to its basic nature, the Nokia 105 Classic lacks internet connectivity and has a limited camera. The small screen size can be challenging for reading text or viewing images. It's not ideal for tasks like web browsing or multimedia.  Considering its low price, the Nokia 105 Classic offers excellent value for money. It's a reliable device for calls and texts, making it a practical choice for those who don't need advanced features.  The Nokia 105 Classic has a simple and compact design with a tactile keypad. It's lightweight and comfortable to hold, with a durable construction that feels solid.  - The phone's dual SIM support allows users to manage two phone numbers simultaneously, which is convenient for those who need separate numbers for work and personal use. - The inclusion of a flashlight is handy for emergencies or when additional light is needed in dark environments.

"Here are my genuine experience after using this phone since 2-3 days. # What's are good in this phone: >Battery is Ok Ok (it's 4G phone, obviously consumes less power). >Dual stereo speakers, sounds well during multimedia plays.  # What's are bad in this phone: >Software is not up to the mark. Not even for daily uses apps. Apps take reloading just only 2 min of inactivity. >Island punch hole is just for hike in the market. Not for any use. >Not given some useful functions like double tap to on/off. Given only some limited functions. >Camera platform is not looking good. >Over whole phone is very very laggy.

Phone is of low quality. Gave a boot error on the 2nd day. You don't get any support from Amazon Customer Service as they will advice you to go to Itel service center. Serviced the phone from the service center and if didn't last 24 hours. Difficult to get a refund and you will be forced to run after Amazon Customer support and Itel Service center. Absolutely useless product and substandard service.,NEGATIVE

I will suggest please don’t buy Redmi Note 14 mobile it is totally wastage of money and they are fooling by saying it is 50mp camera; however my old mobile provide better pic. I am going to request to Amazon also please don’t keep these type of low standard product which are costing so much. I am never going to buy electronic product from Amazon because if quality of product is not good u can’t return it and ur hard earned money will go to waste and will suggest my family and friends also not to buy electronic product from Amazon.",NEGATIVE

Got it today and hated it for having dull color. Not sure what it is! Description tells that this phone will have superb clarity but that's not true. I had Vivo that had vivid colors. They got Narzo N55 that had brighter colors than Vivo but not sharp. And now this one doesn't have any of the good attributes. Rest I am yet to explore.,NEGATIVE

"The build and quality of this phone, both hardware and software, trumps other budget phones like Oppo, Xiaomi and others.  The software: The processing power can take some of the heaviest apps. My mother watches on OTTs while running Candy Crush through PIP. No lag whatsoever.  The Hardware: This phone is for my mum who prefers a big screen for watching and a light phone for conveyance. This phone has a big screen and is lighter than all other phones in the house.  The Features: The camera is not one to please photographers but it works well in low light to take family photos, clear scans and basically give the user decent quality photos on a Google camera than comes with so many features concerning aperture and shutter speed that I doubt my mother will ever use them. Just like the camera, the Wi-Fi and network radios are more than adequate for the price.  If you are looking for a budgeted phone to use for the next 3-4 years without and hassle or lag, I recommend the Indian Lava phone above other Android phones.",POSITIVE

"I am writing this review after 2 months of my usage of LAVA Blaze-3 (5G) and I was one of initial customer of this Mobile when it was launched on Amazon.  Frankly speaking I bought this Mobile as my Secondary Mobile as I wanted an ""Indian Brand Mobile"" and I am glad that it is my Secondary Mobile as there are many drawbacks of this particular Mobile.  Lets get started with its Pros & Cons  Pros:- (1) Decent Camera Quality even in Low Light Conditions  Cons:-  (1) Battery Backup is WORST and battery gets discharged very quickly (2) Battery takes more than 3 Hours to get fully charged from 3% to 100% (LAVA should have provided a fast charger instead of regular 18 Watt Charger) (3) Mobile is very heavy and you cannot hold it in your hand after a certain amount of time (4) Call quality is not good as our voice echoes  Verdict:- Not at all advisable for usage as your main mobile instead can be considered as your secondary mobile that too with above mentioned flaws.",NEGATIVE

"I always prefer this mobile due to its outstanding value for money. It's actually a alrounder phone . The look and feel is really good. It's light weight and the performance is top notch . Out standing previously I brought another phone and it was equipped with mediatek old 12 nm chipset I thought snapdragon is good and it's bad but this phone is come with 4 nm chip. Best power efficient and. Power delivery with the help of this chip. Display is super b . I switch to 120 htz it's butterfly smooth. Colour accuracy is good d it will support 4k vedio play back due to the efficiency of the chip. Camera is also so good . This is my secondary phone because i ready have an iPhone 13 but I changed my mind now this is my primary phone and using iPhone as my secondary. This is a honest review you can buy without any issues for sure. One more while playing pubg or other intense game the phone gets hot after sometime that too not so much a moderate hot. Charging speed is good. About ui it's really bad not so user friendly UI. better use Nova launcher which is I am using, be sure you are turning off advertisements and hide pre-installed some apps. Enough now enjoy the stock android experience 😀",POSITIVE
Pros: 1. Display is good even it's a 8 bit amoled panel but the quality of panel is good. 2. Camera are really good in this price range. If you want a good camera phone in this price then this is a good choice. 3. Performance is decent. PUBG 55 - 60 fps constant. 4. No heating issue even while gaming. 5. 5G and wifi connectivity are good. 6. Very comfortable in hand feel. 7. Battery backup is good and charging speed is decent (1 hour 5 min) for full charge.  Cons: 1. Speaker is not that good. 2. Haptics are not good. 3. Full plastic build. Getting scratches easily on phone's body. 4. 3.5 mm jack is not available.,NEGATIVE

"Writing this review after 20 days usage. In my opinion  1. if anyone need to buy light weight mobile I will recomend to buy.  2. Best UI in recent time there is no lag when operating the mobile, opening an app like Hot star, Netflix app there is no lag and no delay on open a video.  3. Camera best quality in camera amazing front 16MP and back 50MP one of the best get live location scenery.  4. Battery Life - For only soft use without any Gaming guarantee upto 48 hrs charge life. Fast charging from 20% to 100% in just 45 to 50 mins.  5. Feel less when playing Games, I am playing PUBG games it took battery drainage slightly up. When playing 2 hrs 10 to 15% charge is going down.  6. Heating Issue - There is no heating issue when playing games. played 2 hrs not feel any heating problem. Recommended this for all heavy users. (Note - it's my views, it's upto you how many hours you are using)  7. Game Mode - Fantastic when On Ultra Game mode, you can control your battery life mode when playing games, as said above still battery might fell down as per my previous review.  8. Music is best like Vivo up and down speakers provide best quality. Using Boult ear buds gives you a different feel when hearing music.  9. Video - 1800x2400 video resolution gives best viewing experience when watching videos  10. Over all Review - One of best mobile satisfied with all performance till now.

"Good product in this price range. Processor is running smoothly without any lag, sounds quality also good, impressive design, screen refresh rate also adjustable. Charging speed is normal with 25 w charge with orginal samsung charger. Over all product is excellent. Go for it.",POSITIVE
Don't Buy this Product VERY VERY Bad Quality Product they Deliver Damage Product and Battery Charging also Going to drain within one hr and i rised the complained but no action taken from. amazon ne and i went to Service center also they are not Ready to give replacement totally im suffered so much problem this product . No one helped.,NEGATIVE
"The phone has a nice display and good look like premium phone. Processor is smooth enough to enjoy the necessary apps as well as gaming experience, though not ultra smooth. Battery is remarkable for its long lasting performance which many branded mobiles fail to do so. In battery section few features are available to restrict unnecessary usage of battery. It has a number of privacy settings including 'secure card' and especially the feature that no one is able to swith it off without providing pin or pattern password. This is helpful if device is stolen. Though a handful of unnecessary apps are pre-installed, one can easily uninstall or disable them if not found helpful. The 'Phone Master' itself clears most of the cache memories and cools down the temperature. In my opinion one should restrict the 'usage access' and 'modify system settings' of the apps in the apps' special permissions section as well as unrestricted data or battery usage. Then the device will run more fluently without being stumbled or fumbled. Last but not the least, the device runs on latest android 14 version along with 6300 mdt dimensity processor which is worthwhile in this price range.",POSITIVE
"The TECNO POP 9 5G in Midnight Shadow is a solid budget smartphone with impressive 5G connectivity, ample 128GB storage, and smooth 4GB RAM performance. The design is sleek, the display is vibrant, and the battery easily lasts a day. While the camera and processor are decent for the price, heavy gaming and fast charging are areas for improvement. Overall, it’s a fantastic option for everyday use without breaking the bank!",POSITIVE

"I purchased this mobile recently, and I'm very disappointed with the product. The charger stopped working within a short time, which is unacceptable for a new purchase. Additionally, the battery life is poor—it lasts only 20 hours on a full charge, even with moderate use. I expected better quality for the price I paid. I wouldn't recommend this product to others.",NEGATIVE
Mobile device is ok but charger is not working so I contacted to customer care they are now giving me new charger.,NEGATIVE
Olden days Nokia brand was famous on mobile but now performance of the particular item is far from satisfactory. Speaker of the mobile is not upto the mark compared to other phones of similar price. When the volume is put in maximum the sound getting is very very less and sound also cracking. This should be attended to. Overall performance is not satisfactory. Replacement received yesterday and that too with battery problem. This batch of Nokia phone is completely worthless.,NEGATIVE
Cute and handy,POSITIVE
Good product,POSITIVE
"I like symbian OS basic mobiles, but this one is worst. After 2 days of usage, i put back the mobile in the box and started using my old samsung metro 350 basic phone.  My samsung mobile has plenty of options but nokia lacks entirely. Utter waste OS. Samsung has many shortcut menus and options. Nokia has nothing.  Even sound profile options missing. For silent mode, we need to manually reduce the sound. That also continues pressing not available. For reducing sound level 6 to 0, you have to press 6 times.  After 5 minutes of internet usage, battery down almost 50%. After OS update all contacts erased.  Plastic body very light. Samsung phone body really strong. Sim also, nano sim.  This OS cannot be compared with old nokia phone. That much poorly built.  HMD global version of Nokia is really disappointing.  Going to sell this phone in olx.",NEGATIVE

"The OnePlus Nord CE4 Lite 5G emerges as a compelling mid-range smartphone that offers excellent value for budget-conscious consumers. Here's a detailed breakdown of its key strengths and minor limitations:  Standout Features: - Battery Performance: Exceptional 5,500 mAh battery that easily lasts a full day, complemented by blazing-fast 80W SUPERVOOC charging - Display: Bright 6.67-inch AMOLED screen with 120Hz refresh rate, offering smooth and vibrant visuals - Camera: Decent 50MP Sony LYT-600 primary camera with good daylight performance  Pros: - Long-lasting battery life - Fast charging capability - Bright AMOLED display - Affordable pricing - OxygenOS 14 based on Android 14 - Expandable storage up to 2TB  Cons: - Uses an older Snapdragon 695 processor - Limited video recording to 1080p - No wireless charging - Only two rear cameras with a basic 2MP depth sensor  Final Verdict: The OnePlus Nord CE4 Lite 5G is an excellent choice for users seeking a reliable, budget-friendly smartphone with strong battery performance and a smooth user experience. It may not be revolutionary, but it delivers solid value for everyday use.",POSITIVE
My review : Performance [ 4/5 ] - Gaming Performance good but you'll see some frame drops and lag somewhere while using but a great gaming experience at this price. Camera [ 3/5 ] - Very limit features in camera app and quality is also not good and you'll find better options in market at 20k. Battery [ 5/5 ] - Awesome battery life and 80w fast charging is crazy and will take about 40m-60m for 0-100%. Display [ 4.5/5 ] - Good display quality in this price segment. Software [ 4/5 ] - Somewhere a decent ui experience but if you are looking for a good ui then Samsung ofc will be the best option. Conclusion - If you are looking for a phone for normal use and don't use camera that much then it's a great choice but OnePlus as a company is not offering you something special if you buy at by seeing their brand value and it's quite similar to Realme Mobiles.,NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:  Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.  Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.  Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.  Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.  Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.  Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.  In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.",POSITIVE

The torch light is bright and useful, and the VGA camera takes great photos. The battery life is incredible, lasting up to 5 days on a single charge. I also appreciate the dual standby SIM feature, which allows me to manage two numbers simultaneously. The color options are vibrant, and the phone's weight is comfortably medium.

"Vivo used to make some really impressive phones, and I even traded in my V9 for this model, only to regret it deeply. Here are the major letdowns:  1) No adapter - Seriously? You pay for a phone and they can’t even include a charging adapter. What a joke! 2) Pathetic sound quality - Good luck hearing your phone ring in a crowded place with its pitiful volume and sound quality. 3) Subpar performance - The phone stutters with medium graphics games and heats up instantly. It’s way below expectations. 4) Call issues galore - Constant call drops (unlike with the V9) and distorted voices make it a nightmare to use for calls. 5) Overpriced - At ₹15k, it's ridiculously overpriced. It shouldn't cost more than ₹8k max (₹5k with discounts). You can find much better options from other brands at this price.  The only thing that's somewhat decent is the appearance, but even that's just okay. The battery life is mediocre, and the camera is nothing to write home about. Don't waste your money on this phone unless it's between ₹5k-₹6k, and even then, think twice!",NEGATIVE

"One word to describe phone... Excellent!!! This phone is superb android phone in this price range. Look wise, it feels premium and is very lightweight. Curved display is very elegant. After using for almost a year, I have zero regret. Camera quality is okish. Battery performance and display are extremely good. The only challenge is to find right screen guard. I initially struggled to find the right screen guard and put it on. However, later I find the perfect screenguard for the phone. Moreover, CPU and high usage doesn't impact it's graphics . The phone never hanged till date. The game performance is also very very nice. I loved this phone.",POSITIVE
"iQOO Z7 Pro 5G is powered by a 4nm processor, the phone is optimized for gaming and demanding tasks, providing efficient performance at this price point. Priced under ₹21,000, this device offers exceptional value with a blend of style and performance.  This smartphone offers an impressive gaming experience, delivering smooth performance with high graphics settings without any noticeable lags—even at critical battery levels as low as 1-5%. The gameplay remains consistent regardless of the charge percentage, ensuring uninterrupted performance.  In terms of connectivity, 5G support works flawlessly, ensuring a seamless network experience. A standout feature of the phone is its curved AMOLED display, which adds an element of sophistication and makes the design visually appealing.  One of the few drawbacks is the battery capacity, which is slightly limited compared to some competitors. However, the device compensates with fast charging support, taking approximately 1 hour and 5 minutes to reach full charge after one year of continuous usage—still a reasonable timeframe.  The camera performance is commendable, offering good results for both casual and advanced photography needs. Although the phone has only a single bottom-firing speaker, it provides satisfactory sound quality for basic usage. This minor limitation does not significantly impact the overall multimedia experience.  Pros:  Outstanding gaming performance with no lag, even at low battery levels Fast charging support (full charge in ~1 hour and 5 minutes) Curved AMOLED display adds a premium feel Smooth 5G connectivity Powerful 4nm processor optimized for gaming  Cons:  Limited battery capacity Single bottom speaker (though audio quality is adequate for everyday use)  Verdict: This smartphone stands out as an excellent choice under ₹21,000, balancing gaming performance, design aesthetics, and fast connectivity. If battery capacity isn't your top priority, it’s a highly recommended option for gamers and casual users alike.",POSITIVE
"After using this phn for past 3 months, I am writing this long time rivew, If you want to buy any phn Under 25K segment there is many option now , there is Moto edge 40Neo , Oneplus Nord CE3 , Realme 11 pro which are decent phones with 1 or 2 cons , It is upto you what is your top 3 preference, for me its Display ,Camera and Processor , Now coming to Iqoo Z7 pro , lets count it pros -  1. Display :- 6.78 inch beautiful Curved AMOLED 120Hz with 1300 nits peak brightness , Screen is very bright , punchy AMOLED colors , Smooth animation , fast UI , and no lagging or frame drop in my usage, also HDR Supported in Youtube Netflix ,Amazon everywhere . Moto Edge 40 Neo has also similar Curved AMOLED with small screen size of 6.55 inches , supports 144Hz and 1300 nits peak brightness with a punchy color science, and HDR only supported in YouTube, not in Netflix or amazon both Oneplus and Realme have peak brightness of only 900 nits and 950 nits respectively , which can be a issue in direct sunlight use , Nord CE 3 is flat AMOLED , not curved  2. Camera : Usually I don't believe in megapixels and numbers , you need a good Rear main camera (64MP OIS) and good front camera (16MP) , which it has , Z7 pro will give you very balanced picture with attractive Social media ready pictures and Best PORTRAIT mode pictures and Best NIGHT Mode pictures in this price range, yes Ultrawide camera is missing , but what will you do with those useless 8MP and 2 MP secondary cameras, if the main camera is not upto the mark , this phone is for my wife , she liked the Front camera also very much .If you love to shoot on Ultrawide camera then go for Edge 40 Neo or Nord CE 3 , Edge 40 neo rear camera is very very over saturated punchy colors , not everyone cup of tea , oneplus camera is also not very eye-catching, Portrait mode edge detection not perfect in any phone except Iqoo, very average camera quality in Oneplus, Megapixel is not everything you can realize after seeing that 100MP main camera in realme, it's very average , for Video every phone has max support upto 4K 30fps with OIS which helps in stable footage, here also Iqoo has the balanced output , Moto has that punchy Saturated colour science, every phone Front camera video support max to 1080p except Edge 40 neo which support 4K30fps , so choose accordingly.  3. Processor - Dimensity 7200 is a very fast processor (very near of Snapdragon 888 and Snapdragon 870) based on Mediatek's 4nm fabrication , which helps not only in Powerful gaming but also in battery consumption, for gamers I will recommend to watch youtube reviews before purchasing , because I did not tested any game, but for my Moderate to heavy use, i never faced any stuttering or heating or lagging , phone is very smooth , fast and responsive with 120Hz always enabled , if you keep refresh rate to auto switch then also it is very smooth. this processor keeps the phone very cool for its Liquid Cooling Vapour chamber.  4. Battery & Charging :- Yes, many people including me has hesitated for 4600mAh , but what a tremendous battery Optimization in this phone ,it will easily beat all the 5000mAh phones in this price range, maybe because of DM 7200 and it's 4nm process , In battery backup it will easily last for 1 day ( 7-8 hours screen on time) in my moderate to heavy use, if you are light normal user than 1.5 day (9-10 hrs SOT) makes it easily better than the any other phones in this price segment , 66W fast charging is also enough for me , I know many people will be looking for more fast charging , but they don't know that fast charging actually harming your phone's battery health. so 66W charging is enough for your phone, It takes 45-50 min to full charge, which is acceptable .  5. Service Center - Many of you already know Iqoo is sub brand of Vivo and it uses all 650+ Vivo service centers all across the country, so after sale services of all Iqoo phones is also very good , I already checked some youtuber all brand service centers reviews , and Vivo Iqoo is always good in that  Now coming to cons, it is neatpicking as cons are very subjective for anyone, it is not a very big issue for everyone ,  1. Ultrawide camera :- If you use Ultrawide camera very much, very frequently then you should avoid this phn , but in this price range most of the phone offers 8MP Ultrawide camera (except Edge 40 Neo 13MP which is also average ,) with inconsistent pictures ,very inaccurate colors , picture will be not sharp , average picture quality, ultrawide camera doesn't offer 4K video recording etc etc..  2. Sound :- It has Mono Speaker which is obviously loud and crystal clear , for those who use phone without headphone or earbuds, Dual speaker is very important nowadays , for me who didn't use dual speaker phone earlier , it is not a big deal , actually I liked this phone speaker as compared to my previous phn, Most of the time i use headphone with my phone , and i don't prefer to disturb others with loud sound of my phone , Edge 40 Neo has best Speaker quality , and Both Oneplus and Realme has dual speaker which has decent output.  3. OS :- Funtouch OS 13 is very improved and stable now as compared last 3-4yrs back , but has many bloatwares (which can be uninstalled), Hot apps and Hot games (which can be diasbled) , one need to turn off the notification of all vivo browser Iqoo services otherwise it can be annoying , but as per twiter and youtube Funtouch OS 14 will come in this phone in next month, which will be bloatware free and will be buttery smooth animation and fast UI experience . Accodring to me my UI Preference will be OxygenOS > MyUX (Moto) > FuntouchOS (for its customization and smooth UI) > RealmeUI (comes with most ad & Bloatwares)  Verdict : - As of now no other phone launches in this price category which is very ahead of this phone , Oneplus Nord CE 3 will be 2nd best choice for me , overall a decent phn in this category but i was looking for Curved AMOLED and best Camera quality which this phn lacks, Edge 40 Neo has very mixed reviews with heating issue and battery issue and so saturated camera output which is not my taste, Realme is a okay okay phone , Good Display but average camera and average performance with ticking all the boxes but a average phn which is not coming top in any department.",NEGATIVE
This phone is very good. I have been rating the mobile for six months. It is a very heavy mobile. Battery is good. Phone charging is full in one hour. 1to 100. Performance is good. Feel like premium. Sound is good. Phone looking is very nice . Thank you iQQ,POSITIVE
"Despite many negative reviews here in amazon quoting heating issues and battery drain, I bought A55 5G after seeing good reviews elsewhere, and I am very happy about the phone. This is one of the best mid range phones ever launched from samsung. Excellent display, smooth UI with AI assist, terrific camera, long lasting battery life, great sound and premium quality looks. I have been using this phone for the last 10 days and never faced any heating issues or battery drain issue. In fact, the battery runs smoothly for two days in normal usage. I am not a gamer, so can't review the performance in that aspect. But the phone tops in all other usages, a beast in the price range, got the 8GB/250GB version for Rs. 25K after exchange and credit card offers and the phone is worth every penny spent.  Pros - Design - metallic side panel & glass back Camera - Excellent UI - smooth AI - wonderful experience Battery - Fabulous Sound - Terrific  Cons - No 3.5 audio jack No rocket launcher installed No inbuilt refrigerator No 109 inch screen No underwater gaming facility No provision for more than 2 SIM cards No special app for samsung haters.  Overall - 5/5  Best samsung phone in A series.",POSITIVE
"The phone has a great body, you would definitely feel like u r holding a top notch premium phone. It is smooth in handling the refresh rate is very good The quality of screen and display is very good and it has awesome speakers they are like top notch. The quality of sound is too good. Coming to camera, its not up to the mark but u will be able to take decent pictures as well in simple words the picture are good not excellent. Front cam is very good. The processor exynos is handling the phone very well giving the smooth seamless experience. It is handling the games also very well huge games like bgmi, cod u will be able to get 40 to 45 fps in smooth extreme mode which is very good. Overall : 1.best body look 2.awesome speakers 3.extraordinary display and sound 4.good camera 5.refreshrate 🔥 6.battery backup is also good 12 hrs minimum.",POSITIVE
"Yes, It it expensive than the other phones available in the market with the same features.  However, It is Samsung, its Camera, Display, build quality, look is really commendable.  Battery drains fast if you don't enable power saver, and using it on Non-dark mode.  Overall great phone, you won't regret buying this one.  Note: Video is captured is almost 6x Zoom level.",POSITIVE
Phone is too good. But the seller has opened the box for some reason and re-packed it and has sold it on Amazon. I have bought so many things from Amazon in the last several years and I completely trust Amazon for any value purchase. But this time I think I have received a used phone. I tried to return and exchange but that's a huge process and I have to run piller to post I visited couple of times and due to time scarcity I just left it. Phone is very good. But I am not getting battery backup... May be I presume it's due to seller issues or Samsung defect???,NEGATIVE
Good Phone.,POSITIVE
"I'm using this mobile past few days it's very smart looking and metal body rear and selfie camera are good quality very nice,no heat issues very fast processing ram very speed performance,I'm try to water testing it's really water and dust resistant overall very good smart phone.i suggested that kindly turn on ram plus bcoz it's affect to system ram speed..thanks to samsung team.",POSITIVE
"This is not a review but a rant. I cannot simply understand why Samsung with all its superb UI and software updates has to compromise on the hardware by providing Exynos line chipsets.  The chipset makes photography inconsistent overall. A below average low light photography performance, inconsistent shots and image processing. The phone heats up much more compared to my three year old Galaxy A71 that has a Snapdragon 730.  45K for a top of the line variant and an Exynos chipset is not how you treat one of your biggest Smartphone markets of the world.  If only Sumsung provided 8 Gen 1 with this device with a price between 45-50K, this could have been the smartphone of the year. The Qualcomm chipset would have handled the heating, image processing and battery management much better and would have held up really well in the long run as Samsung is going to provide 4 years of OS upgrades on this.  This phone would feel warm, even for users like our parents, who spend most of their time on YouTube or Facebook watching Short Videos and Reels. This shouldn't be happening in a device that's worth 45K in today's market.  I don't even want to bring Gaming and Video Editing or rendering into this conversation.  If you want a decent smartphone for light social media consumption, music, 5G, good display and good software and getting good offers on this smartphone, then go for it. Otherwise it doesn't make any sense.  This is probably the last time I have bought Samsung that has an Exynos chipset. I have always loved this brand, my first phone being Samsung Metro 5200. But they are not making any effort to like them anymore.  I hope GOI like USA takes on Samsung for selling below par products in our country at ridiculous prices.  Peace out. 🌸🙏🏼",NEGATIVE
Overall Good balanced phone. Glass and metal build looks premium and feels really good in hand. Good battery life. Excellent display. No heating issue. Good cameras. Haptics nicely combined with software. Superb 5g connectivity. Oneui is amazing. No ads.,POSITIVE
Mobile is very nice and good product Safe delivered Very good Good delivery Fingerprint is very Feel good Storage good Excellent battery Nice display touch,POSITIVE
"This is a good budget mobile phone but it does not have any special specifications. Its camera is okay, its battery backup is good and sometimes it hangs, I don't know why because it has 6 GB RAM but still it hangs. Apart from this, security updates keep coming from time to time, everything else is fine. However, this is all you get at this price, not an iPhone😀. Thank you 😊",NEGATIVE
"Replaced my 5 yrs old Redmi Note 7 pro (6+128gb) with 4+128 version of 13c 5G. The Redmi note 7 pro had costed me 14k and I got 2.8k under exchange plus another 300 as cashback so this 13c costed me effectively 5.9k only. And I Must say for this given price, the phone has not disappointed at all thus far. UI Experience is same and as good as my earlier phone (which I was habitual of), thus was a smooth experience to transition to the new device. Screen quality is super awesome, Camera is just okaish (Below par for a 50MP lens - but you can't ask for an iphone pro max quality at this price), battery is lasting more than 1.5-2 days on a full charge and normal usage as I am not into gaming or other heavy usage. The only con is it takes a good duration of time to charge up. I am using an 18w charger (recommended higher limit) and it takes about 3-4 hrs at min to charge it fully. (Users tend to make a mistake by using higher than recommended chargers in order to charge fast and thus end up damaging their Phones ICs). The charger provided along with the box is standard 10w charger which is useless and I am not using anyways. On the storage, I feel128 gb is more than enough as it was same in my old phone and after using it for 5 years I could use only 90gb of it. For the RAM, again I felt 4 gb should be more than enough as previous 6gb version always showed idle RAM capacity of 3.5-4 GB. And using it till now have not felt any lag or so in normal operations. No heating issues as such. Sound quality is fine. If you are a normal/conservative smartphone user, this is the Best phone you will find under this budget. Even if it lasts another 4-5 years, :) , it would be a complete Paisa vasool. Let's hope it does last that long. And this is also to set an example in an era where people are going crazy/gungho about phones exceeding 1.5lacs with blah blah features, that, if used properly, even a 6k smartphone can serve you equally well ;)",NEGATIVE
"Cons: Charger is just 10w provided so poor charging time, No secondary microphone so No background voice cancellation, OS patching update is slow, Screen is IPS panel i guess, Poor rear camera, No back cover, Bloatwares, ok single speaker, No IR blaster.  Pros: Good looks, Performance is decent with 6gb ram, Battery backup is Good, Display is decent, 3.5mm jack, type C port  Decent phone for parents. But go for better alternative phone’s for better camera, Os updates , good charging support, Amoled display but you need purchase separate type C charger.",NEGATIVE
Best phone at this price. The only problem is phone freezes sometimes in between for 2 to 3 secs or after turning on the internet.,NEGATIVE
"Performance is really good, speed, phone quality is nice, no heating issues , touch is super smooth , looks amazing",POSITIVE
Bought it for my uncle who is living in remote forest area where mobile signal is very feeble. In most of the mobile sets we didn't get the coverage whereas this model working fine with voice call and on net calls. Battery charge is standing for nearly one day and it takes roughly one hour for full charge. The only con is the sound effect is little bit low.,NEGATIVE
"The phone feels great in my hand, shine looks awesome.  Pros: * expandable RAM from 4 GB to 4GB+2GB/4+4 GB or even more * performance is good when upgraded software to hyperOS * Decent battery life for basic to intermediate tasks * Smooth Multitasking * Big Display * Power button as Fingerprint sensor  Cons: * A little heat up is experienced while gaming * Front Selfie Camera is not Great as of our Last Redmi Note Series Phone * Little Laggy for 2-3 minutes just after restarting device afterwards smooth run * Fast charge, but Not quick charging as the Adapter included is of 20W, I used a 30W adapter and is was quickly charging.  I’m impressed with the Design and more over the ram expandable feature which takes memory from storage to expand ram, and you can choose to keep 4GB or expand to 6 or 8 GB as well.",POSITIVE

The sound of the device is not good. When media was downloaded from backup many were not compatible and could not show No proper service backup it was booked about four days back and was promised to resolve it within 24 hrs. Besides the repeated calls no one turnedup and neither the address of service centre was shared. False promises on site and no location of service centre available for pin 122505. The company should take back the product. The makebfalse promises on site and phone. Amazon dhoud not promote such product.

"This Mobile phone has some good features, but some drawback ... 1. Selfie camera video recording mirror problem (recorded opposite) that's software problem/bug. 2. For 10w charger it's takes time 0 - 100% around 3 hrs.(0-90% 2hrs 15mns,90-100% 45 mns) 3. Battery usage time sometimes not showing/wrong showing,that's software problem/bug. 4. After reboot / switch on the lock screen came directly (my previous mobile 4 years old has feature that first input correct pin/password then lock screen came) 5. Other brand mobile (even Android 10/Android 14 4g/5g)app clone/dual app working so many installed app like Amazon etc, but this mobile only works whatsapp, Facebook (not for Facebook lite) 6. Sometimes annonymous call recording symbol missing from screen, that's software problem/bug. 7. Auto Rotation of screen too slow. This post after using 1 month",NEGATIVE
"Lava makes OEM phones for the global market and is one of the largest exporters. But it does not have the jazz of the other leading brands and you may not be able to flaunt this phone if you need a status symbol. But for the tech savvy, this is a great phone worth double it's offer price. So I say it's a silent campaign aiming to sell a quality phone to a quality conscious user. With Android 14, the software brings even greater value to the user.",POSITIVE
Lava O3 pro is a good choice under Rs.7000/- stock Android with out unnecessary apps. I am very much impressed with its display because even under sun light also display is visible. Next one is camera - both captures good pics. I think better in this price point. Battery also gives u one day easily for normal tasks. So any one needs a phone for day to day activities with a good camera please go with this phone. Thank You,POSITIVE
"lava o3(yuva star) is an awesome phone for the price. phone is smooth, battery is good. screen is big and i love it. phone turns off when it reaches 1% battery and u need not to worry like phone is not charging, just plug charger and leave ur phone 2 hours it will turn on. overall phone is awesome...i love this phone❤.",POSITIVE

"The Nokia 105 Classic is a straightforward mobile phone designed for basic communication needs. It features a small color display, physical keypad, dual SIM support, FM radio, and a flashlight. Its focus is on simplicity and reliability.  The standout feature of the Nokia 105 Classic is its exceptional battery life, lasting several weeks on standby. It's easy to use, making it suitable for all age groups. The FM radio adds a nice entertainment option, and the phone's sturdy build quality inspires confidence.  Due to its basic nature, the Nokia 105 Classic lacks internet connectivity and has a limited camera. The small screen size can be challenging for reading text or viewing images. It's not ideal for tasks like web browsing or multimedia.  Considering its low price, the Nokia 105 Classic offers excellent value for money. It's a reliable device for calls and texts, making it a practical choice for those who don't need advanced features.  The Nokia 105 Classic has a simple and compact design with a tactile keypad. It's lightweight and comfortable to hold, with a durable construction that feels solid.  - The phone's dual SIM support allows users to manage two phone numbers simultaneously, which is convenient for those who need separate numbers for work and personal use. - The inclusion of a flashlight is handy for emergencies or when additional light is needed in dark environments.  In conclusion, the Nokia 105 Classic is a basic mobile phone that excels in providing essential communication features. It's a reliable and affordable option for those who prefer a simple device for calls and texts. While it lacks the features of smartphones, its long battery life and ease of use make it a practical choice for many users.",POSITIVE
Nice product. User friendly,POSITIVE
Bought this phone in July 2024. Unfortunately the phone doesn't charge and I'm unable to reach any product support through Amazon. This is still under warranty.,NEGATIVE
"Its a great phone and exceeds my expectations in terms of usability and features. I needed a non-smart phone for two numbers. Phone should be small in size, lightweight, with clear reception, long battery life, loud ringtone, and unobtrusive interface (and no camera). This phone provides all that. Only time will tell the durability aspect. Go for it if that's your requirement as well.",NEGATIVE
Nice product and good packing,POSITIVE

"I have purchased this product for 20k without any card discounts in june 2024. And the entire review will be relative to that price point.  Box contents include a good quality silicone case, 80 watt charger with red colour cable, red club card(though I found it to be useless), oneplus & nord branding stickers alongwith the smartphone.  I will start with the cons first which is the battery backup, that feels slightly less, idle drain is a bit fast as well but it ain't a deal breaker. The phone heats up a bit as well in long sessions.  For everything else this smartphone is the best choice under 20k without any doubts.  It has a fantastic 1.5k, 120hz adequately bright & responsive 10 bit amoled display.  The performance is top notch considering the price as it has dimensity 9000 which is similar to 8+gen 1 and it also has very fast lpddr5 Ram and ufs 3.1 storage. No phone under 20k is even close to this beast.  The charging is pretty fast as well with the 80 watt charger, reaches about 85-90% from 1% in just 30 mins. I use it for WhatsApp, shopping apps, banking/trading apps and YouTube And the battery provides about 6.30-7.00 hrs SOT and lasts for about a day before it dies with 50% wifi and 50% 5g single sim usage. I use black theme, 60hz refresh rate, with low volume on loud speakers and have good 5g signal strength most of the time.  The stereo speakers alongwith Dolby Atmos are above average in terms of quality & loudness.  I haven't tested the cameras extensively but they seem to be above average.  The build quality is premium as well with glad build and thin bezels  The software is good too with minimum bloatware and 0 ads, its fluid and majorly bug free with a couple of useful features. You will get updates till Android 16.  Overall highly recommended.",POSITIVE
"Update after about 2 Months of Usage: I stick to the initial impressions on the Display and Battery Life. This oneplus device is excellent on these 2 aspects. I read some review about battery not lasting long enough. But I did not face any issues. It easily lasts for 24 Hrs - for medium-high usage. Charging speed is very good, about 30 to 40 Mins to reach 100 from 20. One more positive thing about camera - is the video recording. Excellent reproduction of visuals and sound. Performance is very good as I load heavy Apps related to work; it supports multi-tasking like screen sharing and AV calling while running background apps simultaneously. --------------------------------------------- About cons - Not much but very small niggles. Sometimes screen refresh doesnt happen even after the app is closed, esp. when media plays in a browser. And the back glossy panel attracts fingerprints.  All in all a decent purchase and I am a happy user. Thanks! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- I got this phone delivered the next day of ordering, as part of prime day sale. Writing this review after few days of use. Well the first impression about the back panel color is - it's blue rather than green! nevertheless it looks cool and feels premium. The glass finish is shiny, but I would recommend to use the rubber back cover that comes with the box. But you might have to invest to buy a transparent, bumper cover in the long run. Display - It is awesome as I keep looking the phone just to admire the different wall papers and text settings, etc. Colors are deep and rich! Almost zero bloatware. Battery - For a mild to medium user like me(about 3 Hrs of active usage), the battery has lasted for more than 24 Hrs. Also the fast charger works as expected. Full charge in less than an hour. Audio - Yes, I do miss the 3.5MM Jack especially as my old phone had that feature. However, the call quality through the device and through the BT earphones are ultra clear. No default music player app provided as in Samsung devices, but YT music/Spotify can fulfill your music needs. Hearing songs through built in speakers was good It comes with other bells and whistles like - favorite contacts widget, customizable always-on-display and in-display fingerprint sensor , battery saving mode, etc. I particularly like the fingerprint animation settings. Performance - well for my moderate usage I have not faced any problems so far. Stutter free scrolling, and apps are getting loaded in a jiffy and all the apps work smoothly; notifications work very well. Videos played well. Actually, nothing to complain here in these few days of usage. Camera - Honestly not able to test it in different conditions, but both day and night photos seem to come out well. Video calls quality is also great. Also, the phone does not feel heavy to hold. Even people with small hands should not have a problem in holding and operating the phone. I hope I can write a detailed review after few weeks of thorough usage. Thanks!",POSITIVE
"For the price of 8k (after deducting the discounts), you are getting a good 5G phone. Very good battery backup - 10 on 10. very good display - 7 on 10. Single speaker - 6 on 10. Excellent call quality with strong 5G connectivity. in sim settings disable the smart 5g option to get strong 5g network. A must buy for everyone having low budget.",POSITIVE

"I've been using the Samsung Feature phones for over 15 years. Still, I am using it. So, I am writing this review by comparing with Samsung feature phones.  1. Build: HMD has nailed it. Though Samsung feature phones are looks slim it feels weight in our hands. But this HMD looks bulk than the Samsung Feature phones but it's very light weight. And the body is fully plastic. I feel it's very thin than my Samsung feature phones. So, there's a high chance to get broken if we drop it.  2. Display: I won't complaint the display and it's brightness for this price. I have no issues when using outdoors.  3. Battery: Will update this soon. Because using for the past 5 days since I switched on the device without charging it.  4. Call: Started using BSNL Sim. Haven't faced any network issues. I think the signal reception on this HMD 105 is far superior to the Samsung Feature Phone. When coming to call quality, I didn't face any issues.  Only thing is loudspeaker when speaking on call. It's not so loud unlike the ringing tones or music player loudness. I feel like using without speaker is sounds good even if we keep the phone away from ears.  5. Software: Another area where I am not fully satisfied. Because it's not very user-friendly. There's 1 alarm tone but we can't adjust the volume of the alarm. There's 1 wallpaper and if we want to change then we have to choose it from the SD Card. There's 3 message tones and 5 ringtones. If we have to use other tones, we have to go to Files, to choose from SD Card. Can't choose right from the respective tones page.  It's not easy for everyone to navigate to SD card to choose their desired tones. But message and ringing tones volume can be adjustable.  UPI is available. But I haven't used it yet.  6. Extras: - KEYPAD: It's rubber. Feels soft. Very responsive. My biggest concern is the main button 🔳 which helps to select. It's not protruding upwards as in the Samsung Feature Phones. And it's surrounded by the protruding navigation keys which makes it difficult to use the select option. But you may not feel like that. - TORCH: Very brighter than Samsung Feature Phones - SPEAKER: It's killer one. Didn't expect this much loudness from this HMD 105. Very loud than the Samsung Feature phones. Whether it's an alarm or ringing or message or music player or fm radio, the sound is more than enough. But I don't understand why the same loudness is not available when we use handsfree option on phone calls. - FM RADIO: Works without audio jack - AUDIO JACK: 3.5mm jack is there - SD CARD: I am using 4GB SD card and chose the message, ringing and alarm tone from the cards. Also, we have basic file manager options such as move, copy, rename, properties Micro - USB: It's 2024. So HMD could've given a USB-C.  My concerns are loudness of handsfree phone calls, select button 🔳 and UI where we can't choose tones right from the respective page itself and can't control the volume of an alarm ⏰.",NEGATIVE
3rd Oct purchased for my father.... i really fed-up and feel why i purchased this...  worst UI... even 600 rs mobile was better than this... very average battery standby....  you can't put loudspeaker while call.... there is no outside speaker.....  Don't buy this creepy phone.... go some other best brand.....,NEGATIVE
Charger is not Type-C and it is Micro USB Type. Body colour is great. The buttons feel wonderful. 4G and 3G SIM doesn't work as it supports only 2G. Airtel 4G SIM works nicely as Airtel 4G is compatible with 2G handset. Jio 4G doesn't work. There is no camera. Volume is crystal clear. Very light weight and easy to carry. It provides a very uncomplicated interface and it is perfect for digital detoxification. Snake is there. Call recording is there but for that to work SD card has to be installed. UPI payment interface is also there.,POSITIVE
"Phone is light weight, stylish and compact. Using Bsnl sim. Call connectivity is good.Torch light is bright enough and FM tunes really well. But battery drains fast. No Kannada language support, call volume sound is too high and no separate battery folder in the menu list. Liked the phone for the price.",NEGATIVE

Gifted this to my father. The phone size and looks are upto the mark. Has a big screen which makes it quite readable. The phone is also loud. All in all a value for money product.,POSITIVE
Very nice mobile Easy to handle & access Beautiful appearance Very ease to carry.  Thank you so much to itel,POSITIVE
No quality waste of money,POSITIVE
"I have been using it for two weeks as my secondary phone. This device has great built and the quality of materials used is very good.  Some features: ------------------  1. It is 2g phone, with 2 sim slots and a memory card slot  2. Keypad is backlit with good tactile feedback.  3. Bluetooth works very well with a headset  4. Camera is a gimmick, however, the torch/flash is good  5. Cellular reception is good and call quality is reasonably OK. Speaker sound quality is great, however, the volume is on the lower side.  BATTERY LIFE is the single weak link of this phone. It will give at the most 1.5 to 2 days if you use it less, otherwise 1 day. On the other hand, it charges quickly enough to make up for its feeble battery life.  I still highly recommended this device as the design looks fresh, feature set is good and built quality is great especially the backside.  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =",POSITIVE
"*The Good:*  - *Build Quality:* The phone has a solid build quality that feels premium in the hand. keypad also very good, like a premium one. - *Attractive Design:* The design is sleek and attractive, making it a head-turner. - *Good Quality Screen:* The screen is one of the highlights of the phone, with good color reproduction and clear text. - *Battery Life:* The battery life is more than enough to last a day, even with heavy usage.  *The Not-So-Good:*  - *Poor Call Voice Quality:* Unfortunately, the call voice quality is poor, even in loudspeaker mode. The speaker quality seems subpar, making voices sound muffled and unclear, even at 50% volume.  Overall, the Itel Circle 1 is a decent phone with some notable strengths, but the poor call voice quality is a major letdown. If you're looking for a phone primarily for calling, you might want to consider other options. However, if you're looking for a budget phone with a good screen and battery life, the Itel Circle 1 might still be worth considering.",NEGATIVE

My previous phone was lava blaze 5g... Thats damaged due to water damage..so i bought lava storm 5g.. Its a nice phone.. Looks premium but its heavy.. Due to back glass.. 120hz display is very good..

"I purchased this because I am an ardent supporter of Made in India, also because I was attracted by many features ""mentioned to confuse"" people. It's battery went down by 8% overnight when it was kept with internet turned off. It was written 8+8 gb but I got 8+6 gb. What's more Customer service is so pathetic, they said we can't help even though it was in return period and I got the wrong product, Lava customer service does not even takes the call. I have learned my lesson an I am not purchasing from Amazon anymore.",NEGATIVE

I Purchased Lava Strom 5G Smartphone almost a Month ago for My Sister and Mother And It's A Best Budget 5G phone Which Comes under The Price Range Of 10-12K At Present Phone Is Working Properly no Problem at All I Highly Recommend this Indian Brand Smartphone to Others 🇮🇳♥️💯🤗🙏🏻,POSITIVE
"The only Indian smartphone brand which survives and proudly rising in the era of Chinese bombs. In the last few year I have ordered three different Lava smartphones and all are working very good without any issue. It has a larger display than other mobiles. The only thing it has to improve is its camera. Otherwise it is a very good budget smartphone in the present time. It's for better than realme, redmi, oppo, Vivo, Poco in the same budget",POSITIVE
Lava is actually making a good mobiles in budget overall Mobile quality is good 😊. Battery Life is also good (5/5) Display is large and quality is very good (5/5) Camera quality is not so good because company tells that they are offering 50MP Rear Camera but actually it provide only 12MP Rear Camera (2.5/5) Functionality is good can handle multiple apps in one time.,POSITIVE
Excellent power services. Power consumption is very less. Battery charging very quick. Performance is very good in comparison to device's price. Taking into account of sounds brightness display quality etc overall performance is commendable. A good product.,POSITIVE
"I don’t have words to explain the quality of camera, only can say it is pathetic, poor, disgusting etc. I have connected with their team also and they told me that they can’t do any thing as camera will provide this type of pic only. I will suggest please don’t buy Redmi Note 14 mobile it is totally wastage of money and they are fooling by saying it is 50mp camera; however my old mobile provide better pic. I am going to request to Amazon also please don’t keep these type of low standard product which are costing so much. I am never going to buy electronic product from Amazon because if quality of product is not good u can’t return it and ur hard earned money will go to waste and will suggest my family and friends also not to buy electronic product from Amazon.",NEGATIVE

"Price bought at: ₹249  This is my 3rd mobile mount from Portronics. There is a reason why I always to go Portronics for mobile mounting solution. They have all been great.  Clamp M1 has been great for over 2 years until its spring mechanism gave up. Clamp M2 is the current one in my car. Bought this as alternative for M2 as this has less moving parts and takes relatively less space.  Note: I drive an Alto 800 whose windshield inclination is less than that of SUVs. This isn't allowing me to mount my S23Ultra due to the windshield inclination and the size of the phone itself. I tried both on dashboard and windshield, neither worked for me and I had to return it sticking to clamp M2.  As the inclination of Windshield is more in SUVs, this might fit well in them. Or in case of HBs or Sedans which has deeper dashboard, that may also be a compatible case. In my case I could use it only in landscape mode which I am not a huge fan of.  Pros: Sturdy build. Unibody design. Wide range of screen size compatibility. One touch release mechanism (trust me, I have been using this mechanism on clamp M1 and it has been great for one handed use until it broke after 2 years of everyday use).  Cons: This particular model might be incompatible with larger phones in Hatchbacks and Sedans. I literally don't have anything else to complain.  Verdict: If you have a deeper dashboard or near vertical windshield, then this will serve you well. If you own Alto 800 avoid this unless you use your phone in landscape all the time.",NEGATIVE
"The important thing to note with this clamp is - the design of the clamp is such that it fits on the dashboard nicely. It is not suitable to fit on the windscreen, since the arm has only one degree of freedom. Also the arm length from the suction pump is short, so suitable for dashboard and not long enough for to hold the phone from the windscreen. The suction is strong and also has a sticky base, which is quite helpful. The arm has a tightning screw that is quite helpful. Overall, good value for money if the design fits your needs.",POSITIVE
"The **Portronics Car Mobile Holder** is a sturdy and reliable accessory for daily use. Its easy rotation allows for smooth adjustments between portrait and landscape modes. The holder securely grips your phone and stays in place even on bumpy roads. A great choice for anyone looking for a durable, functional, and convenient car phone mount.",POSITIVE
"Adhesion-moderate(good only in case of glass). Material-good. Locking-attaching system-good. As a mobile holder-moderate(vibration resulting slipping of mobile). Other points-can charge mobile phone keeping there,can rotate mobile phone easily,price is a little bit high. Overall-8/10",POSITIVE
Built quality is good sturdy but the main suction is bad so no use. I mount it on glass but still comes of again and again…..,NEGATIVE
"1. It is mostly used for cars and others, but I am using it for my r15v3. The build quality is very satisfying it gives premium feel. 2. The phone holder holds the phone firmly But as I am using it on my bike there's a little shake, still we can trust it if u use small sized phone(4-5.5mm screen) it handles greatly. 3 IF we use in cars then it can bear any phone 4 Even I'm using it on bike the suction Cup holds still without problem 5 It is a value for money product. U will satisfied in cars but as like me if you use it on bike it may or may not reach ur expectations That's up to you 6 Lastly with this product I'm much happy with my rides 7 it is easy to install, the fit and design are upto the mark&Adjustments are also quite impressive 8 hope you got the required information Thank you 😊",POSITIVE
"I have used it and its pretty good. Please note there is adhesion plus suction mechanism for the holder, together provides strong grip. Even with adhesion I was able to pull out from glass shield thereby could change places suitable while driving. Avoid on dashboard if its not flat / is textured. It will be able to hold there but may not for long. Happy with the product",POSITIVE

"I recently bought the Sounce Mobile Stand Holder, and it’s been a game-changer for my daily routine! The metal build feels sturdy and durable, easily holding my phone in place without any wobble. It’s perfect for online classes, watching videos, or even working at my desk. The multi-angle adjustability makes it super convenient to find the perfect viewing angle. I also love that it’s flexible yet heavy-duty, making it reliable for long hours of use. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a quality phone stand!",POSITIVE
According to the price range The build quality of this mobile stand is great and durability is fantastic GREAT JOB 👍,POSITIVE
"Good product, the bendable part holds it's shape pretty good. The only problem is with how it is attached to its clamp. The nut fastened to the string comes loose in a few months. Other than that if the product is attached to a sturdy surface it doesn't wobble that much.",POSITIVE
"The quality of clamps need to be better, the rod is heavy and sturdy but the clamp is not strong enough to hold it tightly.",NEGATIVE
It is good for light uses and good in tha price of 200 . Over Quality is good .,POSITIVE
"The Mobile Stand Holder is a game-changer! Its sturdy metal build gives it a premium feel, and the adjustable angles make it perfect for everything—whether you're watching movies, attending online classes, or just browsing. The clamp is super easy to use and keeps your phone secure without worrying about scratches. I love how versatile it is; I can use it on my desk, bed, or even on my bike. It’s practical, durable, and worth every penny!",POSITIVE
"Both clip are of good quality, spring wire is hard as required, superb quality vale for money, Area to improve: mobile hanging clip should also be metalic.",POSITIVE
Overall quality seems Ok. Only problem is it bends with weight of mobile.,POSITIVE
Value for money,POSITIVE
I brought this phone for my mother. Smart AI feature is superb like reading the incoming call etc. You can custize the features. I am using BSNL sim. Good connectivity.Clear sound. Even the bol feature can be fine tuned. The phone is extremely light weight. When battery is full the charging indication moving icon stops.,NEGATIVE
Don't Think Too Much Just Buy it If You Want Basic Keypad Mobile Phone.,NEGATIVE
Battery backup is very poor,NEGATIVE
Happy with the product quality and build. Battery life is very good in single charge. Clear voice quality for caller and receiver. Simple to use for those who are not Android users and want for calling and listening to music. You can add a 32GB memory card and enjoy. One thing missing is bluetooth connectivity. Worth buying for the price.,NEGATIVE
Looking cool & worth to spend 800 bucks on,POSITIVE
Actually the build is good slim and lite weight and does all other functionalities well. Good speaker output and battery backup (3days normal use) .,POSITIVE
Thanks,POSITIVE
"Sound quality loud, design impressive, multiple launguage option, very good 👍",POSITIVE

Very good product,POSITIVE

"Totally unexpected one..the build quality is very good. I love the length of the selfie stick, it was like it is made for me(especially for 6 feet guys this is a masterpiece). Maybe it's not pocket friendly to carry other then that it was good. The remote is working perfectly. The handle grip and the stability of the selfie is great... At last for this price Rs. 650 this is sick!!!! 170cm ofl extended height and premium look finishing at this price is really great. I'm impressed with this product... I would give a 10/10✨",POSITIVE
This is the best and budget friendly stand that you carry easily.,POSITIVE
"I have been using this product for a while now, and love the quality and built available at this price",POSITIVE
"This is great for now I don't know what was the quality before or will be after, but quality is great now . The length is around 1 meter, it's stable upto the top length but becomes unstable after top height great to shoot . Great to shoot study videos",POSITIVE
Quality is fine,POSITIVE
"It's very good for the price given. Less than a meter tall at full length but it's okay what can you expect at this range also it's quite difficult to balance on bed as it has short legs and does not cover much area. But for selfies, wifi controlled shots, and video recording, vlogging it's great. Reduces camera movement that you feel when held in hand.",POSITIVE
I think it's the best tripod or selfie stick in this price it's remote control works very properly and is able to record videos and capture photos and can stop recording as well it's very small and easily fits in your pocket and its height is around 60 CM which is good for vlogging and selfies,POSITIVE
"It's quite small, lightweight and handy. The remote has a removable battery, not rechargeable. When phone is attached the stand might wobble based on phone's weight. The clamp to hold phone is soft might break easily but as the title says it does the job. For 299 it's a good deal.",POSITIVE
Good quality phone stand. I bought the white colour and it looks good. Can support ipad or tablets too. Good thing is that the position can be adjusted and folded as per need. I bought it a long time back and it has survived all the abuses of being thrown and crushed by the kids. It's small and very easy to use. I bought only one piece and I recommend to buy at least two because it's not that expensive and it tends to get lost in the house sometimes when you have kids around.,NEGATIVE
"Quite sturdy and practical. No problem.  Just one minor suggestion, it should have some sort of a rubber/felt base to avoid scratches on surfaces as it is hard plastic",NEGATIVE
Extremely useful for me. I keep this on my desk to place my phone easily accessible.,POSITIVE
"For simple function only . Last long . Cannot do rotate, tilt,up-down",NEGATIVE
At this price it's quality is top notch.,POSITIVE
Good quality product & looking nice under ₹150,POSITIVE
"Absolutely fantastic product, very sturdy.",POSITIVE
one of the stands broke although it works well with the different positions and also my phones screen sensor detects it as a touch so its kind a hard to touch and use the screen whieon the stand but overall really useful and nice,POSITIVE
This product is of exceptional quality and is well worth its price. I have already ordered a second item within two weeks. It is remarkably stable on a table and remains in a specific position without any difficulty. .,POSITIVE
"looks sturdy, heavy. Good stability on hard surface. Holds phone. No Charging hindernce. Flexible rotations, no imbalance issue. Thoughtfully designed.",POSITIVE
Overall a good product. But one problem is it drops down when Phone is kept too forward.,NEGATIVE

"The KINGONE Long Selfie Stick with Tripod Stand is a great choice for anyone who loves taking photos or making videos.

The 360° rotation makes adjusting the angle super simple, whether you’re shooting in portrait or landscape mode.

"Easily competes with 12-15k phones from Realme; comes with some bloatware which can easily be removed. Highly recommended for new android users as well as those seeking a quality phone for a low price. You can easily extend storage (flash) to 1TB by buying an SDXC card, and preferably buying the 128GB variant. Haven't faced much heating issues, but would edit this review after 1,3,6 months of usage.",NEGATIVE
"Overall this phone is good but there is one drawback that is its front camera which is not good, selfie is not clear.",NEGATIVE
"Look wise good , big display good battery backup",POSITIVE
"It seems phone is launched in very hurry without seeing how other apps like banking particularly open in phone. All banking apps do not open with proper UI and user can not use as button, text are not aligned / visible.  It is complete nightmare to setup phone as I lost important data while migrating old Redmi phone to this new phone and once I see apps are not working then back to old phone.

"I recently tried the Ambrane Mobile Stand, and I find it to be very useful! The adjustable design allows me to customize the viewing angle to my preference, making it perfect for video calls, streaming, or reading. The versatility in adjustments is definitely a highlight for me.  However, there is one significant drawback: the stand struggles to maintain its position at certain angles. Specifically, it tends to fall when adjusted between 45° and 60°, which can be quite frustrating during use.  Overall, the Ambrane Mobile Stand is a solid choice for its flexibility and convenience, but I hope to see improvements in stability to make it truly reliable at all angles.",POSITIVE

Highly recommend it for hassle-free photography!",POSITIVE
I bought it for my smartphone and I feel it's totally worth the purchase. The led light comes with micro usb port and not c port. However I knew it before purchasing. The product sits steady as a tripod. It's light weight. The stick length is not too long and I find it as a great product for the price it's better than recording by holding phone in hand as it provides more stability.its also small when contracted.  Update after 10 days The product is in excellent condition the light is good enough for mild light in night.the stick is pretty comfortable to use.,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased a gimbal from Amazon, and I couldn't be more thrilled with my experience. This gimbal has completely transformed the way I capture videos, and it's hands down one of the best investments I've made for my photography and videography needs.  **Stability and Smoothness** The most remarkable feature of this gimbal is its stability. Even when walking, running, or shooting in crowded environments, the footage remains incredibly smooth. It feels like I'm using professional-grade equipment, yet it's lightweight and easy to carry around. The gimbal's motors are powerful and responsive, ensuring that even sudden movements don't cause unwanted shakes or jitters.  **Ease of Use** Setting up the gimbal was straightforward, thanks to the clear instructions and intuitive design. The balancing process took just a few minutes, and the controls are very user-friendly. I love the versatility of the gimbal—it has multiple modes for different shooting styles, and switching between them is a breeze.  **Battery Life and Connectivity** The battery life is outstanding. I can shoot for hours without worrying about recharging, which is perfect for longer shoots or all-day events. The gimbal also offers various connectivity options, allowing me to control it remotely via an app on my phone. This feature is fantastic for getting creative with shots and angles.  **Additional Features** I was pleasantly surprised by the extra features, such as object tracking and time-lapse capabilities. These added functionalities open up a whole new world of creative possibilities, making the gimbal even more versatile.  **Value for Money** Considering the build quality, features, and performance, this gimbal offers exceptional value for money. It's a must-have for anyone serious about videography or content creation. Whether you're a professional or just starting out, this gimbal will take your videos to the next level.  In summary, I highly recommend this gimbal to anyone looking to improve their video quality. It's durable, reliable, and incredibly easy to use. If you're in the market for a gimbal, look no further—this one is a winner!",POSITIVE
"I was astonished with all its features and ease of usage. Got it at an effective price as well. Grip is solid, build quality is superb, stabilization is again very good. What else to say. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
Good product 👍,POSITIVE
"Pros Compact and foldable design Smooth three-axis stabilization Affordable price point Easy-to-use interface Magnetic phone clamp for quick setup ActiveTrack 5.0 for reliable subject tracking Cons Lacks the extra features of higher-end models Battery life could be longer for prolonged shooting Some functions rely heavily on the DJI Mimo app, which may not appeal to those who prefer native phone controls",NEGATIVE
Thard quality matirial,NEGATIVE
It is good qualiry and built value for money,POSITIVE
"Initially, I received an open box which was sealed by just a tape. Inside it the phone clamp was missing. No phone could be attached to the gimbal and so it was useless product. Amazon customer care couldn't help, however the replacement option was available so opted for that.  The replacement seems to work fine.  The instructions are missing so have to searched online to understand the basic functionality. The gimbal is quite responsive and works as expected. Quite frequently on switching on, the phone appears tilted and so I am forced to calibrate using the tripod and dji app everytime I switch it on which is a pain considering that a flat surface may not be available always. The gimbal works with the dji app and its camera but not with the default camera app of my phone.  Apart from the above complaints, it is a good product and stabilizes the phone well. Good portable option for phone videography.",POSITIVE
"Easy to use, worth the money",POSITIVE
Smooth in taking selfies. Very stable and handy. Very friendly user and worth the price! Handy and cutie! ❤️,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the DJI Osmo Mobile SE Gimbal Stabilizer, and I must say, it has significantly elevated my mobile videography and photography experience. Right out of the box, the build quality stands out: the gimbal feels sturdy yet remains lightweight enough for everyday carry. The foldable design is both travel-friendly and practical, allowing me to slip it into my backpack without any trouble.",POSITIVE
I love this and it is so convenient to use and not heavy.,POSITIVE
This product is highly recommended the quality and fit of the product is just amazing and upto the mark…,POSITIVE
"This product is budget-friendly and delivers as expected, though minor improvements could enhance its performance. Despite its sturdy grip, it tends to wobble when holding a mobile phone. However, the build quality is commendable and feels durable.",POSITIVE
Watch charger. And has a mobile phone stand too. Good buy at the price point.,POSITIVE
"Don't buy, the product is very different as shown in images. The base filled with white kind of dust, which spill gradually and decrease the fit and finish of product itself and durability. When I open the product. A white dust appear on whole surface.",NEGATIVE
Product in good condition but full dust inside the packaging box.,NEGATIVE
Super Product,POSITIVE
"This phone holder offers a good balance of cost and quality. Design wise it's standard design of decent quality. It's ease to assemble once you know how it looks like. Functionally it does a decent job. Size is about 33cms in height. The base could benefit from added grip for increased stability. Overall, it presents a commendable option for holding your phone securely and is quite practical accessory. Size - 33 cm length",POSITIVE
Good product. Easy to install. Only draw back is there was installation manual or an image on the box how to fix the parts. I had to refer to the product on the Amazon.,POSITIVE
This works well as a charging station and the cord has a place to be. It's good for Facetime and my hands don't get tired holding the phone just so. It's adjustable so you can have it on your desk and still talk hands-free. It's a good value and looks far better than the price tag would suggest. It's got heft and is designed to last for years.,POSITIVE
"This stand has revolutionized my use of my phone. I love it. I used to have a case with a little thing you could pull out to make it stand, but it always felt precarious, and would often fall over, if I could get it to stand properly in the first place. This one is solid, steady, heavy in a good way, I can put it on a mattress or an uneven pile of papers (within limits, of course), and not feel like it'll topple over. The non-slip surfaces underneath the stand and where the phone rests keep everything in place nicely. The angle is easily adjustable so I can watch it while cooking or while lying on the floor doing physio. This is a product I'm way more excited about than I expected, especially for such an apparently simple design.",POSITIVE
"Worth buying for 7k. Specially the in-built background streaming feature. Backgeound streaming, expandable RAM, Modification in screen refresh rate, Camera quality these features at this cost is amazing.",POSITIVE
Stock smooth android Phone quality is quite good Battery life is also good Smoothness performance Sound is quite decent And display seems Bright Overall at this price range it's Worth it,POSITIVE
The sound of the device is not good. When media was downloaded from backup many were not compatible and could not show No proper service backup it was booked about four days back and was promised to resolve it within 24 hrs. Besides the repeated calls no one turnedup and neither the address of service centre was shared. False promises on site and no location of service centre available for pin 122505. The company should take back the product. The makebfalse promises on site and phone. Amazon dhoud not promote such product. It is not as per the standard quality and compatibilty of the Android phone. Mr kushal verma and Mr. Deshwal claimed to be their authorised service partendr never kept their promise. Please take back the product . Supply the fully comptible Android phone,NEGATIVE
Best at this price range i refer it.,POSITIVE
Truly good phone in this price in comparison to mobiles having price 16000,POSITIVE
"This Mobile phone has some good features, but some drawback ... 1. Selfie camera video recording mirror problem (recorded opposite) that's software problem/bug. 2. For 10w charger it's takes time 0 - 100% around 3 hrs.(0-90% 2hrs 15mns,90-100% 45 mns) 3. Battery usage time sometimes not showing/wrong showing,that's software problem/bug. 4. After reboot / switch on the lock screen came directly (my previous mobile 4 years old has feature that first input correct pin/password then lock screen came) 5. Other brand mobile (even Android 10/Android 14 4g/5g)app clone/dual app working so many installed app like Amazon etc, but this mobile only works whatsapp, Facebook (not for Facebook lite) 6. Sometimes annonymous call recording symbol missing from screen, that's software problem/bug. 7. Auto Rotation of screen too slow. This post after using 1 month",NEGATIVE
"Lava makes OEM phones for the global market and is one of the largest exporters. But it does not have the jazz of the other leading brands and you may not be able to flaunt this phone if you need a status symbol. But for the tech savvy, this is a great phone worth double it's offer price. So I say it's a silent campaign aiming to sell a quality phone to a quality conscious user. With Android 14, the software brings even greater value to the user.",POSITIVE
Lava O3 pro is a good choice under Rs.7000/- stock Android with out unnecessary apps. I am very much impressed with its display because even under sun light also display is visible. Next one is camera - both captures good pics. I think better in this price point. Battery also gives u one day easily for normal tasks. So any one needs a phone for day to day activities with a good camera please go with this phone. Thank You,POSITIVE
This phone not only looks good but works flawlessly. The smooth scrolling and fast 5G make it a great purchase!,POSITIVE
"For the price, this phone offers everything you need. The design is sleek, and the performance is reliable. Definitely worth buying!",POSITIVE
Very stylish and good looking performance of phone is good no hanging and battery is also good overall excellent,POSITIVE
This phone works great for social media apps. Smooth scrolling and quick loading times make it a pleasure to use.,POSITIVE
"✅Comes with default Xiomi dialer so call recording feature is a huge plus point. One may never know when it's needed.  ✅Bigger screen size: This has its own advantage and disadvantage. Good to use for elders when font size is increased on a already bigger screen size phone. Safe hand to eye distance can be easily achieved. ❌Issue is that bigger size bigger battery makes it bulky (keep in mind back cover will also add overall weight slightly). One hand use is risky because handling might become difficult for few people.  ✅Battery backup: Not sure how much Xiomi has worked on battery backup but so far it's looking decent hopefully it stays this way in future as well. (Only other Redmi phone I used was their debut model in India 'Redmi 1S' that was launched way back 10 years ago and it wasn't so good on battery backup)  ✅Updates: Received first update (security patch) today as I write this review.  ✅ Charging speed is definitely good.  ❌Storage: custom UI phones lack in this. Unnecessary apps, tweaks and customisation eat up system space. I've literally kept this phone as received it 2 weeks ago. No data saved so far and already 23 GB system space is full. 128 internal space in budget segment phones should now be default given size of apps and never ending updates.  🤷🏽Can't comment on 5G since I don't have jio connection. 4G is working fine. ❌Separate budget for screen protector and back cover.  Bought this for my mum so good for basic usage. Received this phone on 4th December 2024 so I believe 2 weeks period is still not enough to give final review.",NEGATIVE
"The Redmi A4 5G is stylish, functional, and affordable. It ticks all the right boxes for me.",POSITIVE
"1.Regular Motorola user, bought three phones for parents and relative. 2.Redmi UI is super fast with lots of customization options and minimal bloatware. 3.Camera and speaker are excellent; calling works in closed areas. 4.Display is fluid. 5.Phones work superbly, but only Jio 5G works; Airtel 5G does not work. Airtel 4G works. 6.Airtel 5G may work in the future if they launch a standalone network. 7.Same phone available on Flipkart as Poco C75 5G for 8K. 8.Prefer Redmi over Poco due to past hanging issues with Poco phones. 9.Redmi phones rarely hang, even with 2GB/16GB configuration.",POSITIVE

"Price bought at: ₹249  This is my 3rd mobile mount from Portronics. There is a reason why I always to go Portronics for mobile mounting solution. They have all been great.  Clamp M1 has been great for over 2 years until its spring mechanism gave up. Clamp M2 is the current one in my car. Bought this as alternative for M2 as this has less moving parts and takes relatively less space.  Note: I drive an Alto 800 whose windshield inclination is less than that of SUVs. This isn't allowing me to mount my S23Ultra due to the windshield inclination and the size of the phone itself. I tried both on dashboard and windshield, neither worked for me and I had to return it sticking to clamp M2.  As the inclination of Windshield is more in SUVs, this might fit well in them. Or in case of HBs or Sedans which has deeper dashboard, that may also be a compatible case. In my case I could use it only in landscape mode which I am not a huge fan of.  Pros: Sturdy build. Unibody design. Wide range of screen size compatibility. One touch release mechanism (trust me, I have been using this mechanism on clamp M1 and it has been great for one handed use until it broke after 2 years of everyday use).  Cons: This particular model might be incompatible with larger phones in Hatchbacks and Sedans. I literally don't have anything else to complain.  Verdict: If you have a deeper dashboard or near vertical windshield, then this will serve you well. If you own Alto 800 avoid this unless you use your phone in landscape all the time.",NEGATIVE
"The important thing to note with this clamp is - the design of the clamp is such that it fits on the dashboard nicely. It is not suitable to fit on the windscreen, since the arm has only one degree of freedom. Also the arm length from the suction pump is short, so suitable for dashboard and not long enough for to hold the phone from the windscreen. The suction is strong and also has a sticky base, which is quite helpful. The arm has a tightning screw that is quite helpful. Overall, good value for money if the design fits your needs.",POSITIVE

"I have used it and its pretty good. Please note there is adhesion plus suction mechanism for the holder, together provides strong grip.

"I recently purchased the Amazon Basics Multi-Angle Desktop Foldable Stand, and it has quickly become an essential accessory for my devices. The build quality appears good—sturdy, scratch resistant and durable, yet lightweight enough to carry around. It works well with both my phone and tablet, holding them securely without any wobble.  One of the standout features is the adjustable angles. It’s incredibly easy to switch between different viewing positions, making it perfect for video calls, streaming, or even just browsing.  The foldable design is a nice touch—it fits easily into my bag when I’m on the go. If I had to nitpick, the stand may feel slightly stiff at first when adjusting angles, but it loosens up with use.",POSITIVE
The product is perfect according to this price.This fits nicely into the wall and can handle to phone weight very nicely.Looking very decent and helpful for daily use.,POSITIVE
It’s very useful and it’s body it’s hard n strong looks like very long lasting and it’s very convenient as it is very small and very much affordable price too,POSITIVE

"I recently purchased this car mobile holder and I'm absolutely loving it! The holder is sturdy, easy to install, and keeps my phone perfectly in view while driving. The adjustable arm allows for seamless customization to fit my phone's size and my preferred viewing angle. The holder's suction cup sticks firmly to the windshield, ensuring zero vibration or movement while driving. The material quality is top-notch, and the sleek design complements my car's interior. This holder has made navigation, hands-free calls, and music playback incredibly convenient. The price is very reasonable, making it an unbeatable value for money. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a reliable and convenient car mobile holder.",POSITIVE

"It is very good and useful, vaccum quality is good but not sticking on dotted dashboard other wise other thing are good and mobile holding capacity is excellent...I have 3-4 mobile holders but this is too good",POSITIVE
"The Product came in a brand packed box. As displayed in picture, the Mobile holder has Carbon-Fiber look and finish on its ABS holder plate. Holder grip is very strong, and Your phone won't jump out on bumpy roads. The Dashboard suction mount is very sticky and strong. Advisable is to install it one time with prior assessment of the installation location; as the more number of times it's un-mounted, it'll take some capability of the suction mount away. I though have felt only slight difference in third time re-installation, but the performance is unaffected. Worth the money, this mount, therefore :)",POSITIVE
Very original & geniune product. Its not just 25 watt fast charger but its actually a superfast charger. I am using it for my Galaxy A54 5G. Super fast charging.,POSITIVE
"At the very outset it looks and works exactly like a Samsung genuine adapter. Build is sturdy and the port is appropriately cut out. It supports super fast charging. No issues about its performance. Definitely it's a value for money product. Design is attractive and light weight comparatively. However, I couldn't verify the genuinity of the product.",POSITIVE
"The charger is excellent and supports 25W fast charging, which is impressive. It charges my 6000mAh phone battery from 0 to 100% in about 1 hour and 30 minutes. The charger doesn’t heat up while in use, is lightweight, and works perfectly with my Samsung smartphone. The quality is good, and I like the simple design. I chose the white color because it matches the cable, but the charger isn’t wrapped in plastic, so it might get dirty or look dull over time.  However, the packaging could be improved, and the price feels a bit high. I also request Samsung to include chargers with budget phones or lower the price to make it more affordable.",POSITIVE
Authentic and we'll performing unit. Supports fast charging. Supports mobile and tablet.,POSITIVE
Super fast charging 😊,POSITIVE
"Excellent quality adapter! Samsung original adapter it has the potential to protect your device as well as manages your device health. I have been using Samsung devices for many years--- of course earlier Samsung provided adapter with device but now have to buy separate adapter it's OK because I believe in quality so Samsung does it----- and I am completely satisfied with this, it feels like a premium adapter. I will definitely recommend this to you guys go for it.",POSITIVE

"I am an earphone addict. I think I am eligible to write this review. I received it on 21 October and today is 29 October and the battery is still at 50%. I know it's crazyyyyyzzyy. I regret why I didn't bought it sooner. Doesn't have heavenly sound like 50k headphones but it's has Nuclear generated Battery. which you will need to charge only 4to5 times a month.  Bike ride It's not ideal for bike riding, it's for indoor use, alot of wind noise when riding, but no wind noise when plugged inside the helmet, additionally it makes alot of noise when you touch the earphone wire, the noise is not from the speaker btw  battery Battery is great, no question about it. It's been 8 day's, I use it everyday and carry it everywhere and still it has 50% battery. after 8 days continuous used.  Sound loudness The sound is loud I Don't recommend anyone to use it more than 80% level unless you want to lose your hearing within a year. 40% sound level satisfy me. It's too loud. If you put it more than 80% it's too dangerous for the eardrum.  lasting I Don't expect to last it more than 1 year, like every boat earphone i have bought previously. ( they can last only 1 year maximum which is kind of disappointing.) it's like boat earphone are built to last exactly 1 years. which makes you buy again and again. Which of course makes sense. if they build a earphone that last forever. they won't be able to sell their newly launched product anymore.  look it looks good when you put it around the neck without listening. but when you put it in your ear it doesn't look cool ( around public) if you want to look cool this is not the right choice for you 😁  Can connect 2 blutooth device at the same time But the problem is, it can't recognise which is yours and which isn't, so when someone near you turn on their bluetooth, it will directly connect to it. which is kind of a minor problem. but i suppose boat apps can fixed it.  sound quality sound quality is kind of in the middle, I Don't have complains, but it's far better than 500 rs wired earphone IMO. the bass has high beat sound. mids and treble are perfect for me, bass is too much for me, IDK About your opinion.  Noise block (ANC)  If you play music to 30-40% sound level, you won't hear anyone talking near you. but if you Don't play any music, the noise level is blocked around 10% i would say. Considering this doesn't have any ANC it's great.  i will update after 1,2,3 months used.",NEGATIVE
"I’ve been using the boAt Rockerz 255 ANC, and honestly, it’s a solid buy. The battery life is unbelievable—100 hours on a full charge! Plus, the quick charge feature is a lifesaver. Got just 10 minutes? You’ll still get 24 hours of playback.  The sound is bass-heavy and clear, perfect for music lovers. ANC works well for drowning out constant background noise, and calls are crystal clear thanks to the 3-mic setup.  On the downside, the sound gets a bit distorted at higher volumes, and the wires feel a little fragile. But for this price, it’s packed with features and definitely worth it!  Verdict: Great value for money, especially if you love long battery life and solid features. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Amazing product, it has a great Battery life and charges in a jiffy. Maybe with heavy usage I need to charge it 3 times in a week. Sound is just amazing and the magnetic ear tips to switch off and on is a very very useful and super feature. Pairing is super fast with just a short sound without any voice message. It's great value for money and compatible with any device with dual pairing. The only negative is that the buttons are small due to the size of the device itself",POSITIVE
"Looks good, it's loud and good but lacking bass. It's just a general earphone without much features. Also the magnetic buds does not disconnect when both the pods are attached so it's always on, it would be better to save battery when not in use but in this case you need to switch it off.",NEGATIVE
"i like the design and quality of the neckband. only i did not like the touch control it would be better if company provide buttons instead of touch control.sometimes they are not working as expected. only for the touch control i am giving 4 star out of 5 ratings.battery life is very good , i have been using this product since last 1 year its durable . sound quality is awesome. its very comfortable to wear and listen songs for long time",POSITIVE
"I dont use it much. maybe 4 hours a week. it is Jan of the next year. I am hoping to get some sort of warranty. will update the replacement/repair status later. Here are good things that i observed since my purchase of this device since April 2024. 1. connects really well, especially with devices with Bluetooth v5.3. 2. sound quality is nothing to complain about.  Now, here are the not so good things: 1. it stopped working at the end of December. there are no visible signed of abuse or stressed cables. The device connects well and all the buttons respond as usual. just that there is no sound coming from them 2. the voice clarity leaves a lot to be desired. it will pick up noise from ceiling fan, where the wind will make the microphone in here useless.  I am not sure what can be expected with this kind of budget. Hope you find this review helpful",NEGATIVE
"I would Rate - 4.1 of 5  Construct and Build - Now this one is a tough nut and if you are one to handel delicate things with insensitive attitude be aware this will put you to challenge as it is VERY VERY DURABLE and the construct is also asthetically appealing, if you want it to look good just avoid the contact with dust and you will savour it in complete sense it is noteable the wire to the probes are of goodquality and can sustain some torture but avoid doing so just to check.  The battery backup is as promissed and charge easily, not very great in terms of duration of play time but the built compensates for this shortcoming and the touch buttons are sturdy  The Sound quality is not very great as one would expect from a decent set but can not blame for this price range the noise in the relay is the issue the connectivity is as expected if the bluetooth devices and the call handeling is also as one would want from the device. Low on fund and can appreciate a bit medium sound quality and love durabilty, dont think just buy it.",POSITIVE
Good,POSITIVE
I specifically bought this to try this product and found that the middle button says adios amigo and nothing more no idea on how to fix it.  It’s a shady product do not buy this product.,NEGATIVE
You don't have to charge them again & again that's why I bought them the quality is really nice looks good in this color sound is very clear light weight durability is good .,POSITIVE

This has never happened to me with any other wired earphones- Miniso or skullcandy, or the Bluetooth ones- JBL or Bose.

Phone is of low quality. Gave a boot error on the 2nd day. You don't get any support from Amazon Customer Service as they will advice you to go to Itel service center. Serviced the phone from the service center and if didn't last 24 hours. Difficult to get a refund and you will be forced to run after Amazon Customer support and Itel Service center. Absolutely useless product and substandard service.,NEGATIVE

"Brand new condition... I am very happy,my durga puja best gift.... Thanx Amazon... 👌👌👌👌",POSITIVE
One of the best mobile you can get in this range! The camera quality is good.. It has small display at back which if you have desk job and you listen to songs or see notification or anything.. It is good and action key is my favourite as I can customize as I want. Charging is fast and battery power is also good. Clean android and amazing display also.. Hoping they keep improving with time! No heating issue! In display fingerprint sensor is also amazing. No issue with connectivity 👍,POSITIVE
"The design and feel of this smartphone is incredible with matt glass back and curved screen. The steel metal rails on edges are shiny and look really premium. Great build quality overall.  Camera island gives a nice symmetrical look, also good grip area. The back screen is very useful for using main camera for photo. It also has Always on display option for back display. Could have been more customisable with cutom images/more animations.  Performace is great, no lags, no heat very efficient 4nm tsmc processor with only 2.5 ghz so no problem with battery life. Charging speed is very good 66 watts. It's my first 5g phone and experience is great. No battery issue with 5g very efficient there as well.  Beautiful Amoled screen is smooth, reponsive and vibrant. Brightness is decent. Great software experience. Action button is super useful! What a great addition.  Dual speaker are crisp and very useful. Sarisfied with camera quality, as I'm not a huge camera person, it's difficult to judge for me. OIS helps. Also, good vibration motor.  For cons -  No micro sd. Have to get 256 GB variant because of that. But, storage provided is good quality and fast ufs3.1  The button place is such that I accidently press the opposite button. Volume is opposite to lock and action button. It took some getting used to for me personally.",POSITIVE
"I have been using the phone for the last 3 months. Battery backup is huge, you would not get such powerful battery in anyother phone, Inscreen fingerprint sensor is mind blowing. Performance is great, never faced any issue, does not hand, no lagging - be advised I do not play high graphic hungry games like CODM or any other battle royales. There is absolutely no heating issue. Touch quality is smooth. One crutial thing that Lava needs to work on is the camera. They have provided the wide angle camera which is great but the issue lies in the primary camera. For apparent no reasons the camera would go out of focus and even after trying for many minutes will not correct itself. Another thing is the zoom, as soon as you go above 2x, the quality will go towards bad and light capturing decreases. Apart from these issues, the phone is great. the mini screen in the back is a nice addition.",POSITIVE

"Frnds I got this phone by exchange Colour:- Glass Viridian after 1 week use I posting this review positive:- First of all for this budget no one gives you 3D curve glass 👌 all of them saying rich look and stylish ,glorrila glass also good, smooth touch and weight is less , I thinked display will be mild smaller due to 6.67 but display is length wise big simply owesome. Back and FrontCamera is decent and clearity also ok and fast charging is good it takes only 1 hour maximum.For normal use camera backup one day is good. Performance also good Cons:- Peek brightness is very low when using in ☀️ light and battery is gets draining medium faster while watching YouTube and movies. When batery comes to below 15 percent it will speed mild charge lowing.  Note:- Use dark mode on for saving battery and charge only upto 85 percent for extent battery life pls don't on battery saver (after on only it will drain very faster)",NEGATIVE
I'm writing this review after using it 3 months. I bought first time LAVA company mobile..  Sabse badi problem hai ki ye phone bahut slow hai or boht zyada hang karta hai. CAMERA front and back is not upto the mark. Front camera to bahut hi bekar hai.. night photography k liye to bilkul useless hai. BATTERY light use karne par bhi jaldi discharge ho jati hai and full charging time is 1hr 45 minute. Sirf look hi theek hai.. baki sab bakwas. LAVA Pathetic company and pathetic mobile.. Don't buy this if you don't want to waste your money. Your piece of mind will also disturb after buying this. Better spend 4 to 5 thousand more and go for iqoo Z9s Thanks,NEGATIVE
"I'm posting this review after more than 3 weeks of usage. This is an excellent product at this price point. I bought this at 15500/- For 256 GB variant in sale with bank discounts.

Sound Quality is very good with stereo speakers. The 5G connectivity is good. The battery life is excellent. It almost run for the whole day with heavy usage. The screen size is very perfect and it feels very light and comfortable in the hand. The design is very premium and it has glass on both front and back. It feels very premium. The camera is ok, nothing much to talk about. Lava has produced such an excellent smartphone at this price point. I have become a fan of Lava for producing such a good product.

"I recently purchased the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro in-Ear Wired Earphones, and I am extremely satisfied with the performance! The 10mm drivers deliver excellent sound clarity with balanced bass, making it a great choice for music lovers. The audio is crisp and clear, whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or attending calls.  The built-in mic is a fantastic addition, ensuring smooth communication during calls.

This product is very good sound is very dynamic and stereo i always recommend to my purchase family then you purchase order directly and also ear fit fine and button quality bad that a only call take so your choice my experience very good so durability tough weight very low,NEGATIVE
"It's been about 3 months, since I am using this earphone and trust me these will meet upto your expectations. Whether it's about sound quality, bass or design and weight of course.  I too have boat's neckband(with prize 8-10 times more than its) and using both for long time. The sound has a little variation in terms of bass and quality of course(what else we can expect in this price 😁₹180) but good for daily use.  The only negative side I will point out is about the quality of the product. The wire quality is not upto the mark (3/5), you have to handle it carefully and the earbuds are made of plastic material. Also the the button in the microphone is not at all useful, sometimes it works only to stop ongoing songs but you can't increase or decrease the volume.  Overall I'll give it 4✨under the price I bought.  An important suggestion:- If you find this product under the range of ₹200.And dont want to go for some high rate earhones, just go for it. It would be a good product to you. Otherwise, you can check out for some other earphones under 500. Some of them are boat or MI earphones and boult audio bass earphones. 👍  Hope this will be helpful for you guys.🙂",NEGATIVE
"This product is above average the packaging of it good size of earpiece good perfectly fitting, functionality is working,wire quality also good,and weight is light sound is above average but good its depends if you like more treble,bass or whatever but for as a beginner its a good choice, But one thing i missed is i received only one ear tips as showed in the video. Overall this is a good product comes in vibrant colours ,you can use for daily.",POSITIVE

"This is another reliable, standard smartphone charger for most Android phones, at an affordable price. Charging my old Redmi 9 effectively since the week of its arrival. Didn't expect it to be super-fast, but not a snail, either!  Getting the dual Port at this price is an obvious plus point. But Portronics is offering only one micro USB cable in this deal. Getting the second, C type cable would make this a real steal-deal, which most customers won't be able to resist.  That's why I didn't give more than 3 stars.",NEGATIVE

Good charging speed provide. It's cable Al's good but loose.,NEGATIVE
"I would like to start by saying I'm not an audiophile, therefore my review will be less about the audio quality of the product and more about the over all experience regarding the product. First off, this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it, it's good enough that I will buy it a third time if need be! Upon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of 3 pair of extra ear buds . There is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds, these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement. More on this later. Coming to the ear phones itself, it's among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand. It is very durable, specially the plug part that connects to your phone, many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones. This is not the case with these. The wire itself is made of rubber/silicon. It feels good in hand and the only thing I can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasn't showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires. Another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out, this genuinely decreases the number of instances where I find myself trying to untangle the wire. This is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphones. Remember I said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal? Well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter. Both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin. I don't know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face. It is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume, personally this problem didn't affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breaker. Mic quality is subject to individual bias therefore I can tell you my personal experience. In my opinion I feel that the quality is average, it won't blow anyone's mind but it will deliver most of the time. A common complaint I heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic, these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boAt BassHeads 152 Finally the most important part of the review, the sound quality of the ear phones. As I said earlier I won't be going into the technical details . I am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place. In my opinion I found that the Bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the Extra bass versions of the Sony line up of earphones trend to be. The volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not I use it at less than half it's total volume when listening to music. The clarity of the boAt BassHeads 152 are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the 2000 INR price category this is one other reason why I love this pair so much. A point to remember, as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones. This becomes a double edged sword, on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic. This causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used. The find unlike the ones find in let's say the newer Bose ear phones aren't as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged time. Last but not the least, there are multiple color variants of the boAt BassHeads 152 including red, black and blue. I found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but I find it to be the best of the three. That said I do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color. This leaves out the red, for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales, therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last. Pros: 1) No metal build 2) Excellent wire quality and trendy 3) Durable 4) Above average sound quality Cons: 1) Metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily 2) Supplied Fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time 3) Supplied Clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easily  I hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the BassHeads 220. All suggestions are welcome. Thanking you, Dwarakesh",POSITIVE

"I ordered it in June 2021. Today is May 19, 2024. It's still working. Let's review it under various aspects.  Mic quality: I have two earphones, this one and the famous realme buds 2. Realme buds 2 comes towards more of sound clarity (trable) and thin voice, so sometimes when you listen full bass songs you'll be disappointed with its base. Where as, boat bassheads 152, is the earphone which gives the perfect balance of voice clarity like realme and signature bass of boat. Believe me I have used this earphone for more than 2.5 years. And it's still giving the same experience.  Portability: 4.8 out of 5. You can keep it in pocket, purse, bag etc without worrying about its wire.  Fit: 5 out of 5. It has the perfect angle to fit in your ears.  Durability: Here I can write an essay, but in short just buy it. June 2021 to may 2024, i am still counting and update when it stops working from any side. Ofc you'll see the tape I have used to protect its wire, which was necessary after use of 1.5 years as it's wire is not fully braded, so you need to take care of upper portion near the eartips. It's 6 months and 10 days using realme buds 2, it's one side has stopped working, I am disappointed because it has fully braded wires, still it fails to impress in terms durability.  Comfort and ease of use: 5 out of 5, extremely light weight and easy to fit in your ears, if you are using heavy earphones then you'll love how light it is for your ears. Your ear will thank you for buying it.  No product is perfect Cons 1. You have to take care of upper portion of the wire which is not braded. 2. It doesn't easily tangle, but after use of 1 year you'll get trouble in un-tangle it. 3. If you compare it with premium earphones then yes its mic quality is not as good as those, but in the range 500-700 this gives one of the best mic quality. 4. Unfortunately, poor noise cancellation. I don't mind it btw.  I can't even think about the others cons because I am fond of this earphone.",NEGATIVE
Product is good but it's functionality is not good,NEGATIVE
"I'm impressed with the Boat Bassheads 152 wired earphones its suitable for calling and audio experiences with ANC. However they could have volume control buttons. This is the third piece I ordered and they are quite durable as well as comfortable. Performance wise and size fitting is also good for my ears. However, the maroon mirage color looked like metallic pink in the image and its rather quite different. I would have loved a white color or even metallic pink would've worked fine!",POSITIVE
"The earphone has metal case. Good built quality, sound, looks and feels awesome. The wire has a fabric cover. It's totally worth buying👍👍",POSITIVE
I like this product becoz if is very comfort and easy to fit. No additional help needed. And. Very useful that it can be easily used to touch screen no difficulty. I am able to use the product in rain that it's quality is very appreciated. I can adjust the size according to my capabilities,POSITIVE

I needed a holder to track maps when roaming outside so i bought it and it does it's job well. Good quality and all features intact as mentioned by the seller. Grip is solid and u don't have to worry about your phone falling down. Go for it blindly!!,POSITIVE
i purchased in rainy season last year and total waste of money. was not able to use even for a week.,NEGATIVE
Not at all water resistant but I'll suggest to use this only for Google navigation in non rainy days.,NEGATIVE
Good Product with finishing.,POSITIVE
It fits fine on scooty & helps while navigating google maps.,POSITIVE
The sound quality of this product is very good for this price. Wire lenghth is sufficient. Good plastic material in this price range. But the wire is very soft.Build quality could be a little better.,POSITIVE
"JBL C100 in ear earphone.  ₹549 it's a value for money. Good experience in sound quality. The wire is very thin so very careful while using this earphone and use one pouch easy carrying. No connectivity issues I already checked Mobile, lap and tap.  JBL C100 - Made in china product, currently not facing any issues. I uploaded images of this product for better clarity.",NEGATIVE
"I got these JBL earphones on sale for just 599 !!! Superb sound, comfortable in ear fit and very well made !! Totally worth it at even more than the price I paid !!!!",POSITIVE
"Product is good but only for music that all, if you are into movies games with high sound this product doesn't reach that level, sound and problem quality is good but there is no high volume, very poor volume.",NEGATIVE
really good quality of music. comfortable design. Good for this price range,POSITIVE

These are the cons i Felt.  1- Quality of Sound is not above Average. In this price range We can get Higher Quality of Sound from Panasonic she, Skull candy. I was Expecting alot from JBL.  2- i am not happy with the noise cancellation for a Earphone of price 1399 (without offer). I expect alot as i am a Music Lover.  3- Mic is not that Clear , Low voices are Difficult to transmit. Not at all happy with this.  4- If You are really a Music Lover or you like Quality of Music always , i will not Recommend you. There are other options in this Price range.  ======================= How To check Fake Product : =======================  Step 1- In front of the Box , Under C100SI you will see its Written ""In EAR HEADPHONES"". It Must be Written in white Colour. If its Written in Red or anyOther ,its a duplicate.  Step 2- Turn the Box to back side , Your price will be written in a separate Paper. (Small) like a Sticker. Duplicate will have a Big Sticker.  Step 3- Open the Box , In orginal You will get Warranty card but Not in duplicate.  Step -4 : The size of Mic should be Small, not a wide in comparison with Duplicate.  Step -5 : JBL logo should be Bold and written with Premium .  Step 6- Go to YouTube , Check bass Checking Videos ,if your Earphones are sustainable ,then your is orginal.  ================================= How to Enhance / Get Better Efficiency : =================================  If you have already Purchased it and thinking how to Increase the bass and Quality, i will recommend Go to Play store, there are plenty of Music apps where to customize basses and all needs. I will suggest Go for POWERAMP music player. I personally In Love with that app.  ============= CONCLUSION : =============  This product which is 1399 (without Discount) is really Not Worthy for Value of Money. But if this Product is Under 699 (offer) than its a Good Deal if you want a Mic . So for me VALUE FOR MONEY 💰-= 3.5 *  ============ MY OPINION : ============  IF You want a Earphone which have A premium Looks with mic Under This price Range then Go for it.  If you want an Earphone Under 500 , Go for Philips Extra Bass . For Mic Mi In ear.  If you want an Earphone under 600-650, Go for Panasonic she , for MiC Sony MDR 150 Ap.  If You want an Earphone under 700-800, Go For Cx 180, for Mic Go for this product.  If You want an Earphone under 1000k Go for One piston.  If you want an Earphone under 1200k Go for SONY MDR XB 55.  IF YOU want an Earphone under 2K with mic Go for SONY MDR XB 55AP.  I have Used all the products and Recommending you.

"The sound quality is superb and it is crisp. I've been using it for years and it still works. Amazing product, go for it. I've never thought of buying any other earphones after buying this.",POSITIVE
"BUT...>>>>> Let’s know about its DURABILITY according to me when using this daily with care. So according to me this product is not durable at all in terms of its poor quality rubber material based CABLE which usually always tends to get tangled and wears out really fast when kept in a bag or a pouch and hence as time goes by it leads to affecting its performance in many ways in the long run and so my review is based on one of the major issues that i faced and so this is how it started.......... So first of all AMAZON is not at all blamed for the fault of this product as they packaged it well and delivered it on time before the expected delivery date and i am completely satisfied with AMAZON & it’s SERVICES!!!!! And so it’s the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!  Anyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!! So I will put an update as soon as I’m done solving my issue!!!!!  FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/- THEN!!!!! AND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT’S A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!! BUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :)  AND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.  SO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.in AS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!  Thanks to all of you who read and understand my review. And finally please do comment if you want to do so and if you find this review helpful please hit or click that “Helpful”.",NEGATIVE

Good camera and battery backup,POSITIVE
"The sound quality is good , I can't say best because I have been using wireless neckband and tws since long time. I had bought this just because I had faced charging issues with my pods and was not able to repair them so I needed a backup and was not into putting more more so decided to buy wired earphones . It is working good even after month. Quality is good but I feel that they should change the plug in structure it feels weird conical. Like how other wired ones have strong and much good looking structure. It feels like they compromised here. And also where the mic and button is.. it too feels weak like I had bought 2 of this earphone one for me and my uncle . The one with my uncle is been damaged recently. One of the earphone wire had came out so it now has only one earphone to wear. But mine one is still in good conditon..",NEGATIVE
"body: though earphones can be bought for ₹100 as well but the quality of these BOAT ones is incredibly unmatchable.. it has been almost a week since I'm using them and I'm totally satisfied with the bass, value for money & comfort they provide. moreover the packaging is woah! loving the fact that they come with 2 extra pairs of buds just a little suggestion— the mic should have been more distant from the plugs, the rest of the features are just wow.",POSITIVE
"boad always delivers the best. Good choice for listening to music. With so many features, it lacks dolby atmos support, great product at this low price. thanks for Amazon 😊",NEGATIVE
"In a word, it's good Earphone. but is not a very very good Earphone, it's value for money. My rating is 7.5 out of 10. Bass is medium, it's not very high and it's not very low Bass. You can enjoy music with moderate bass. Personaly I recommend who are bass lover, they should not buy it. Sound quality is good, clear, but it's not very very good and clear, but it's clear. it is litewaite and comfortable in Ear for long time. So, if you are Bass lover, you don't go. but if you need mideum bass, clear sound, yes you must buy it, and enjoy music with bass. One think, i can not get any serial number, from package and warranty card both sides. So i can't Warranty registration. And i wanted contacted to BoAt customer service or etc.",POSITIVE
"Headset quality is perfect and color also same aani ordered functionality, sound quality, volume control, length all good. Nice product to use.. And budget friendly also..",POSITIVE
"These earphones offer fantastic value for money, making them a great choice for music lovers on a budget.  Pros: 1. Impressive Sound Quality: The bass performance is exceptional, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience. Whether I’m listening to music or watching videos, the sound quality is clear and powerful. 2. Stylish Design: The Furious Red color gives these earphones a bold and attractive look. They stand out, and I appreciate the sleek design that complements my style. 3. Comfortable Fit: The in-ear design comes with multiple ear tips, allowing me to find the perfect fit. They stay securely in place, even during workouts or long listening sessions. 4. Built-in Microphone: The mic works well for phone calls and voice commands. The sound quality during calls is clear, making conversations easy and hassle-free. 5. Tangle-Free Cable: The cable is made from a durable material that resists tangling, which is a huge plus for me. It makes storage and transport much more convenient. 6. Affordable Price: Given their performance and quality, these earphones are very reasonably priced. They offer great value compared to many other brands in the market.  Cons: 1. Limited Noise Isolation: While the earphones provide decent passive noise isolation, they may not completely block out external sounds in noisy environments. Users seeking a more immersive experience might want to consider noise-canceling options. 2. Cable Durability: Although the cable is tangle-free, it might be prone to wear and tear with heavy usage. Care should be taken to avoid pulling or bending it excessively. 3. Sound Signature: The bass-heavy sound signature may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those who prefer a more balanced sound profile. It might overpower mids and highs in certain music genres. 4. No Inline Controls: While the microphone is handy for calls, there are no inline controls for volume or playback, which can be inconvenient for some users.  Overall: The boAt Bassheads 100 in Ear Wired Earphones (Furious Red) are an excellent choice for anyone seeking quality sound and comfort at an affordable price. With impressive bass, a stylish design, and a comfortable fit, they’re perfect for daily use. Despite minor drawbacks like limited noise isolation and sound signature, I highly recommend them for anyone looking for budget-friendly earphones that deliver great performance!",POSITIVE
"This earphone got inadvertently tested when I forgot to take it out of a trouser pocket before putting the trouser into a washing machine. By the time, I realised my mistake and retrieved the earphone, it had got soaked in soapy water. To my surprised, after it dried out, the earphone worked well but the microphone performance was badly affected. So I purchased a new set of earphones, boAt of course.",NEGATIVE
"Very good product, worth the money I feel. Only drawback is left right wire length is less, couldn't expand + No noise cancellation.. these two are only let downs, otherwise it's a good product.",POSITIVE
"the sound quality is a bit muddy, especially at lower volumes, but for a dozen dollars, you cant really beat it. really durable too, lasted four months and could've lasted a few more if it weren't for the cruel, steely hatred of wires my pets have",POSITIVE
"Bought these earphones more than 6 months ago, and they're a game-changer! The sound quality is amazing, and they're so comfortable. Love the sleek design and how they stay in place during workouts. A must-have for music lovers!",POSITIVE
I overall loved the hands-free but I think the price is a little higher than it should be. Overall the product is good to purchase.,POSITIVE
"Good value for the money , Good quality",POSITIVE
The product quality is worse the right ear phone was damaged with in a month,NEGATIVE
"Easy to install, seem to be sturdy Vibration damping need to be proven after few kilometers Good product",NEGATIVE
"Good quality, light weight, easy to use, grip is good. As compared with other holders this is the best for city or long drives.",POSITIVE
"I am usi6it for a whole week, it is showing good quality. And it does not have that much vibration issue. It is really the best product. In this price range it is really outstanding.",POSITIVE
The product is having very good quality.,POSITIVE
"Good Product but 500 is bit costly with regards to the technicality. It is basically spring system so you press by the side and it wide opens to put in your phone and then you release and it locks. And when you press the phone from the top the spring suddenly release. So I feel it will loosen up very soon and not recommended for frequest users, they can opt for the manual one that locks by screw.",NEGATIVE
The Phone holder fits very well on my Honda Bike. You can adjust ( add or remove) the rubber inside the groove to fit your bikes handle. The Fitting is easy and once you tighten the phone grip is good. I did a small ride on the bike along with the phone to show navigating and it worked perfectly fine. No complaints it's value for money. The installation is easy and the build quality is good.,POSITIVE

"This is an updated review : So just moved from S20, which I had for so many years to the new S24. The phone itself is good, everything works fine.. but that's expected. Got the Golden yellow colour and thankfully it's not as flashy as shown in the photos.. this is more of a light cream colour which gives a slight golden shine when seen at particular angles. It's a very decent looking phone.  When you use it, the first thing you notice is that this phone really heats up. It's Samsungs flagship and the heating issue is not limited to just while charging it, even when you use it normally.. the back gets hot. Never faced this with the S20. I feel like am using some cheap Chinese phone...well it won't burn your ear, but yes it's hot enough for one to take note. >>And now after a few more days of usage, the heating issue has disappeared. Even after hours of continuous use it doesn't heat up... not sure what happened.. perhaps some software update.  Second is the design. Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking! >> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.  The battery drains out fast aswell.. currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around. >> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.  Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range. >> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.  Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there. I think I might switch back to the S20. >> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though. The AI functions are also quiet handy. Just played around till now.. so hopefully like the other aspects will get better with time.🤞",NEGATIVE
"I have been using this phone for a month now and the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a very good phone. If you are someone who is looking to buy a phone in this price range then you probably have the Iphone 15, Pixel 8 series as an alternative option but I would say the Samsung phone experience is the best of the three unless you are into the Apple ecosystem or you want to buy and IPhone cuz it's an IPhone (It's just crazy that many people make decisions like that 😂).  Jokes apart, I would say at this price this is probably the best phone in terms of the display, software experience and overall features. The performance is also very good, there are many people who are skeptical about the Exynos chips which is obviously unfair from Samsung to have two versions of the same phone but at least this time the chip is very good and almost as powerful as the SD 8 Gen 3. Yes it is 10-15% less powerful in the CPU department from benchmarks but honestly theses flagship chipsets are so powerful that 90% of the people are not even going to notice the slight difference. I tried playing COD on this phone at max possible settings for 1 hour and the phone was hot but not any more hot than any other phone would get. Yes it did drop the battery which I will get to later but I don't think raw performance is an issue with the Exynos chips this time as the Exynos chips is actually more powerful that the SD 8 Gen 3 in the GPU department. Now coming to the battery this is the only place I am a little disappointed with this phone like if you are a light user who only uses their phone for calls, messages, music on bluetooth you can make the phone work for an entire day but if you are a medium or a heavy user like if you play games, take pictures, videos etc you will definetly drain the battery before the end of the day. In my experience I am a fairly heavy user using bluetooth, mobile hotspot, playing a few light games I always need to charge the phone at around 5 pm. But this is a sacrifice you have to make if you are getting a small phone, now if you are thinking that the IPhone 15 is also a small phone but it has better battery life then that is because the IPhone 15 only has a 60hz display which isen't as smooth the 120hz on all the phones these days and also does not consume a lot of battery like a 120hz display would. I am not that big of a camera bluff so I won't talk about it just want to say that it is a good camera with sharp pictures with good looking colors and camera features (Checkout the images attached). The video is also very good.  Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 emerges as an impressive smartphone, overshadowing debates about Exynos chip performance differences. Its overall performance, combined with its compact size, makes it a compelling choice for users seeking a premium smartphone experience.",NEGATIVE
Everything works good 👍,POSITIVE
Really good to use,POSITIVE
"This is an original phone. But it's the china variant. You will see quite a lot of notifications in chinese randomly. Plus, the biggest let-down is that it does not have eSim option. I kept wondering what the catch was for such low price, and found it during my travel.",NEGATIVE
It is best cable at this price point. I bought it at 75rs. Quality of the cable is much good than other cable which make it more durable. Overall it the best cable you should use for daily life for long term . The cable length is good so that you would struggle much if you're on using phone while charging. It is compatible with all the adaptors,POSITIVE
"Product Quality:  1. Build quality: This has a braided design which adds to the durability and resistance to wear and tear. It feels sturdy and well made compared to standard plastic cables in the market 2. Connector quality: The type C connector fit snugly into device without wobbling, ensure a stable connection. The joints near the connectors are reinforced properly, reducing the chances of fraying. 3. Length: Length is appropriate which is of 1 metre and is highly portable and convinient.  Functionality: 1. It supports fast charging and delivers consistent performance 2. Data transfer speed is also high and ensures efficient syncing between devices 3. Compatible with almost all the modern devices as its a type C usb.  Overall Experience The durability is good, the cable is sturdy in nature , its fast charging is an addaded advantage at this cost while i sometime belive it speed get decrease randomly while transferring the data, Cable length could be more , sometimes it feels very restrictive",POSITIVE
"product is good and quality is great according to price , My phone was charging fast with this cable",POSITIVE
"Good Quality but a bit short, Charge phone Rapidly",NEGATIVE
"Works as expected ; braided cable is a plus ; truly VFM. Using since one week, so far so good. Supports 'Fast Charging' (PS: mine is a fast charger but not VooC).",POSITIVE
Very good item. Fast charging cable. Nice and good looking. Smooth and strong,POSITIVE
Good quality,POSITIVE
For charging ok. But for data connection to pc it's not working after one day. Disappointed,NEGATIVE
"This is post 3 days of using of phone and simply couldn't resist myself from writing this review. Got the Razor Green 12 GB 512 GB for 32K post Bank discount. Adding some context before diving into my experience. I was an S22 Ultra user and ditched the same for OnePlus 12 SD8G3. I wanted an add on phone for office use and for gaming (BGMI & MKX). Got this one post going through round of comparisons against IQOOs out there. Not I just had one sim in the phone as I was using it. So coming straight to how I rate this phone. It is a 5/5 for me. Looks: 4/5 ✌️✌️✌️✌️ Display: 5/5 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Touch Response: 5/5 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈 Performance: 5/5 ✨✨✨✨✨ Gaming performance: 5/5 👍👍👍👍👍 Speaker Output: 5/5 ( very decent) Battery: 10/5 ( Simply marvellous) Charging speed: 15/5 (no comments) Camera: 4/5 (boosted this up from 3 to 4 based off overall happiness with the phone and considering the price factor) OS: 4/5 (-1 because of few preloaded apps) Finger print scanner: 5/5  So what I loved: Display and performance crisp and buttery smooth. OS is clean too to the most. SD7+G3 takes on any tasks thrown on it with ease. No hassles in multitasking. Got July security patch as of yesterday so all good on that front too. Now speaking about what I'm in love with - Being an S22 Ultra user I must say the biggest pain point has been battery since day 1. Max gaming time 3.5 Hrs. in the initial days which reduced to 1.5 over a span of 2 years. Stand-by was crazy bad too on S22 Ultra. This Lil gizmo GT 6T is a dream in this case. 3 days of game play BGMI 5 Hrs. each day and was left with 22% of juice still remaining each time. And post sleep of 6 hrs. the phone still retained 17% of charge. This already is insane in my perspective. Now coming to the charging aspect, this is unimaginable. Lightning fast... 17% - 100% in 22 minutes. Speechless in this front. Sammy used to take like 1 hr and 10 mins. in the initial days and post an year and half I really don't know. Gaming done without gtmode. Frame rate was set to auto adaptive. BGMI played in Smooth Extreme+. Brightness at ~45%. No throttling or heating. It got slightly warm at a point (really no where close to be called as heating) and then cooled too which is 😍😍😍. WhatsApp, FB, Insta, Gmail, O365, Teams and all other apps on the background. So you can go for this one blindfolded if you are looking for a phone with great backup and performance (gaming performance). I hope this is helpful. What I didn't like: Given all of above a 3.5 mm slot was expected. And sound output in headphones could have been better. I used Sony WH1000XM3 for gaming and Wf1000XM4 for listening to music and watching movie to test the output. Again you can hear all the footsteps and minute details and same applies to music if not all details but covers 90% of it but somewhere lacks the loudness factor by a bit and no Dolby Atmos so less to mention there. Lastly, I didn't cover anything on cam perspective because I was really not looking at this phone from that aspect and me sharing my experience on that front will definitely make no sense as the comparison will be against S22 Ultra here and this reaches no where close to it which is completely fine given it is not even 1/4th of the price for which I had bought S22 Ultra. That said both front and rear cam are decent is all I can say from price point perspective. Overall this is a bang on deal from my perspective and would definitely recommend going for it if you are not cam centric and looking for a great performer!",NEGATIVE
"Great curved screen and elegant design, amazing performance! Good for BGMI game to play @90fps(tested) without any lag by enabling GT mode🤩🥳  Cameras are big and entire back looks very premium but, the brand provided case is of no use because of its big space to showcase the cameras entire area😤 it looks awkward with that case on🤮 I recommend The GiftKart liquid silicon back case(black) which costed me 299/- its a good case that provides utmost security and also proper grip, it gives a premium look and feel for the mobile by covering all the unnecessary gaps..  I am glad that I have availed the discount coupon of 7k that was available for some period on amazon and bought the mobile for ₹23,998/- and I am super happy🥳😍 Great sound and screen, the cameras also amazing and captures best shots📸🏞️  I have used all brands from Nokia to Apple. My majority mobiles was of Nokia, LG, Samsung, Motorola and Apple 5S.. Then One+ 3t, iPhone Xr and now from last 2 years with iPhone 12.  I have bought Mi max, Vivo, Poco X3, Realme GT Neo 3 and Motorola g54 mobiles for my wife so far to play PUBG/BGMI often with my kids as well and now bought this Realme GT 6t🥳😁..  I have used lots of mobile phones and now I can say this is the best, one can get under 31k price tag! If you get it lower than that, you’re damn lucky🥳😍😎🕺🏻…  Note: The design, looks and colours are depends on individual tastes but, the mobile phone is definitely a power packed all rounder🔥🔥🔥",POSITIVE
Good and handy phone Good Camera. Great Display and sound quality Smooth and powerful performance. 7-8 hours Screen on time with normal use.,POSITIVE
"I was searching for smartphone for a long time because my old smartphone (2019 bought) becoming aged and getting slowed down, on my research i was impression that either i would go with a lower mid range smartphone or a premium (preferable samsung) smartphone.  So i was not sure that what i have to purchase but my preferences was (in descending order) Battery 🔋+ charging speed Performance (upgrade from SD855) Storage Screen brightness (out visibility must be good) 5G bands atleast 10 (most usable) UI (software, atleast acceptable)  Overall if these check boxes are ticked ✅ (rest things comes complimentary).  So this query bring me the following smartphones at similar prices. 1. POCO F6 12/512 2. Realme GT 6T 8/256 3. OnePlus Nord 4 8/128  However Poco is powerful among these with FLAT SCREEN but we all know why many avoid poco, so left with two options Realme or OnePlus then again OnePlus green line mass problem forced me to think twice and decided to go with Realme GT 6T with curved screen (with the thought that if i disliked it even slightly, I'll sell it within days).  So Waited for BBD/Geart indian festival SALES Keeping all phones on list because if prices get's uneven (due to massive discount) then preferences will again change.  The day arrived got hige discount on POCO but till then i had made my mind to go with Realme (overall good software with everything balanced and compromising on Screen because it's a curved screen).  Ordered this RELAME GT 6T 8/256GB variant (Green looks sober, classy and not too shiny)  Then new fear unlock seeing Delivery frauds (some accuses seller, some accuses delivery partner and so on) researched about this. And was waiting for delivery with All the guns (safety measures) loaded.  Parcel arrived Talked with delivery guy, told him the seller/delivery frauds, he was a really nice guy, listened carefully and helped me to check ✅ parcel thoroughly after inspection we concluded that parcel (high security packaging) is TEMPERED, is strongly recommended me to cancel because it is high-value package so don't take risk  We proceeded with cancellation provided OTP for cancellation, order cancelled successfully. Within seconds he realises that package we looking was different and we cancelled my package, i was like (abbey, Harmonium) oh brother. Then i asked to check my parcel packaging and to my surprise that too was tempered (high security packaging considered tempered with when white line don't appear clearly or turns color PINK/GREEN with clearly visible side numbers) so i was relaxed that it's okay  But i had second thought and asked him to see if he can still deliver my package, he was looking to try to deliver package even after cancellation, he tried to send otp for delivery but no luck because OTP not received (tried multiple times),  I lost the hope and about ti leave the spot then he told me to wait, he called to warehouse operator asked him if he can mark this cancelled package as delivered, he said YES, within seconds he marked order delivered and package handover to me. Then i realised OTP thing also caused due to network, so Turned on flight ✈️ mode on then off, just afte that recieved 5 OTP messages. Told him this, he said no problem backend delievery system don't need OTP,  I Left the spot, thinking that i have made a big (costly) mistake, because Amazon don't offer open box delivery and often deny Returns (service centre replacement policy).  Reached into room, placed package on table, turned on Camera, inspected everything on camera. I was too nervous to open the box.  Just started to open and when i seen phone box with security seal and plastic sheet over the box (some relief).  Carefully open phone box and took BEAST into my Hand 👌🏽👌🏽, That look was amazing 🤩 Everything sorted.  💥🌟💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨✨💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨ DEVICE-REVIEW-HERE DEVICE-REVIEW-HERE  Review part: • Battery [9hrs with 5G always on with auto Refresh Rate and with mixed Wi-Fi+5G usage 12+hrs]🔋+charging (I'm not going back to slow charging again ever) • Performance is really beast (more than expected) • Screen brightness 🔅 SUPER AMAZING • UI (after removing and disabling bloats) amazing • Speaker and camera also good (but low light camera performance is not good)  Overall I'm with this beast for next few years (maybe 5yrs) if everything went as usual.  Build quality is plastic and finger prints are visible if Cover or skin not applied.  However i still feel if this had FLAT screen it would be blind suggestion for everyone (normal/casual user).  Call quality is excellent, Google dialer comes default but can be changed to Odialer for call recording.  I felt if someone who use multiple apps (more than 10 except calls/sms/email/Play Store) for daily usage, needs to tweak battery settings for every single app to achieve optimal battery backup else would face battery drain issues (faced this but that was once in a month kind thing).  Overall no battery drain or charging issues, no issues with calls (I'm using jio). Day light video/photography is better.  Overall a BEAST I bought 8/256 @ 26k (with card discount). Please vote up 👍🏽 if you find it helpful.  Thanks",NEGATIVE

"1. “Absolutely Terrible Product and Service!” I purchased the DJI gimbal, and it stopped working after just a few uses. When I tried to get it fixed, I realized there isn’t a single service center that could help. I’ve contacted support multiple times, but the issue remains unresolved. This is the worst investment I’ve ever made. Save your money and go for a brand with better customer service. 2. “Waste of Money - No Support Available!” The DJI gimbal I bought turned out to be a complete waste. It malfunctioned almost immediately, and to my shock, there are no service centers available to fix it. I’ve been left with an expensive paperweight. I’m beyond frustrated with this purchase. DJI seriously needs to improve their customer support and service network. 3. “Do Not Buy - Faulty Product and No Help!” I regret buying the DJI gimbal. It stopped working within weeks, and there’s no service center to fix the problem. I’ve tried everything, but I’m left with a defective product and no solution. This has been my worst investment to date. Avoid this product at all costs! 4. “DJI Gimbal - The Worst Investment I’ve Made!”",NEGATIVE
I tried to search dji mimo in play store but I couldn't find and I tried to search in dji website and downloaded apk and tried to install in my realme mobile and it was awesome but when I tried to install in my s23 ultra I suggested me to turn of auto blocker in security and privacy setting Then I surf to Google that why it was removed from playstore then I known that due to security and privacy it was removed so that's why I'm returning the product  Other wise it was good,NEGATIVE
Works really great. DJI products are amazing as always. Very handy and easy to use provides awesome stability,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 Gimbal Stabilizer for my iPhone 15 Pro Max, which is encased in a bulky OtterBox Defender XT case. I must say, this product has exceeded my expectations in every way.  First and foremost, the compatibility with my phone and case is flawless. I was initially concerned that the size and weight of my phone, combined with the case, might pose a challenge for the gimbal. However, the Osmo Mobile 6 handled it with ease. My phone securely fits in the clamp, and the gimbal maintains stable and smooth footage, even during fast movements.  The 3-axis stabilization technology is outstanding, providing incredibly steady shots that look professional and cinematic. Whether I'm shooting vlogs, capturing family moments, or creating content for YouTube and TikTok, this gimbal ensures my videos are always rock-steady.  The built-in extension rod is a fantastic addition, making it even easier to get those hard-to-reach angles and creative shots. It adds versatility to my content creation without the need for additional equipment.  Object tracking is a handy feature that works accurately and consistently, keeping your subject in focus as you move the gimbal around. This has improved my video production quality significantly.  The foldable and portable design of the Osmo Mobile 6 is a real plus. It's easy to carry in a bag or even your pocket, making it perfect for on-the-go shooting.  The sleek slate gray color gives it a modern and premium look.  In summary, if you're using an iPhone 15 Pro Max with an OtterBox Defender XT case and are looking for a high-quality gimbal stabilizer, the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 is an excellent choice. It's reliable, versatile, and delivers outstanding results. I'm extremely satisfied with this product and highly recommend it to fellow content creators and smartphone videographers.",POSITIVE

"Pros Display is 2K clear,punchy and brighter. Battery SOT is Awesome. Speakers are very loud. Haptics are good. Charging spped is good but i recommend using 10/18W charger to charge it at night so u will maintain good battery health for very longtime. Cpu is extremely optimized it doesn't throttle but whereas GPU throttles in Gpu benchmarks which doesnt occur at gaming so u dont need to worry about that. Camera is OK Ok not perfect but no bad too. No panel gaps.  Cons: Software i say its not much of premium and i recommend many of them to not to update it and keep it stock software.",POSITIVE

"Switching to the iQOO 13 feels like leveling up in every way! This phone is an absolute powerhouse—whether it’s gaming, multitasking, or just casual scrolling, it handles everything like a pro. 💪 The Snapdragon chip inside makes it lightning fast ⚡, and the AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate is buttery smooth. Watching videos or gaming feels like a dream. 🎮🎥  The camera is a major highlight 📸—it captures stunning photos even in low light, and the video stabilization is top-notch. Plus, the battery life is impressive 🔋, and with superfast charging, I’m back at 100% in no time!  And yes, I was a little skeptical about using a Chinese phone, but Funtouch OS has surprised me. It’s clean, smooth, and pretty user-friendly. I also took extra precautions with my personal data, and so far, no issues! 👌  If you’re looking for a phone that’s a perfect mix of performance, style, and value, the iQOO 13 is a no-brainer. Highly recommended! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",POSITIVE
"I have 16gb/516 . Few things what I experienced 1 In this price it is way better and beautiful phone. 2 BGMI works in 120Hz by default and can go upto 144 hz and it feels so defferent and u have better upper hand in this game. 3 camera is also very good.works in all day night. 4 battery is 6000Mah and charger is 120 watt it takes 30 minutes to charge from 0-100 and and last for a day or more depending upon ur usage. 5 Screen is very bright in pure day light too under extreme sunlight and can use extra dimming for pure dark . 6 Sound is very punchy and loud , 7 Dynamic light on the camera rings feels premium. 8 Snapdragon 8 elite is way faster than others no heating issue .  There is 1 major drawback which I felt Although the ultra Sonic finger print works way faster than optical finger print and it works well with even wet hand BUT.......it does not work when u apply any screen guard it never recognise ur finger no matters which screen guard u apply it only works with thin paper screen guard only at present there is no settings to overcome this flaw.  Rest phone is very fast beautiful,handy and looks premium with all the latest features.",POSITIVE
Pros Phone Display - Awesome with extremely high resolution screen  Camera - Main Camera is pretty good with crystal clear pics and multiple options for Zoom  Battery - Last Solid 1-1.5 days with Net and light Gaming usage. Charger is extremely fast and phone gets fully charged in 30 mins  Processor - Pretty fast with Gaming Engine adjusting itself depending on type of game being played...Memory availability is high  Speakers - Pretty Good & Clear Sound Volumes in speaker mode  Cons  Selfie Camera - Selfie Camera could have been better... pics are not clear if the external surroundings lighting is not optimal.  However if the external lights are good then Selfie Pics are clear in terms of resolution and clarity  Touch - Lags sometimes while moving from one window to other...could have been better... However it is not let down otherwise  Overall a Solid Performance Phone with Livid High Resolution Camera,POSITIVE

Excellent power services. Power consumption is very less. Battery charging very quick. Performance is very good in comparison to device's price. Taking into account of sounds brightness display quality etc overall performance is commendable. A good product.,POSITIVE
"I don’t have words to explain the quality of camera, only can say it is pathetic, poor, disgusting etc. I have connected with their team also and they told me that they can’t do any thing as camera will provide this type of pic only. I will suggest please don’t buy Redmi Note 14 mobile it is totally wastage of money and they are fooling by saying it is 50mp camera; however my old mobile provide better pic. I am going to request to Amazon also please don’t keep these type of low standard product which are costing so much. I am never going to buy electronic product from Amazon because if quality of product is not good u can’t return it and ur hard earned money will go to waste and will suggest my family and friends also not to buy electronic product from Amazon.",NEGATIVE

"Display,Audio, Camera, Prosessar,3mejer Software Updates,, Memory Card Slot These Are Enaff For Best All-rounder Totally Killar in 20k-30k in Price Segment 👍👌",POSITIVE
Surprisingly good product for the price. I have generally purchased the flagship phones of OnePlus with the assumption that they are better than the Nord-series. I now stand corrected. The NORD CE range is definitely an economical range and not meant for heavy usage but the Nord series are more than capable of taking on heavy usage. The camera is not great but at the price point it is more than adequate. The phone is well built and looks good. The finger print reader is quick and efficient. Phone functionality being almost bare bones androrid is high on user friendliness. A definite buy!,POSITIVE
"Bought the phone a month ago. Safe to say at this price range, for me, it's banger. A fast and smooth software experience and tough and durable hardware.  The oxygen os 15 update made the software smoother and brought some cool features as well. Battery gives an excellent backup, charges quick, the display is great and flat. Also the metal design is unique.  The only downside, or might i say, a slight disappointment is the camera. Not that good at this price. Still and over-all great one. Not even noticeable to the average user. Apart from that, One plus nailed it.",POSITIVE
"This is my first OnePlus device, before this iam user of poco believe me oxygen OS is far better than miui/ Hyper os. It's lag free,and very smoothly work, battery is al great, camera is not upto mark but ok. Performance is next level iam loving with it😎",POSITIVE
"I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4. It is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. I bought this phone during Great Indian festival after so much research and doubts. I was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. I was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. I don't want to compromise in any one thing. So after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. But in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. Curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. Now i feel it was the best decision. Best features of this Nord 4 are- Design - I literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. I thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. It cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all. Performance - It has the best performance and able to play BGMI so smoothly. Flat screen helps so much in games also. Battery - If you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins. Camera - I felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. If camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, Samsung or Iphone which are camera centric. But then other areas you have to compromise. Trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos. Network - Being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. Never felt any Issues at all. Display - It has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.  This review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for Oneplus Nord 4 for sure. Greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....  (If any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)",POSITIVE
"I've never had a OnePlus device before so I'll be totally unbiased over my experience for this phone since I bought it by the time of of first day launch🤗  1) Design: (9.5/10 Subjective) I love it but t's subjective is you prefer a glass built over a metal or the dual tone colours/texture appeals you less or more, but ultimately it's one of the most eye catching designs launched this year apart from the Nothing phones that has managed to attain a premium appearance in a very simple unibody structure.  2) Performance: (8.5/10) This is what makes it one of the top competitors within the 30k lineup phones. I personally play a lot of gatcha games like Genshin, Honkai and Wuthering Waves, over fps shooting so I would definitely say that gatcha games being heavier in graphics, Nord 4 is capable to provide the most efficient gaming. Practically speaking if you avoid those YouTube reviews with AnTuTu, any android phone would at some point face fps drop if you play in the highest settings and I do believe with what I've heard that even with high end processors like Snapdragon 7+ 3, OnePlus always limits it's potential which is why we do get to see some throttling, but on a long term it doesn't matter. If you are a daily user with 2-3 hours of heavy gaming per day or more with breaks after every 45 minutes to 1 hour of heavy graphic gameplay, then you could definitely have a great experience. If you are just a normal user, you can choose it blindly.  3) Built and UI: (9/10 for strength and quality but 7/10 for being expensive to replace) Ofcourse being metal you would expect a little bit of weight (around 200 grams) but you get used to it and it really feels much premium to feel that metallic weight in your hand. It might get really slippery and if it falls down it might not have scratches except for the glass portion around the camera but might face dents on the metal if the fall is too harsh, so I would suggest to have a back cover, and let's be honest no matter how premium the phone is even if it looks great, they are all at the end of the day sensitive and how you manage to care for it depends totally on you. Be responsible. And as I mentioned, it's going to be really expensive to replace a unibody metal frame if it's cracked or dented even if it's strong enough to work so be careful. As for the UI I've been a Xiaomi user so honestly I don't feel much different in terms of operating system with bloatware, but I really don't feel bothered by it as long as I'm able to disable it. I uninstalled and disabled not almost but EVERY single bloatware in this phone that I possibly could have including app market and even the gaming tool so now I don't get those security checks after installing apps and it feels as clean as any Flagship phone.  3) Battery: (8/10) It's good. Definitely better battery life than my iPhone BUT for how big the battery is, the Oxygen OS hasn't optimised it's battery life to it's maximum just as I mentioned before for its Processor but it's not a big deal. 5500mAH is something we see less as the price goes higher over handheld devices because they try to add more space for gimmicks like wireless charging which in my opinion is not very practical everytime unless you carry a wireless charger everywhere and they are really slow. But the wired charging in OnePlus with the 100 watt out of the box charger is great and it charges the device to full within 30 minutes tho I would suggest to toggle the option from Battery Health settings to charge it till 80 percentage so you can keep it's battery health stable for long. I hope they optimise it in the future updates but honestly it gives you around 7-8 hours of life with regular usage and even more if you are a light user which is more than enough considering that at some point you will need to charge your device any way.  4) Display: (8/10) It's a very smooth 120hz amoled panel with HDR support in Netflix that I never really use because I watch on my MacBook or the television (it's just better to watch anything on a bigger display over a phone to keep your visions safe) and an unnamed protection (Panda glass according to few sources) but I'll be practical over how much it actually matters. Being someone who has changed the displays in the past after getting it broken, it doesn't matter what Gorilla glass they put on your phone, it's a glass at the end of the day and if you are not being responsible enough by handling your phone with care, it's expected for your screen to face damage. Use a good tempered glass around 3-4 USD (200-400 INR) I won't suggest to go higher because no matter how expensive it is, even if it's able to handle a bend test, practically any tempered display is penetrable if it falls flat on a rough surface UNLESS you have a good thick back cover. Overall it's a good display but I feel that the brightness could be a bit bother outside if you live in a heavily bright environment. Personally I didn't face any issues for the time being as the peak brightness is really good in the sunlight but if you compare it to some cheaper devices, it might feel a little less.  5) Heating Stabilization: (9/10) I mean, it's metal? Ofcourse it's going to be hot DURING a gameplay but HEATING DOESN'T MEAN PERFORMANCE DROP. Also it's during the time when you are playing or doing some heavy task but the best part of metal is that it cools down as fast as it heats up and the cooling chamber in this phone is really efficient. Overall It's definitely better in terms of heat stabilization than any glass/plastic built phones for being a metal although I would say that, if you are travelling in a constantly hot temperature, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight for too long as it might get hot or else again, Use a back cover. BUT I'd also suggest to not use a back cover when doing some heavy gaming because it makes you loose the purpose of having a metal phone with such a good heating stabilization as plastic makes it harder to escape the heat.  6) Camera: (7/10 Subjective) This isn't my place but I would still give some opinion. It is decent and when I say that, it is actually not bad at all infact really good along it's limitations. It has a very natural tone on the back camera with a really good potrait mode and a decent front camera definitely better than a 25k phone but ofcourse with the specifications you see, there are limitations if you compare it to other phones in the same price. It's definitely better than Nothing 2a in terms of color and stability but not as close to camera centred phones like Vivo/Realme in the midrange but then again those phones lack either performance or the brand value, as OnePlus is much premium as a brand than Vivo/Realme even if they are from the same company. Again it is subjective and this phone in my opinion is rather a balance of performance along with the things you need in a midrange close-to-flagship phone rather than being an entire camera phone, but it's still really good even with the limitations of telephoto and other things that I find gimmick because I'm not a camera phone user.  Overall: (8.25) It's a great phone for both everyday users and decent to heavy gamers. I might score it higher in the future if they successfully optimise the Operating system in the future updates and push it to 9 even with a decent camera because this phone has a lot of potential and considering it's future update promises of 4+6 for Android and security patch, it's a very good purchase. Just praying that these phones don't face any green line issues in the future.",POSITIVE

"The mobile phone holder is not able to hold my iphone upright and the holder keeps slipping and is not sturdy as advertised. It cannot be adjusted to our required angle and keeps slipping.

Additionally, 10 brightness levels allow for precise control over the lighting, which is a big plus.

The 360° rotating lamp column ensures that I can adjust the light in any direction effortlessly, making it ideal for both desk work and general room lighting. The overall grip on the table is pretty decent. Its full metal body feels premium. The light part can hold itself in any position you want to.

"Sounce Foldable Portable Phone Holder Stand (Black)  I recently purchased the Sounce Foldable Portable Phone Holder Stand, and it has exceeded my expectations in terms of functionality and convenience. Here's my detailed review:  Pros:  1. Foldable and Portable Design: The compact and foldable design makes it easy to carry in a bag or even a pocket. Perfect for travel or office use.  2. Height Adjustable Cradle: The adjustable height feature is a game-changer. It allows for comfortable viewing angles, whether I’m watching videos, attending video calls, or reading.  3. Sturdy Build Quality: Despite being lightweight, the stand is very stable. It holds my phone securely without any wobbling, even when typing on the screen.  4. Compatibility: It works perfectly with a range of smartphones from 4 to 8 inches. I tested it with both an iPhone and an Android device, and it performed flawlessly.  5. User-Friendly: It’s extremely easy to set up and use. The foldable mechanism operates smoothly, and the non-slip pads ensure the phone stays in place.  Cons:  Limited Color Options: While the black version looks sleek, additional color options would have been a nice touch.

Overall Verdict:  The Sounce Foldable Portable Phone Holder Stand is a fantastic accessory for anyone looking for a stable, adjustable, and portable stand for their smartphone. It offers excellent value for the price and is ideal for both casual and professional use. Highly recommended!  Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)",POSITIVE

I'm writing this review after using it 3 months. I bought first time LAVA company mobile..  Sabse badi problem hai ki ye phone bahut slow hai or boht zyada hang karta hai. CAMERA front and back is not upto the mark. Front camera to bahut hi bekar hai.. night photography k liye to bilkul useless hai. BATTERY light use karne par bhi jaldi discharge ho jati hai and full charging time is 1hr 45 minute. Sirf look hi theek hai.. baki sab bakwas. LAVA Pathetic company and pathetic mobile.. Don't buy this if you don't want to waste your money. Your piece of mind will also disturb after buying this. Better spend 4 to 5 thousand more and go for iqoo Z9s Thanks,NEGATIVE

The screen size is very perfect and it feels very light and comfortable in the hand. The design is very premium and it has glass on both front and back. It feels very premium. The camera is ok, nothing much to talk about. Lava has produced such an excellent smartphone at this price point. I have become a fan of Lava for producing such a good product.

I literally searched a lot and ended up buying this cover by seeing the reviews and after using it I can agree that it is ALL WORTH IT. Kept my phone completely seal packed throughout (even in great depths). Just does its job and I was able to use my phone while it was packed and it was also recording surround voice and video quality was as usual as without the cover. Just go for it now stop reading more reviews.,POSITIVE
One when broaken after one use. Value for money. Useful for lesser use.,NEGATIVE
Super quality nice cover with water proof,POSITIVE
"For using the phone in the bathroom, this product is great. But for using it in water park or beaches it is a definite no. The opening is not properly tightened enough to prevent the water from seeping inside.",NEGATIVE
Nice quality. Highly recommended,POSITIVE
"Immediately after receiving the product, the first thing I did was kept a phone size item inside and put it under the tap and then tried again by keeping it in a bucket. Water seeps inside in small droplets. Definitely not going to use it for my phone. Not worth risking my 35k phone. Returning the product. Also it's made in China.",NEGATIVE
"Well, the product does what it says and stays dry inside but yes don’t forget to test it before putting your phone inside and submerging it inside water. The cord hook is weak and if using it for like during jetski beware about it as it may break on moderate jerk.",NEGATIVE
I have used this in heavy rainfall and my mobile was fully protected.  And the touch screen of the mobile also works great even inside the pouch.  It's a good product.,POSITIVE

"🔹 Design & Build: Compact and sleek in black, the Portronics Car Power 16 fits snugly in any car charging port.

"The product is made plastic but the quality is realy nice..... Also it supports fast charge for many devices I tried the USB A port (18W) for my redmi phone It showed the text of ""Quick Charging "" ( text used for 18w charging in redmi and poco phones) while charging.  I don't have a Type c to c cable to test the other port. But it says that it supports 33w max charge.  Overall a great value for money product. I would have given it 5stars if they provided a compatible cable with the charger as other close competitors such as ambrane are also providing. But its not a negative poimt for the product. The product is really awesome....",POSITIVE
Value of money product. And build quality is very good,POSITIVE
Super and super fast charging super and quality worth for money i use 6 moths longer,NEGATIVE
"I’ve been using the Portronics 51W car charger, and it’s honestly amazing. It’s super compact but charges my phone and tablet really fast with its USB-C PD and QC 3.0 ports. I love that I can charge two devices at the same time without any overheating issues. It feels sturdy and reliable, making it perfect for my long drives.",POSITIVE
"I'm thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. Boasting an impressive 51-watt capacity, split between 33 watts via the Type-C port and 18 watts via the USB port.  Pros:  Fast Charging: The standout feature of this charger is its ability to charge devices at high speed. Whether it's my smartphone ortablet, this charger handles the task with ease. Dual Charging Ports: The inclusion of both a Type-C and a USB port is incredibly convenient. I can charge my latest Type-C devices while simultaneously powering up older gadgets with the traditional USB-A port, making it perfect for all my devices. Sturdy Build: The charger feels well-built and durable, promising a long lifespan. The compact design also ensures it fits snugly into the car's power outlet without obstructing other ports or controls. Safety Features: These give me peace of mind while charging my expensive devices, knowing they won't get damaged due to any power surges or overheating.  Cons:  Materials Could Be Better: While the charger's overall build is sturdy, it would be even more impressive if it incorporated higher-quality materials. A more premium feel would match its performance and enhance its overall appeal. But i can not complaint at this price. Limited Type-C Power: Although the Type-C port provides a commendable 33 watts, it would have been even better if it could handle a higher power output. Some flagship devices are capable of drawing more power for optimal charging speeds.  Compatibility: Working seamlessly with all Android and iPhone models. Tested on oneplus,xiaomi, poco, iphone 13pro and iphone 14.  Overall, the Charger has proven to be a reliable companion for my daily commute and road trips. While it could benefit from higher-quality materials and a slightly increased Type-C power output, these considerations are relatively minor compared to the convenience and efficiency it offers and what it offers at this budget.  I would recommend this car charger to anyone in need of a reliable, fast-charging solution for their smartphones, tablets, and other gadgets while on the road. It's an essential accessory for modern-day travelers and tech enthusiasts alike.",POSITIVE
Good charger but if used both ports then is not giving 65 w PD. So with both ports it's useless for laptop charging. It's getting hot.,NEGATIVE
It has fast charging and an LED light so that we don’t struggle for connecting the cable. Awesome product. Looks sleek and premium as well.,POSITIVE

Better to go for a more sturdy one  Edit 11.11.2024 Actually, I forgot that the small button is for android. I was connecting it to my google pixel and then using the big button meant for iphone and i think this was causing frequent disconnection.  Now, just using the small button and it is working ok, except for a few times when connection is lost and I switch it off and then on again to use it.

"I snagged the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival for an unbeatable price of 45,000, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in every way!  Screen: The display is absolutely stunning – crisp, vibrant, and the colors pop like never before. Watching videos or scrolling through photos is a treat for the eyes. No complaints here!  Hanging: Zero issues with hanging or lagging. This phone handles multitasking like a champ. Switching between apps is smooth, and I haven't experienced any frustrating delays.  Battery: The battery life is surprisingly impressive. I can go a full day with normal usage, and it still has juice left in the tank. No more anxiously searching for a charger midday – a definite win!  Comfort: The sleek design makes it a pleasure to hold, and the phone is just the right weight. It feels premium and comfortable in my hand, making it a joy to use for extended periods.  Image Quality: The camera on the iPhone 13 is a true standout. The photos are sharp, and the night mode is a game-changer for capturing memories in low light. Selfies have never looked this good!  Color: I went for the classic Midnight color, and it's elegant and timeless. The finish adds a touch of sophistication, and it doesn't attract fingerprints like some other phones I've had in the past.

"I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.  The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”  The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.  If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!",POSITIVE
Excellent power services. Power consumption is very less. Battery charging very quick. Performance is very good in comparison to device's price. Taking into account of sounds brightness display quality etc overall performance is commendable. A good product.,POSITIVE
"I don’t have words to explain the quality of camera, only can say it is pathetic, poor, disgusting etc. I have connected with their team also and they told me that they can’t do any thing as camera will provide this type of pic only. I will suggest please don’t buy Redmi Note 14 mobile it is totally wastage of money and they are fooling by saying it is 50mp camera; however my old mobile provide better pic. I am going to request to Amazon also please don’t keep these type of low standard product which are costing so much. I am never going to buy electronic product from Amazon because if quality of product is not good u can’t return it and ur hard earned money will go to waste and will suggest my family and friends also not to buy electronic product from Amazon.",NEGATIVE

"This is post 3 days of using of phone and simply couldn't resist myself from writing this review. Got the Razor Green 12 GB 512 GB for 32K post Bank discount. Adding some context before diving into my experience. I was an S22 Ultra user and ditched the same for OnePlus 12 SD8G3. I wanted an add on phone for office use and for gaming (BGMI & MKX). Got this one post going through round of comparisons against IQOOs out there. Not I just had one sim in the phone as I was using it. So coming straight to how I rate this phone. It is a 5/5 for me. Looks: 4/5 ✌️✌️✌️✌️ Display: 5/5 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Touch Response: 5/5 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈 Performance: 5/5 ✨✨✨✨✨ Gaming performance: 5/5 👍👍👍👍👍 Speaker Output: 5/5 ( very decent) Battery: 10/5 ( Simply marvellous) Charging speed: 15/5 (no comments) Camera: 4/5 (boosted this up from 3 to 4 based off overall happiness with the phone and considering the price factor) OS: 4/5 (-1 because of few preloaded apps) Finger print scanner: 5/5  So what I loved: Display and performance crisp and buttery smooth. OS is clean too to the most. SD7+G3 takes on any tasks thrown on it with ease. No hassles in multitasking. Got July security patch as of yesterday so all good on that front too. Now speaking about what I'm in love with - Being an S22 Ultra user I must say the biggest pain point has been battery since day 1. Max gaming time 3.5 Hrs. in the initial days which reduced to 1.5 over a span of 2 years. Stand-by was crazy bad too on S22 Ultra. This Lil gizmo GT 6T is a dream in this case. 3 days of game play BGMI 5 Hrs. each day and was left with 22% of juice still remaining each time. And post sleep of 6 hrs. the phone still retained 17% of charge. This already is insane in my perspective. Now coming to the charging aspect, this is unimaginable. Lightning fast... 17% - 100% in 22 minutes. Speechless in this front. Sammy used to take like 1 hr and 10 mins. in the initial days and post an year and half I really don't know. Gaming done without gtmode. Frame rate was set to auto adaptive. BGMI played in Smooth Extreme+. Brightness at ~45%. No throttling or heating. It got slightly warm at a point (really no where close to be called as heating) and then cooled too which is 😍😍😍. WhatsApp, FB, Insta, Gmail, O365, Teams and all other apps on the background. So you can go for this one blindfolded if you are looking for a phone with great backup and performance (gaming performance). I hope this is helpful. What I didn't like: Given all of above a 3.5 mm slot was expected. And sound output in headphones could have been better. I used Sony WH1000XM3 for gaming and Wf1000XM4 for listening to music and watching movie to test the output. Again you can hear all the footsteps and minute details and same applies to music if not all details but covers 90% of it but somewhere lacks the loudness factor by a bit and no Dolby Atmos so less to mention there. Lastly, I didn't cover anything on cam perspective because I was really not looking at this phone from that aspect and me sharing my experience on that front will definitely make no sense as the comparison will be against S22 Ultra here and this reaches no where close to it which is completely fine given it is not even 1/4th of the price for which I had bought S22 Ultra. That said both front and rear cam are decent is all I can say from price point perspective. Overall this is a bang on deal from my perspective and would definitely recommend going for it if you are not cam centric and looking for a great performer!",NEGATIVE
"Great curved screen and elegant design, amazing performance! Good for BGMI game to play @90fps(tested) without any lag by enabling GT mode🤩🥳  Cameras are big and entire back looks very premium but, the brand provided case is of no use because of its big space to showcase the cameras entire area😤 it looks awkward with that case on🤮 I recommend The GiftKart liquid silicon back case(black) which costed me 299/- its a good case that provides utmost security and also proper grip, it gives a premium look and feel for the mobile by covering all the unnecessary gaps..  I am glad that I have availed the discount coupon of 7k that was available for some period on amazon and bought the mobile for ₹23,998/- and I am super happy🥳😍 Great sound and screen, the cameras also amazing and captures best shots📸🏞️  I have used all brands from Nokia to Apple. My majority mobiles was of Nokia, LG, Samsung, Motorola and Apple 5S.. Then One+ 3t, iPhone Xr and now from last 2 years with iPhone 12.  I have bought Mi max, Vivo, Poco X3, Realme GT Neo 3 and Motorola g54 mobiles for my wife so far to play PUBG/BGMI often with my kids as well and now bought this Realme GT 6t🥳😁..  I have used lots of mobile phones and now I can say this is the best, one can get under 31k price tag! If you get it lower than that, you’re damn lucky🥳😍😎🕺🏻…  Note: The design, looks and colours are depends on individual tastes but, the mobile phone is definitely a power packed all rounder🔥🔥🔥",POSITIVE
Good and handy phone Good Camera. Great Display and sound quality Smooth and powerful performance. 7-8 hours Screen on time with normal use.,POSITIVE
"I was searching for smartphone for a long time because my old smartphone (2019 bought) becoming aged and getting slowed down, on my research i was impression that either i would go with a lower mid range smartphone or a premium (preferable samsung) smartphone.  So i was not sure that what i have to purchase but my preferences was (in descending order) Battery 🔋+ charging speed Performance (upgrade from SD855) Storage Screen brightness (out visibility must be good) 5G bands atleast 10 (most usable) UI (software, atleast acceptable)  Overall if these check boxes are ticked ✅ (rest things comes complimentary).  So this query bring me the following smartphones at similar prices. 1. POCO F6 12/512 2. Realme GT 6T 8/256 3. OnePlus Nord 4 8/128  However Poco is powerful among these with FLAT SCREEN but we all know why many avoid poco, so left with two options Realme or OnePlus then again OnePlus green line mass problem forced me to think twice and decided to go with Realme GT 6T with curved screen (with the thought that if i disliked it even slightly, I'll sell it within days).  So Waited for BBD/Geart indian festival SALES Keeping all phones on list because if prices get's uneven (due to massive discount) then preferences will again change.  The day arrived got hige discount on POCO but till then i had made my mind to go with Realme (overall good software with everything balanced and compromising on Screen because it's a curved screen).  Ordered this RELAME GT 6T 8/256GB variant (Green looks sober, classy and not too shiny)  Then new fear unlock seeing Delivery frauds (some accuses seller, some accuses delivery partner and so on) researched about this. And was waiting for delivery with All the guns (safety measures) loaded.  Parcel arrived Talked with delivery guy, told him the seller/delivery frauds, he was a really nice guy, listened carefully and helped me to check ✅ parcel thoroughly after inspection we concluded that parcel (high security packaging) is TEMPERED, is strongly recommended me to cancel because it is high-value package so don't take risk  We proceeded with cancellation provided OTP for cancellation, order cancelled successfully. Within seconds he realises that package we looking was different and we cancelled my package, i was like (abbey, Harmonium) oh brother. Then i asked to check my parcel packaging and to my surprise that too was tempered (high security packaging considered tempered with when white line don't appear clearly or turns color PINK/GREEN with clearly visible side numbers) so i was relaxed that it's okay  But i had second thought and asked him to see if he can still deliver my package, he was looking to try to deliver package even after cancellation, he tried to send otp for delivery but no luck because OTP not received (tried multiple times),  I lost the hope and about ti leave the spot then he told me to wait, he called to warehouse operator asked him if he can mark this cancelled package as delivered, he said YES, within seconds he marked order delivered and package handover to me. Then i realised OTP thing also caused due to network, so Turned on flight ✈️ mode on then off, just afte that recieved 5 OTP messages. Told him this, he said no problem backend delievery system don't need OTP,  I Left the spot, thinking that i have made a big (costly) mistake, because Amazon don't offer open box delivery and often deny Returns (service centre replacement policy).  Reached into room, placed package on table, turned on Camera, inspected everything on camera. I was too nervous to open the box.  Just started to open and when i seen phone box with security seal and plastic sheet over the box (some relief).  Carefully open phone box and took BEAST into my Hand 👌🏽👌🏽, That look was amazing 🤩 Everything sorted.  💥🌟💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨✨💥✨💥✨💥✨💥✨ DEVICE-REVIEW-HERE DEVICE-REVIEW-HERE  Review part: • Battery [9hrs with 5G always on with auto Refresh Rate and with mixed Wi-Fi+5G usage 12+hrs]🔋+charging (I'm not going back to slow charging again ever) • Performance is really beast (more than expected) • Screen brightness 🔅 SUPER AMAZING • UI (after removing and disabling bloats) amazing • Speaker and camera also good (but low light camera performance is not good)  Overall I'm with this beast for next few years (maybe 5yrs) if everything went as usual.  Build quality is plastic and finger prints are visible if Cover or skin not applied.  However i still feel if this had FLAT screen it would be blind suggestion for everyone (normal/casual user).  Call quality is excellent, Google dialer comes default but can be changed to Odialer for call recording.  I felt if someone who use multiple apps (more than 10 except calls/sms/email/Play Store) for daily usage, needs to tweak battery settings for every single app to achieve optimal battery backup else would face battery drain issues (faced this but that was once in a month kind thing).  Overall no battery drain or charging issues, no issues with calls (I'm using jio). Day light video/photography is better.  Overall a BEAST I bought 8/256 @ 26k (with card discount). Please vote up 👍🏽 if you find it helpful.  Thanks",NEGATIVE
"The DJI Osmo Mobile 6 is a lightweight, foldable smartphone gimbal with excellent stabilization and an intuitive design.

Video stability is unmatchable,NEGATIVE
"1. “Absolutely Terrible Product and Service!” I purchased the DJI gimbal, and it stopped working after just a few uses. When I tried to get it fixed, I realized there isn’t a single service center that could help. I’ve contacted support multiple times, but the issue remains unresolved. This is the worst investment I’ve ever made. Save your money and go for a brand with better customer service. 2. “Waste of Money - No Support Available!” The DJI gimbal I bought turned out to be a complete waste. It malfunctioned almost immediately, and to my shock, there are no service centers available to fix it. I’ve been left with an expensive paperweight. I’m beyond frustrated with this purchase. DJI seriously needs to improve their customer support and service network. 3. “Do Not Buy - Faulty Product and No Help!” I regret buying the DJI gimbal. It stopped working within weeks, and there’s no service center to fix the problem. I’ve tried everything, but I’m left with a defective product and no solution. This has been my worst investment to date. Avoid this product at all costs! 4. “DJI Gimbal - The Worst Investment I’ve Made!”",NEGATIVE
I tried to search dji mimo in play store but I couldn't find and I tried to search in dji website and downloaded apk and tried to install in my realme mobile and it was awesome but when I tried to install in my s23 ultra I suggested me to turn of auto blocker in security and privacy setting Then I surf to Google that why it was removed from playstore then I known that due to security and privacy it was removed so that's why I'm returning the product  Other wise it was good,NEGATIVE
Works really great. DJI products are amazing as always. Very handy and easy to use provides awesome stability,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 Gimbal Stabilizer for my iPhone 15 Pro Max, which is encased in a bulky OtterBox Defender XT case. I must say, this product has exceeded my expectations in every way.  First and foremost, the compatibility with my phone and case is flawless. I was initially concerned that the size and weight of my phone, combined with the case, might pose a challenge for the gimbal. However, the Osmo Mobile 6 handled it with ease. My phone securely fits in the clamp, and the gimbal maintains stable and smooth footage, even during fast movements.  The 3-axis stabilization technology is outstanding, providing incredibly steady shots that look professional and cinematic. Whether I'm shooting vlogs, capturing family moments, or creating content for YouTube and TikTok, this gimbal ensures my videos are always rock-steady.  The built-in extension rod is a fantastic addition, making it even easier to get those hard-to-reach angles and creative shots. It adds versatility to my content creation without the need for additional equipment.  Object tracking is a handy feature that works accurately and consistently, keeping your subject in focus as you move the gimbal around. This has improved my video production quality significantly.  The foldable and portable design of the Osmo Mobile 6 is a real plus. It's easy to carry in a bag or even your pocket, making it perfect for on-the-go shooting.  The sleek slate gray color gives it a modern and premium look.  In summary, if you're using an iPhone 15 Pro Max with an OtterBox Defender XT case and are looking for a high-quality gimbal stabilizer, the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 is an excellent choice. It's reliable, versatile, and delivers outstanding results. I'm extremely satisfied with this product and highly recommend it to fellow content creators and smartphone videographers.",POSITIVE

Charging spped is good but i recommend using 10/18W charger to charge it at night so u will maintain good battery health for very longtime. Cpu is extremely optimized it doesn't throttle but whereas GPU throttles in Gpu benchmarks which doesnt occur at gaming so u dont need to worry about that. Camera is OK Ok not perfect but no bad too. No panel gaps.  Cons: Software i say its not much of premium and i recommend many of them to not to update it and keep it stock software.",POSITIVE

This phone is an absolute powerhouse—whether it’s gaming, multitasking, or just casual scrolling, it handles everything like a pro. 💪 The Snapdragon chip inside makes it lightning fast ⚡, and the AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate is buttery smooth.

It’s clean, smooth, and pretty user-friendly. I also took extra precautions with my personal data, and so far, no issues! 👌  If you’re looking for a phone that’s a perfect mix of performance, style, and value, the iQOO 13 is a no-brainer. Highly recommended! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",POSITIVE
"I have 16gb/516 . Few things what I experienced 1 In this price it is way better and beautiful phone. 2 BGMI works in 120Hz by default and can go upto 144 hz and it feels so defferent and u have better upper hand in this game. 3 camera is also very good.works in all day night. 4 battery is 6000Mah and charger is 120 watt it takes 30 minutes to charge from 0-100 and and last for a day or more depending upon ur usage. 5 Screen is very bright in pure day light too under extreme sunlight and can use extra dimming for pure dark . 6 Sound is very punchy and loud , 7 Dynamic light on the camera rings feels premium. 8 Snapdragon 8 elite is way faster than others no heating issue .  There is 1 major drawback which I felt Although the ultra Sonic finger print works way faster than optical finger print and it works well with even wet hand BUT.......it does not work when u apply any screen guard it never recognise ur finger no matters which screen guard u apply it only works with thin paper screen guard only at present there is no settings to overcome this flaw.  Rest phone is very fast beautiful,handy and looks premium with all the latest features.",POSITIVE

Fast and very accurate finger print reading. It has proper curved display. It will be difficult to maintain this. And you'll never find a satisfactory screen guard ever. But that was expected. But the display is aesthetically pleasing. In-hand feel also is just amazing with no sharp edges.  5000+ battery - it last to the second day easily. And 80W power adaptor charges it in around 30 minutes to full.!!!  Under 25000 Rs. its a great value for money device. And iQOO brand, I felt, is very reliable. This is my second iQOO phone.

Yeah! iQOO z9spro 5g is the phone who is looking for a good sleek design and moderate gamers and good battery life with an above average camera . I think the phone design is much better I feels iQOO z7 pro is a good design and overall phone It is an upgrade version of the last gen and in-hand hand feel is awesome and if you want good phone around 25k it's the allrounder than grab it ⭐⭐⭐1/2 it's my rating to these funtouch os may improve further. So thank you Vivo for bringing these phones at these price range.,POSITIVE
"This phone is one of the best options in its segment, offering an exceptional display with vibrant colors and sharp clarity. The camera performance is outstanding, capturing detailed and crisp photos in various lighting conditions. In terms of performance, it handles multitasking and gaming effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for everyday use. While the overall experience is fantastic, I found the speakers to be slightly underwhelming. However, this is a minor drawback in an otherwise excellent device that delivers on almost every front.""",POSITIVE
"I gave it 4 stars. The selfie camera could have been better. The battery is good, the back camera is also good. I am giving a review after using it for 9 days. This mobile is okay for this price.",POSITIVE
One of the best mobile you can get in this range! The camera quality is good.. It has small display at back which if you have desk job and you listen to songs or see notification or anything.. It is good and action key is my favourite as I can customize as I want. Charging is fast and battery power is also good. Clean android and amazing display also.. Hoping they keep improving with time! No heating issue! In display fingerprint sensor is also amazing. No issue with connectivity 👍,POSITIVE
"The design and feel of this smartphone is incredible with matt glass back and curved screen. The steel metal rails on edges are shiny and look really premium. Great build quality overall.  Camera island gives a nice symmetrical look, also good grip area. The back screen is very useful for using main camera for photo. It also has Always on display option for back display. Could have been more customisable with cutom images/more animations.  Performace is great, no lags, no heat very efficient 4nm tsmc processor with only 2.5 ghz so no problem with battery life. Charging speed is very good 66 watts. It's my first 5g phone and experience is great. No battery issue with 5g very efficient there as well.  Beautiful Amoled screen is smooth, reponsive and vibrant. Brightness is decent. Great software experience. Action button is super useful! What a great addition.  Dual speaker are crisp and very useful. Sarisfied with camera quality, as I'm not a huge camera person, it's difficult to judge for me. OIS helps. Also, good vibration motor.  For cons -  No micro sd. Have to get 256 GB variant because of that. But, storage provided is good quality and fast ufs3.1  The button place is such that I accidently press the opposite button. Volume is opposite to lock and action button. It took some getting used to for me personally.",POSITIVE
"I have been using the phone for the last 3 months. Battery backup is huge, you would not get such powerful battery in anyother phone, Inscreen fingerprint sensor is mind blowing. Performance is great, never faced any issue, does not hand, no lagging - be advised I do not play high graphic hungry games like CODM or any other battle royales. There is absolutely no heating issue. Touch quality is smooth. One crutial thing that Lava needs to work on is the camera. They have provided the wide angle camera which is great but the issue lies in the primary camera. For apparent no reasons the camera would go out of focus and even after trying for many minutes will not correct itself. Another thing is the zoom, as soon as you go above 2x, the quality will go towards bad and light capturing decreases. Apart from these issues, the phone is great. the mini screen in the back is a nice addition.",POSITIVE
"I am proud of this company Lava.Because I was previously using Lava Agni 2. And my family members also have phones from the same company, Lava.Every phone from this company is working in the best possible way.

"Awesome mobile in this range, best decision, but Camera colour are good but not too much good.., battery is 5000mh but not enough because of two display. Fast charging, best quality, I use this mobile from 2 months and no problem I face.",POSITIVE
"Wow.. amazing phone in every aspect.. I have seen many bad reviews about camera on YouTube, but I still bought it by seeing other good qualities. But believe me, the camera is so good both front n back. Super clarity curved display. No other company can give you this much clarity n features at this price. Its worth more than its price. Fast charging. I bet you will be happy buying Lava Agni 3. Proudly Indian smartphone.",POSITIVE

I'm writing this review after using it 3 months. I bought first time LAVA company mobile..  Sabse badi problem hai ki ye phone bahut slow hai or boht zyada hang karta hai. CAMERA front and back is not upto the mark. Front camera to bahut hi bekar hai.. night photography k liye to bilkul useless hai. BATTERY light use karne par bhi jaldi discharge ho jati hai and full charging time is 1hr 45 minute. Sirf look hi theek hai.. baki sab bakwas. LAVA Pathetic company and pathetic mobile.. Don't buy this if you don't want to waste your money. Your piece of mind will also disturb after buying this. Better spend 4 to 5 thousand more and go for iqoo Z9s Thanks,NEGATIVE

"The mobile phone holder is not able to hold my iphone upright and the holder keeps slipping and is not sturdy as advertised. It cannot be adjusted to our required angle and keeps slipping. It is also advertised that it can hold a kindle reading pad, which i doubt, because it cannot manage the weight on my iphone. A very shoddy product.

Additionally, 10 brightness levels allow for precise control over the lighting, which is a big plus.  The USB-A connectivity is a great feature, as I can even power it using a power bank during outages—super convenient! The 360° rotating lamp column ensures that I can adjust the light in any direction effortlessly, making it ideal for both desk work and general room lighting. The overall grip on the table is pretty decent. Its full metal body feels premium. The light part can hold itself in any position you want to.  The design is sleek and premium, enhancing the overall aesthetics of my setup. I also appreciate the rubber pad on the mounting assembly, which prevents any scratches on my table. It’s clear that a lot of thought has gone into both design and functionality.  For the price, this lamp offers excellent value for money.

"Sounce Foldable Portable Phone Holder Stand (Black)  I recently purchased the Sounce Foldable Portable Phone Holder Stand, and it has exceeded my expectations in terms of functionality and convenience. Here's my detailed review:  Pros:  1. Foldable and Portable Design: The compact and foldable design makes it easy to carry in a bag or even a pocket. Perfect for travel or office use.  2. Height Adjustable Cradle: The adjustable height feature is a game-changer. It allows for comfortable viewing angles, whether I’m watching videos, attending video calls, or reading.  3. Sturdy Build Quality: Despite being lightweight, the stand is very stable. It holds my phone securely without any wobbling, even when typing on the screen.  4. Compatibility: It works perfectly with a range of smartphones from 4 to 8 inches. I tested it with both an iPhone and an Android device, and it performed flawlessly.  5. User-Friendly: It’s extremely easy to set up and use. The foldable mechanism operates smoothly, and the non-slip pads ensure the phone stays in place.  Cons:  Limited Color Options: While the black version looks sleek, additional color options would have been a nice touch.  Height Range: The height adjustment could be a bit more extensive for users who need higher positioning.  Overall Verdict:  The Sounce Foldable Portable Phone Holder Stand is a fantastic accessory for anyone looking for a stable, adjustable, and portable stand for their smartphone. It offers excellent value for the price and is ideal for both casual and professional use. Highly recommended!  Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)",POSITIVE
"The tripod is very easy to use, the build quality is nice , it is sturdy but the table clamp seems a little bit week",NEGATIVE
"Product design and material used is very sturdy, But need a correction in design for holding a weight of mobile or tablet, as I observed when we put a mobile on the stand the holders slowly slowly coming down towards ground because the stand is not able hold the weight at every angle Need a improvement in design or add a teeth based elbow to hold mobile irrespective of angle of holders",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased this mobile stand, and it has been a fantastic addition to my workspace. Its sleek, modern design and sturdy aluminum alloy build give it a premium feel, while the anti-slip base and silicone padding ensure both stability and device protection.

It’s compatible with a wide range of devices, including smartphones and small tablets, even with cases on. Lightweight and portable, it’s perfect for both home use and travel.

I literally searched a lot and ended up buying this cover by seeing the reviews and after using it I can agree that it is ALL WORTH IT. Kept my phone completely seal packed throughout (even in great depths). Just does its job and I was able to use my phone while it was packed and it was also recording surround voice and video quality was as usual as without the cover. Just go for it now stop reading more reviews.,POSITIVE

"For using the phone in the bathroom, this product is great. But for using it in water park or beaches it is a definite no. The opening is not properly tightened enough to prevent the water from seeping inside.",NEGATIVE
Nice quality. Highly recommended,POSITIVE
"Immediately after receiving the product, the first thing I did was kept a phone size item inside and put it under the tap and then tried again by keeping it in a bucket. Water seeps inside in small droplets. Definitely not going to use it for my phone. Not worth risking my 35k phone. Returning the product. Also it's made in China.",NEGATIVE
"Well, the product does what it says and stays dry inside but yes don’t forget to test it before putting your phone inside and submerging it inside water. The cord hook is weak and if using it for like during jetski beware about it as it may break on moderate jerk.",NEGATIVE
I have used this in heavy rainfall and my mobile was fully protected.  And the touch screen of the mobile also works great even inside the pouch.  It's a good product.,POSITIVE

"🔹 Design & Build: Compact and sleek in black, the Portronics Car Power 16 fits snugly in any car charging port. Its sturdy build ensures durability while traveling.  🔹 Charging Performance: ✔ 51W total output – (18W USB-A + 33W Type-C PD) for fast and efficient charging. ✔ Supports multiple devices – Works with iPhones, Androids, tablets, and other gadgets. ✔ Power Delivery (PD) Support – Ensures rapid charging for Type-C devices.  🔹 Safety Features: ✔ Smart chip protection against overvoltage, overheating, and short circuits. ✔ Automatically adjusts power output for safe charging.  🔹 Verdict: ✅ Pros: Fast charging, dual-port convenience, compact size, safe and reliable. ❌ Cons: No included cable, may not fast-charge all laptop models.  ⭐ Overall Rating: 4.5/5 – A great car",POSITIVE
"The product is made plastic but the quality is realy nice..... Also it supports fast charge for many devices I tried the USB A port (18W) for my redmi phone It showed the text of ""Quick Charging "" ( text used for 18w charging in redmi and poco phones) while charging.  I don't have a Type c to c cable to test the other port. But it says that it supports 33w max charge.  Overall a great value for money product. I would have given it 5stars if they provided a compatible cable with the charger as other close competitors such as ambrane are also providing. But its not a negative poimt for the product. The product is really awesome....",POSITIVE
Value of money product. And build quality is very good,POSITIVE
Super and super fast charging super and quality worth for money i use 6 moths longer,NEGATIVE
"I’ve been using the Portronics 51W car charger, and it’s honestly amazing. It’s super compact but charges my phone and tablet really fast with its USB-C PD and QC 3.0 ports. I love that I can charge two devices at the same time without any overheating issues. It feels sturdy and reliable, making it perfect for my long drives.",POSITIVE
"I'm thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. Boasting an impressive 51-watt capacity, split between 33 watts via the Type-C port and 18 watts via the USB port.  Pros:  Fast Charging: The standout feature of this charger is its ability to charge devices at high speed. Whether it's my smartphone ortablet, this charger handles the task with ease. Dual Charging Ports: The inclusion of both a Type-C and a USB port is incredibly convenient. I can charge my latest Type-C devices while simultaneously powering up older gadgets with the traditional USB-A port, making it perfect for all my devices. Sturdy Build: The charger feels well-built and durable, promising a long lifespan. The compact design also ensures it fits snugly into the car's power outlet without obstructing other ports or controls. Safety Features: These give me peace of mind while charging my expensive devices, knowing they won't get damaged due to any power surges or overheating.  Cons:  Materials Could Be Better: While the charger's overall build is sturdy, it would be even more impressive if it incorporated higher-quality materials. A more premium feel would match its performance and enhance its overall appeal. But i can not complaint at this price. Limited Type-C Power: Although the Type-C port provides a commendable 33 watts, it would have been even better if it could handle a higher power output. Some flagship devices are capable of drawing more power for optimal charging speeds.  Compatibility: Working seamlessly with all Android and iPhone models. Tested on oneplus,xiaomi, poco, iphone 13pro and iphone 14.  Overall, the Charger has proven to be a reliable companion for my daily commute and road trips. While it could benefit from higher-quality materials and a slightly increased Type-C power output, these considerations are relatively minor compared to the convenience and efficiency it offers and what it offers at this budget.  I would recommend this car charger to anyone in need of a reliable, fast-charging solution for their smartphones, tablets, and other gadgets while on the road. It's an essential accessory for modern-day travelers and tech enthusiasts alike.",POSITIVE
Good charger but if used both ports then is not giving 65 w PD. So with both ports it's useless for laptop charging. It's getting hot.,NEGATIVE
It has fast charging and an LED light so that we don’t struggle for connecting the cable. Awesome product. Looks sleek and premium as well.,POSITIVE

1.Camera quality is very poor. 2.Battery backup only half day 3. Audio not clear. 4. Tauch pad very poor. 5. Hanging problem. 6.No any Support from Technical Team or service centre Request you Not buy,NEGATIVE
A good looking phone. Unlike some other brands in this phone No bloatware No lag etc. Free from any annoying advertisements. The mini back side display is just a gizmo. Actually not a handy one. In fact sometimes it kills the privacy because for outgoing calls it shows the caller name till the end of the call. They should have implement a software switch to disable displaying caller name in the mini display while calling to another phone. This issue is not there for an incoming calls. Then the caller name will disappear from the mini display immediately after picking the call. Don’t know why they missed that case for incoming calls. Showing time and watch faces are useful though it is not necessary. Camera quality is good not best. No distortion on images even after transferring to laptop. 2k video recording is available but for stability a gimbal should be there. OIS is there to HD video recording. Good budget phone for beginner bloggers. Anonymous call record facility with Lava caller app.  Value for money product. One disadvantage is no back cover is available online in any site.

"Frnds I got this phone by exchange Colour:- Glass Viridian after 1 week use I posting this review positive:- First of all for this budget no one gives you 3D curve glass 👌 all of them saying rich look and stylish ,glorrila glass also good, smooth touch and weight is less , I thinked display will be mild smaller due to 6.67 but display is length wise big simply owesome. Back and FrontCamera is decent and clearity also ok and fast charging is good it takes only 1 hour maximum.For normal use camera backup one day is good. Performance also good Cons:- Peek brightness is very low when using in ☀️ light and battery is gets draining medium faster while watching YouTube and movies. When batery comes to below 15 percent it will speed mild charge lowing.  Note:- Use dark mode on for saving battery and charge only upto 85 percent for extent battery life pls don't on battery saver (after on only it will drain very faster)",NEGATIVE
I'm writing this review after using it 3 months. I bought first time LAVA company mobile..  Sabse badi problem hai ki ye phone bahut slow hai or boht zyada hang karta hai. CAMERA front and back is not upto the mark. Front camera to bahut hi bekar hai.. night photography k liye to bilkul useless hai. BATTERY light use karne par bhi jaldi discharge ho jati hai and full charging time is 1hr 45 minute. Sirf look hi theek hai.. baki sab bakwas. LAVA Pathetic company and pathetic mobile.. Don't buy this if you don't want to waste your money. Your piece of mind will also disturb after buying this. Better spend 4 to 5 thousand more and go for iqoo Z9s Thanks,NEGATIVE
"I'm posting this review after more than 3 weeks of usage. This is an excellent product at this price point. I bought this at 15500/- For 256 GB variant in sale with bank discounts. The Amoled display is amazing for this price point. Processor is excellent and it gives excellent performance at very good speed. The charging time is very fast. Sound Quality is very good with stereo speakers. The 5G connectivity is good. The battery life is excellent. It almost run for the whole day with heavy usage. The screen size is very perfect and it feels very light and comfortable in the hand. The design is very premium and it has glass on both front and back. It feels very premium. The camera is ok, nothing much to talk about. Lava has produced such an excellent smartphone at this price point. I have become a fan of Lava for producing such a good product. This is a Made in India product and I'm proud of it. I definitely recommend this Lava Blaze curve 5g Smartphone to everyone and it's worth every penny.",POSITIVE

"The product is nice..and tha base is wide and have good grips..does not slide ..have adjustable heights and angles..all is good but the hinges are slighlty loose ..that it cannot hold my fon in certain angle for long time..overtime the hinge will become so loose i guess..and while operation phone from the stand, it shakes for few seconds and comes back to normal ..other wise good value for money product ..i guess should improve the vertical rod quality…",NEGATIVE

"The phone is smooth there are no major bugs in the software however the ui could be more responsive, battery life is greatttt, I had no issues with performance, it didn't include the wide angle camera which could be a major thing to some people but the main camera takes very good photos which was not expected by me , screen is great, however I felt that the auto brightness features works a little late it would take time to adjust accordingly, one more thing it does not have a physical proximity sensor but till today since using it for 2 months I haven't face any issues during calls, if you are looking for a great performance, great battery and great screen phone this is the one for you.",POSITIVE

"Amazing smartphone! It has almost all the features what a smartphone user needed. I will not mention the prose only mention the cons for future buyers.. 1.

Valuable for money.. fast charging.. without curve is better option.. something curve option can't been click..,NEGATIVE
Using this phone from last 7 days. Look wise this phone is great and handy also. Back camera takes some boosted pics(Specially Green color) which some people may like. Selfie camera applies some beatification on images. Sound is clear and loud but bass is missing. UI is smooth but it filled with more bloat wares but thank god no Hot apps and Hot games. Network and Connectivity is well and good as of now. Battery is good but not great as compared to 5500 MAH battery. Charging speed is more than enough for me. You can expect the battery will last 1 day if you are a average user. It should have a memory card slot as it is a budget phone. The phone doesn't have any heating issue.,POSITIVE
"It is the phone with maximum features in this price range especially the halo light is amazing also gets 120 hz refresh rate also has amazing battery life, sound is really loud specially while using ultra volume mode. It has amazing 5G connectivity. The display quality is best in class. The gaming experience is also really good. Overall, the phone quality is amazing.",POSITIVE
I am going to write genuine review of oppo f27 5g not recommended to buy because bad quality of camera and performance and bettry draining rapidly. I also went for service centre but they hesitate to replace my handset because they consider my issues and told me that battery usually only for 8hr in oppo f27. There is only replace option available on amazon not return. Make sure,NEGATIVE
Good quality phone. Delivery was on time and I got the product as expected. Original and all. Phone itself is good and the free cover is pretty good quality surprisingly.,POSITIVE
"I have been using this mobile for two weeks so far. Pros: Good camera and video in 4k Not much lag while gaming Loud music Breathing effect 44w vooc super charging adaptor Cons: It doesn't come with 3.5mm jack for ear phones, you need to use type-c earphones. Battery drains faster with heavy use.",NEGATIVE

I gifted this oppo f27 5G phone to my friend on 9/9/2024 He did not opened till 11/10/2024. Yesterday I asked him to open the box and use the phone. Shockingly I am writing this review. Please do not buy this phone. Camera is really worst. Display quality is worst. Go for Samsung products please. I am a samsung m33 5G user. Samsung m33 5G Battery capacity and camera is awesome.

"I don’t have words to explain the quality of camera, only can say it is pathetic, poor, disgusting etc. I have connected with their team also and they told me that they can’t do any thing as camera will provide this type of pic only. I will suggest please don’t buy Redmi Note 14 mobile it is totally wastage of money and they are fooling by saying it is 50mp camera; however my old mobile provide better pic. I am going to request to Amazon also please don’t keep these type of low standard product which are costing so much. I am never going to buy electronic product from Amazon because if quality of product is not good u can’t return it and ur hard earned money will go to waste and will suggest my family and friends also not to buy electronic product from Amazon.",NEGATIVE

"After using it for more than 10 months, I can assure you that it is a poor quality product.  The bluetooth disconnects frequently.  Read the 2 star reviews before buying.  Better to go for a more sturdy one  Edit 11.11.2024 Actually, I forgot that the small button is for android. I was connecting it to my google pixel and then using the big button meant for iphone and i think this was causing frequent disconnection.  Now, just using the small button and it is working ok, except for a few times when connection is lost and I switch it off and then on again to use it.  Still not perfect and poor quality but working fine and I haven’t changed battery yet.",NEGATIVE
product recieved well packed. in working condition. simple function . easy to get connected with bluetooth. and vidio function is good. Regarding durability it is too early to comment. let me use for few days first then will give feedback,POSITIVE

Travel Friendly and easy to carry and click pictures,POSITIVE
One of the best mobile you can get in this range! The camera quality is good.. It has small display at back which if you have desk job and you listen to songs or see notification or anything.. It is good and action key is my favourite as I can customize as I want. Charging is fast and battery power is also good. Clean android and amazing display also.. Hoping they keep improving with time! No heating issue! In display fingerprint sensor is also amazing. No issue with connectivity 👍,POSITIVE
"The design and feel of this smartphone is incredible with matt glass back and curved screen. The steel metal rails on edges are shiny and look really premium. Great build quality overall.  Camera island gives a nice symmetrical look, also good grip area. The back screen is very useful for using main camera for photo. It also has Always on display option for back display. Could have been more customisable with cutom images/more animations.  Performace is great, no lags, no heat very efficient 4nm tsmc processor with only 2.5 ghz so no problem with battery life. Charging speed is very good 66 watts. It's my first 5g phone and experience is great. No battery issue with 5g very efficient there as well.  Beautiful Amoled screen is smooth, reponsive and vibrant. Brightness is decent. Great software experience. Action button is super useful! What a great addition.  Dual speaker are crisp and very useful. Sarisfied with camera quality, as I'm not a huge camera person, it's difficult to judge for me. OIS helps. Also, good vibration motor.  For cons -  No micro sd. Have to get 256 GB variant because of that. But, storage provided is good quality and fast ufs3.1  The button place is such that I accidently press the opposite button. Volume is opposite to lock and action button. It took some getting used to for me personally.",POSITIVE
"I have been using the phone for the last 3 months. Battery backup is huge, you would not get such powerful battery in anyother phone, Inscreen fingerprint sensor is mind blowing. Performance is great, never faced any issue, does not hand, no lagging - be advised I do not play high graphic hungry games like CODM or any other battle royales. There is absolutely no heating issue. Touch quality is smooth. One crutial thing that Lava needs to work on is the camera. They have provided the wide angle camera which is great but the issue lies in the primary camera. For apparent no reasons the camera would go out of focus and even after trying for many minutes will not correct itself. Another thing is the zoom, as soon as you go above 2x, the quality will go towards bad and light capturing decreases. Apart from these issues, the phone is great. the mini screen in the back is a nice addition.",POSITIVE
"I am proud of this company Lava.Because I was previously using Lava Agni 2. And my family members also have phones from the same company, Lava.Every phone from this company is working in the best possible way. And currently I have bought Lava Agni 3.And currently, while using the Lava Agni 3, every feature of this phone is surprising me. Because this company has made the best phone for such a low price.Lava Agni 3 has the best camera, best processor, best stereo speakers, best display, best battery life, best design and many more.... Best. Best.. Best I love India 🇮🇳 and. I LOVE LAVA #proudly Indian.",POSITIVE

"Awesome mobile in this range, best decision, but Camera colour are good but not too much good.., battery is 5000mh but not enough because of two display. Fast charging, best quality, I use this mobile from 2 months and no problem I face.",POSITIVE
"Wow.. amazing phone in every aspect.. I have seen many bad reviews about camera on YouTube, but I still bought it by seeing other good qualities. But believe me, the camera is so good both front n back. Super clarity curved display. No other company can give you this much clarity n features at this price. Its worth more than its price. Fast charging. I bet you will be happy buying Lava Agni 3. Proudly Indian smartphone.",POSITIVE
Overall phone experience is good but camera performance is poor . It has problem with camera optimization. You have to take 10 photos then you will get one or two good photos . Otherwise phone is good hepatics soo good .look wise osm. Sound quality is descent. I face No heating issue. Good connectivity . it will give you a primium experience in this price range .,POSITIVE
"I snagged the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival for an unbeatable price of 45,000, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in every way!  Screen: The display is absolutely stunning – crisp, vibrant, and the colors pop like never before. Watching videos or scrolling through photos is a treat for the eyes. No complaints here!  Hanging: Zero issues with hanging or lagging. This phone handles multitasking like a champ. Switching between apps is smooth, and I haven't experienced any frustrating delays.  Battery: The battery life is surprisingly impressive. I can go a full day with normal usage, and it still has juice left in the tank. No more anxiously searching for a charger midday – a definite win!  Comfort: The sleek design makes it a pleasure to hold, and the phone is just the right weight. It feels premium and comfortable in my hand, making it a joy to use for extended periods.  Image Quality: The camera on the iPhone 13 is a true standout. The photos are sharp, and the night mode is a game-changer for capturing memories in low light. Selfies have never looked this good!  Color: I went for the classic Midnight color, and it's elegant and timeless. The finish adds a touch of sophistication, and it doesn't attract fingerprints like some other phones I've had in the past.  In summary, getting the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival was an absolute steal. From the incredible screen to the reliable battery life and stunning camera, it's exceeded my expectations. If you're on the fence, take the plunge – you won't be disappointed.",POSITIVE
"I’m using my iphone 13 for more than one year,bought it for 44k on Great India festival sale 2k23, now it’s time for review Hardware and software quality is top notch Great screen quality except boring 60 hz But it’s not a deal breaker for Apple product Picture quality and specially video quality is top notch, according to price range the video quality of iphones are unmatchable till now , Battery backup is also good But in this 1 year battery health drop into 85 percent, no battery health problem seen in winter season but in summer season battery health drops a lot for getting heats up easily in Indian summer season, Best in class apple bionic Chipset is there so performance is top notch, U don’t have to worrying about performance wise means editing or gaming related task Haptics feedback are very premium and haptic implementations towards in this whole software in evey steps is just awesome feel , Security wise apple’s are best in the market so a big plus point is also here Overall a best value for money premium device till now in 2k24 also Till now good experience ❤️ Apple products specially iphones are performs best in little low temperature weather , Iphone’s only enemy is summer and hot weather, but after heating also the performance is top notch, it does not drop performance after heating also It’s a overall premium product with a premium pay as simply as it is I am satisfied with my decision ❤️ Hope this review will help you for buying iphones any model Thank you 😊",POSITIVE
"I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.  The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”  The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.  If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!",POSITIVE

"Good adhesive, attractive and value for money.",POSITIVE

Mobile charging. Perfect design. White colour. Sturdy plastic material.,POSITIVE
"I like it. Very useful as I have fixed it near a plug point and while charging also I can see who called etc and speak too after switching the charger off. Designed for most mobile sizes and has a long slot at the bottom for the charger cable even if the phone has it's charger point on the side instead of centre. Very neat and clean design.  Glue is good, it's still sticking to the wall. So far so good. I am happy and recommend it.",POSITIVE

The Harness is good but it woukd be better to do metal rather than cheap plastic.The hold to cheat is tight but mobile falls off in simple jerk.Not a product on which u can blindly trust.Its a hit ot miss and stable only on plain road with very less speed and without bumps.,NEGATIVE

Nice product,POSITIVE
"I recently tried the LIRAMARK Self-Adhesive Mobile Phone Charger, and unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations.  Firstly, the adhesive quality is poor; it didn’t stick well to surfaces, and after a short time, it began to peel away, making it nearly impossible to use effectively. The charging performance was also underwhelming—my phone charged slowly and sometimes wouldn’t connect at all unless I adjusted the positioning multiple times.  Additionally, the design felt clunky and didn’t fit well with my phone. It seemed more like an afterthought than a well-designed accessory. I also found the instructions to be unclear, which made installation frustrating.  Overall, I wouldn’t recommend the LIRAMARK Self-Adhesive Mobile Phone Charger. There are much better options available that offer reliable adhesion and charging performance.",NEGATIVE
Super product i liked it,POSITIVE
Good product and fast delivery but cost is very high,POSITIVE
It's very sturdy and useful product,POSITIVE
It is nice and best part is that it is too handy price bhi acha hai easy to use all in all sahi daam sahi kaam 👍👍👍👍,POSITIVE
It is a very helpful product. Although the manual is disappointingly unhelpful with lot of warning info and no info on how to use it. It was confusing to use the remote at first. But I learnt that it has to be press hold for 5 secs to activate and then pair with phone's Bluetooth. Also the USB is use to charge the led light. Usb port is at the top of the light. Although the extended version as selfie stick seemed to me that it not strong enough for my really heavy phone. But overall it works. As a stand its perfect. At this cost I think its totally worth its price.,POSITIVE
"High quality selfie stick with all options and easy to use for such an economical unbelievable price. Selfie light , detachable Bluetooth button, and tripod all are working fantastic. I highly appreciate the seller , thank you Amazon.",POSITIVE
"quality is ok ok, value for money",POSITIVE
"Total length of Stick is around 45cms. Including mobile holder it may come upto 55cms. Power of Selfie light is also very less, almost same as mobile flash. Connects only through bluetooth. Bluetooth button is removable. But unable to change bluetooth battery. Selfie light is micro usb chargeable. Non removeable selfie light.",NEGATIVE
"Good product, recommended for beginners, selfie stick is little hard to pull but other than that product is good considering the price range. One thing to remember is that you need to be carefully while handling this product as the build quality is not that great. So handle with care.",POSITIVE
"very poor quality, if you looking for standard one, this is not the product you looking for !!",NEGATIVE
"It's built decent. Packs a lot of features for its compact size. Has a rechargeable light for night selfies. The camera shutter runs on a button battery. Adjustable length, stepped rotation of the clamp, tripod mode, etc. everything works smoothly. The only con would be that it's not sturdy enough for bigger camera setup. The plastic used on the tripod stand looks fragile. Nevertheless, it's a value for money purchase for smartphone photographers👍",NEGATIVE

"Phone screen didnt come up when i started the phone, screen is distorted when receiving a call. Speaker quality is very much substandard. These are not like old Nokia phones!! poor than china phones!! But software is good, hardware is very poor!",NEGATIVE
Good product for the price as a feature phone. Value for money. Will update the Long term review after use.,POSITIVE
"Good points... Very light weight easy to use due to smoothest keypad Music player is sufficient Torch also satisfactory Music audio quality so so with built in speaker super battery backup  Bad Points Distorted voice in all calls Network reception not well (Airtel sim installed ) UPI feature not upto the mark with 2g Not good as old nokia phone (before 2015 models),Just feel like a updated Chinese phone with good pakaging. Its genuinely confirmed when opening file manager. Quality of voice/song not well with original nokia headphone even too less bass when connected with jbl headphone.  Thats all for my new nokia 106 dual sim 2g.  thanking you..",NEGATIVE

Battery drains fast even for normal use. Camera quality is ok for this budget. Battery 0 -100 in 50 min. Worth in this budget,POSITIVE
Looking good and performance of the phone is also best,POSITIVE
I purchased 3 phones (Not at the same time though) with-in our family. There are not more than 2 color variants. Only the 8GB version works okay for gaming and intense app/internet use (not a great work horse). 6GB works fairly. Speaker sound- okay and good camera quality. Phone functionality is good for intermediate usage....,POSITIVE

Good product. Value for money,POSITIVE
"Full time hanging, unable to call, everytime need to restart Mobile. Contact retrieval very slow. 8 gb 128 gb memory. Sms doesn't receive immediately. Need to restart Mobile every time it hangs. Hopeless. Loss of money. Inbuilt Contact app does not work properly , google contact app using, yet very slow. Twice reformatted yet no improvement. Try & buy some other brand",NEGATIVE
"Doesn't feel like a budget phone at all. Crisp display, powerful performance, superb response. You may or may not like the OS, for me it is perfect, decluttered, unlike a lot of other android phone or OS. Using it for over a couple of weeks now and pretty happy. Can do light gaming, on high performance mode (high graphics and frame rate) jitters a bit, which is why light gaming. Connectivity is good. Overall highly rated. Camera is fitting for budget, probably pales in comparison to to the other features provided in this phone. If someone is looking for a secondary phone then this should definitely be it.",POSITIVE
"I was using iPhone before and didn't want to switch to Android because I found them ugly and full of bloatware or just not near enough.  However now I am completely in awe of this phone. It is exactly the kind of phone that I needed in my life. It is not at all snobbish and eveil like iPhone or lousy and vulgar like most other Androids that I have used before.  It is something that is making me better by expanding my taste and showing me that how much more is possible in terms of simplicity and design. Couldn't imagine something so well thought, humble and respectful.",POSITIVE
"Good mobile, but sometime in display fingerprint sensor do not work properly after applying tempered glass",NEGATIVE
power adopter and headset not in the box as per sowing on Amazon,NEGATIVE
Loved the UI and OS of this phone.,POSITIVE
"Charging speed, Design, Processor",POSITIVE
"Nothing os is thrust upon theuser there is no option to select default android UI. The Nothing os ui is annoying and it is difficult to turn of some features which I can only call stupid. I.e. the wifi gets switched off often, probablywhen it cand find wifi. Again when you are back in wifi zone it doesn't turn on because it is switched off.they should have allowed switching to default android Ui. Hence 2 stars because of this I was more towards giving the 1 star",NEGATIVE
Best Phone under ₹16000.,POSITIVE
"This one is hands down best combo of firetv stick and Indian made TV. This is 2020 version (H1F1), which has 20W sound instead of old 16W sound. Picture quality is great, sound is nice. Best part, apps and firetv stick responds so quick that my old Sony smart-tv looks lost in league. First time updates and everything will take time but is easy. Remote is much better than Alexa and Mi. Also supports voice command and screen off while listening music. Tons of apps and regular firmware update. In the end, in this small city ... Onida customer care called, fixed a technician appointment and then tech came. He checked the TV for damages and wrote down the warranty card with direct call number. Chinese... Brands... Go back from India. We have a contender now.",POSITIVE
"I ordered Onida 32 inch after going through several other options available (Mi. etc) Initially, it look some time due to updates, and once done, it started working smoothly. Sound quality is fine (considering 15k price range), Picture quality is nice. This TV 'Fire TV OS', which I found only little bit lag, but manageable. Overall I can say - under 15k, this is a smart and good choice.",POSITIVE
Tv is good but remote quality is not good,NEGATIVE
With in 3 days of usgae the TV stopped working...now no power..not worth buying.,NEGATIVE
Video picture quality best lowest price best TV,NEGATIVE
"*1 day review*  Amazon delivered the product within 24 hrs. Person from ONIDA came for installation within 48 hrs as they promised. Completely satisfy with picture and sound quality. (My previous TV was 20yrs old box type tv, so i dont know picture quality of other LED or LCD tv.) Connectivity is also good. No buffering on wifi, mobile casting works fine and faced no issues while using USB pendrives.  I will also upload 6 months review.",POSITIVE
This tv is value for money. It responds really fast to the remote. The picture and sound quality are really nice. You Dont need a sound bar with it. And no such problem of internet connection getting lost. It works so smooth once connected. Overall a very nice tv to buy. I am happy that I bought it after going through all the options. A thumbs up from me.,POSITIVE
"I have bought new TV in December 2020. I am continuously facing the issue of ""Power Drain"" in my New Remote. I realized this problem a month of use after my purchase. I immediately made a complaint to Onida for replacement. It's almost 5 months, I haven't received any replacement from the company. Every time I am following with them to know about replacement and they are ensuring I will receive new remote but not giving any timeline. It's really a painful experience in the after sale service with Onida. Have a second thought about After Sale Service before buying Onida Products. Also Sound fluctuation issue (sometimes suddenly sound ups and down) and voice recognition issue with remote, was raised service request with in warranty period. Service guys (2 members) visited my place, and upgraded software and checked remote, reset the remote. and as they have suggested batteries draining issue will check after 2 days observation. Later no update and no one visited. again when I have called the support they just told me that the service request is closed and your complaint is resolved.. I have raised complaint again and now this the 10th time in past 6 months I’m raising a complaint for the same issue… let’s s see.. if this’ll not work now the for sure I’ll blow the product on fire somewhere at Onida Showroom…",NEGATIVE

"The screen is bright and does its job quite well while displaying 4k content. Speakers are of only 36wh but the output is way better for an apartment type home. Its value for money definitely acer is doing amazing in budget TV section. The processor is one con that I discovered that it can get laggy, it forcefully gets out of apps to maintain the performance but you can sometimes feel the laggyness. I'd hope acer will use better processors for next lineup of TVs. Except the processor, everything is good and the product is recommendable.",POSITIVE
"The Acer 40-inch Smart Full HD TV is an impressive addition to any home entertainment setup. With its sleek design and vibrant display, it truly elevates the viewing experience. The Full HD resolution delivers stunning clarity and color depth, making movies, sports, and games come alive with detail.

"Putting this review after almost a month of usage. Picture quality and streaming quality is good. Display colour and sound also great. But lagging in performance, bluetooth remote sometimes not working, and only works through IR mode. Surfing between apps is still a bad experience. Viewing files in the pendrive is so much difficult. Even a 720p video can't be played smoothly when it's on my pendrive, but streaming a 1080p video through ott apps still works smoother. User interface is good, adjusting screen brightness, making some changes in the settings during an app usage is better than MI TVs. On an average It's good for the pricing, but it's not promising the specifications mentioned by the company, Acer should improve these things in the upcoming updates.",NEGATIVE
The acer I pro 43 inch 4k tv has very nice picture quality. There is minor lag in settings. Other then that UI is very smooth. My only problem is with the video playback from external hard disk. The inbuilt media player keep crashing while play 4k movies. some time takes too much time to load videos from hard disk and also sometimes it got stuck while fast forwarding. The issue doesn't solve with other media player. Nova player works fine in this tv but doesn't support HDR . The MX plays can play HDR videos but keeps freezing in this. (Both player works fine with my mi box 4k). I purchased this tv hoping the newer processor in this model will be more powerful but that's not the case. Or it may be it is some optimization problem. Otherwise tha picture quality is very good while playing online videos.,NEGATIVE
"Today, I received my Acer I Pro 55-inch TV, and after watching it, I want to share my review with all of you. This review will focus on my experience with the VA panel TV.  After watching multiple reviews on YouTube, I bought this TV, but I am very disappointed with those YouTubers. While they highlighted many positive aspects of the TV, they did not properly explain the limitations of the VA panel.  Here’s the issue: VA panels lose color accuracy when viewed from angles beyond 20 degrees. These panels are excellent if you’re viewing the TV directly from the front, where they provide 100% color accuracy. However, as soon as you change your viewing angle, you will notice significant color distortion. The picture begins to fade, and if your seating position changes to 30 to 40 degrees, the colors look completely washed out, and the picture loses its vibrancy.  Based on my experience, I strongly suggest that before purchasing a large-screen TV, visit a store and compare VA panels TV with IPS panels TV, especially on SD channels, which many of us watch daily. This will help you make a more informed decision.",NEGATIVE

"It's nothing new. It's the same old generation sony panel. If you have a older 70L or 75L model, then it's exactly the same with a bit of software tweaks.  Pros: 1. Panel is vibrant. Contrast ration is okay for the price. The HDR content looks absolutely amazing. 2. It's google tv with it's usual google TV glory. Easy to use as a google TV can be. 3. Functions as intended. Can side load apps but be careful with that. 4. Have 2 HDMI ports, so if you want you can connect PS5 and a music system with HDMI/ARC. 5. Speaker is a 2 × 20W speaker. It is decently loud for a 15×10 ft room that we have. 6. I saw some reviewers calling it a 50HZ TV. It's not. It's 60Hz, so don't worry. You can do some casual gaming on it. 7. Voice controls works great.  Cons: 1. personalizing the image output is a bit hard since the settings are hidden. Also they don't give you a test image or video to set it.  2. The remote is fine. Not great. Doesn't have number pad so if you're using any D2H or cable network, you have to use their remote. So in those cases you will need to shuffle around with 2 remotes.  3. No wall mounting system in the box and the one company provides for free isn't flexible. Thisbis outrageous. Why would you not provide a flexible wall mount for free?!  4. Performance can sometimes lag in the UI.  That's all. It's a decent TV. The sony panel is great.  Few suggestion for future buyers.  Keep the picture mode in either ""game"" or ""cinema"", if you like natural colours and less bright, pleasing image output.  If you're into bright or vibrant content viewing, go with ""photo"" mode.  Stay away from every other modes, they just destroy the volour accuracy of the panel. The panels best colour reproduction is already to vibrant I'm with kore emphasis on green and blue. So don't go with other modes than these three.  If you know about tuning up image then sure do personalize it, advance options are available. But if you're novice, stick to these three modes.  Also, if you're sitting less than 5 feet away form the TV, don't enable motion flow. It will create artifacts that will be noticeable at less distance from the tv.",NEGATIVE

The TV supports HDMI 2.1 and VRR, which enhances the gaming experience.  The sound quality is also good, with clear dialogue and decent bass. However, I recommend using a separate sound system for a more immersive experience.  Overall, I'm impressed with the Sony 50-Inch 4K Smart TV.

"I recently purchased Acer 43-Inch Google TV from Amazon, and I am delighted to share my experience with this fantastic product. From its sleek design to its impressive performance, this TV has exceeded my expectations in every aspect.  First and foremost, the picture quality is truly remarkable. The 43-inch screen displays vibrant colors, deep blacks, and incredible clarity, creating an immersive viewing experience. Whether I'm watching movies, sports events, or playing video games, the visuals are stunning and lifelike. The high resolution and excellent contrast ensure that every detail is crisp and vivid.  The sound quality of this TV is equally impressive. 30W speakers with DOLBY ATMOS deliver clear and rich audio, providing an immersive sound experience. Additionally, the TV supports various sound modes and equalizer settings, allowing me to customize the audio according to my preferences. The result is a truly cinematic experience from the comfort of my living room.  Setting up the TV was a breeze. The user-friendly interface and intuitive remote control made the initial setup process quick and hassle-free. Navigating through the menu and accessing various features and apps is seamless, thanks to the smart TV functionality. I appreciate the convenience of having popular streaming services pre-installed, giving me access to a wide range of content with just a few clicks.  Connectivity options are plentiful on this TV. With multiple 3 HDMI Ports 2.1 and 2 USB ports, I can easily connect my gaming console, Blu-ray player, and other devices without any hassle. The Dual band Wi-Fi connectivity ensures smooth streaming and online content access, allowing me to explore a world of entertainment options.  Another noteworthy aspect is the TV's sleek and modern design. The slim bezels and slim profile make it a stylish addition to my living room. It blends seamlessly with the decor, and the wide viewing angles ensure a great picture from any position in the room.  Lastly, the customer service provided by the manufacturer has been exceptional. They promptly addressed my queries and provided helpful assistance, ensuring that I had a positive experience throughout. Also, this product is Made in India.  Acer 43-Inch Google TV has proven to be an excellent investment. Its impressive picture quality,DOLBY VISION, 30W immersive sound with DOLBY ATMOS, user-friendly interface, and frameless design make it a top choice for both entertainment enthusiasts and casual viewers. I highly recommend this TV to anyone in search of a high-quality, feature-rich television that delivers an exceptional viewing experience.  I am currently highly satisfied with the product. After a month of usage, I will provide further updates and insights.",POSITIVE
"I purchased this TV in last year (2023) GIF Here are my experience :  1. Sound Quality: The 30-watt speakers deliver impressive sound quality, making my viewing experience enjoyable. However, the bass could be a bit stronger to enhance the overall audio experience. 2. WiFi Connectivity: I haven't faced any issues with WiFi connectivity. The TV connects seamlessly to my network, ensuring smooth streaming of content. 3. Sturdy Stand: The stand is robust and provides excellent support for the TV. It feels secure and stable, which is reassuring. 4. Google TV UI: While the Google TV interface offers a wide range of features, it can be a bit laggy at times. Navigating through the menus isn't always as smooth as I'd like. 5. HDR Video Playback: Playing HDR videos on this TV is a delight. The picture quality is stunning, with vibrant colors (reddish sometime I noticed) and sharp details.  Important for Buyers: I recommend installing this TV in a bedroom rather than a drawing room or hall. The VA panel can cause color shifting when viewed from the sides, which not be ideal for larger spaces.  Overall, this TV offers great value for its price, with a few minor areas for improvement. If you're looking for a 4K TV with good sound and excellent HDR performance, this is a solid choice for smaller rooms.",POSITIVE
Picture quality is good. Full value of money,POSITIVE
"I am posting this review after nearly 6 months of usage. First of all the screen quality is very bad. For e.g. if you are watching a movie it will play as if you are watching a normal video which is recorded on a phone or it seems as if a documentary is shown on the screen. Despite of changing the picture mode to Cinematic mode,sports,gaming etc nothing seems to work. I have lodged several complaint with Acer regarding the same and every time they send a technician and say that this is normal since this is a 43 inch SMART TV. To this I showed them another 43 inch SMART tv (Samsung) of my neighbor and told them to see the picture quality. To this the technician replied that since we are using Airtel digital set top box this is normal and we should opt for Airtel digital HD set top box. However he didn't that the set up box i had was already an HD type and when I shown him the HD channels on my Acer TV he was dumbfounded. Then he replied that this might be a mother board issue and that he will have go remove the TV , send it to company and if they find any issue in it they will replace the motherboard and send it back to us which would take considerable no. Of days. Later on he further admitted that this issue with motherboard is very common in Acer TV and that we might have to send it to company. After this I called Acer and told them this is the issue and I want a new TV since the product is under warranty. To this they replied that they would send a SENIOR technician to sort out the issue however no one has came ever since and it has been more Than 2 months now. I purchased Acer tv thinking that since it has already established itself in CPU and monitors and that the fact it is available at a lower price than samsung I went ahead for the purchase.Howvever this purchase costed me dearly and now I am exchanging it to go for Samsung or Sony. Thus the money which I intended to save while purchasing Acer is gone entirely and I had to learn it the hard way that BRAND DOES MATTER. So it is a sincere appeal to all those interested buyers even if you are tight on budget don't go for this.",NEGATIVE
Nice performance with very good panel,POSITIVE
"The processor running Android TV is very underpowered and is laggy. Other than the navigation, picture and sound quality is great.",NEGATIVE

Good clarity and nice sound. but installation team is not professional,NEGATIVE
"Never brought this TV from Amazon. The amazon courier service was very bad. 1st time they delay the service to deliver the TV due to late delivery I cancelled the order. I order it again for 2nd time. Then 2nd issue was they didn't give the installation service. My experience for order this TV through Amazon was bad.  But TCL TV was very good 👍. The picture, sound and features are awesome. It comes with Dolby Atmos, Dolby vision, Onkoy 2.1 sound subwoofer, HDR 10. The Google applications are performing very smoothly. I recommend to all TV lover please brought this TV to experience a great picture, sound and other features of TV.",POSITIVE
Best tv in price and size,POSITIVE
"I got faulty TV, IR receiver inside TV didn’t responded. I need to raise warranty service request but they responded with worst solutions, later they assigned technicians to fix it. Technician contacted me by saying that I need to pay him 450INR to come to my home and fix it. I asked him, why i need to pay when its under warranty, but he denied saying that TV company will give them only 150INR to do the job, which will not cover my petrol costs also. Then he warned me saying that if i am interested for that price he will come to do service else leave. I contacted customer care and reported the issue with Technician, they said he should not take any money, and from their side they also escalated the issue. No reply from anyone, so i contacted technician again and said will see after the job done about money, first visit. He came and tried to do something with remote but no use. So he left that day saying he will be back again. After 2 days he came and opened TV , there we can see clearly that IR receiver cable is not connected to board. Its simply a assembly issue in manufacturing. He just clipped it, it worked. He asked for 750rs , then i asked it its under warranty right why i need to pay but he denied. Then he argued a lot and took money. Such a Worst customer care by TCL.  One more thing is that Amazon misleading or miscommunication about the product, by displaying it as OLED Tv . I thought its OLED and purchased but its not Oled tv. I got cheated by amazon",NEGATIVE
"not a qled, no mention of qled in box. pixel density is bad looks pixeleted even in 4k from close , delivery was late, charged me another 1000 rupees, which is a scam it offers a 200rs mounting kit. If you ask them to reschedule they asked me to install on my own. They will just claim the warranty and leave. Other this works fine with the tv perticularly game mode makes a good smoothing.",NEGATIVE

"I recently purchased this masterpiece. I really wasn't expecting this TV to be this good considering its price point. Until now, I had only experienced Samsung, Sony and lg TVs and was really hoping that this TV will be not much of a disappointment. But to my surprise, this TV is fantastic. Picture quality is easily at par with my 55-inch Samsung frame TV, and audio quality is at an entirely different level. Truly, there is no need of any external speaker. Android interface of this TV works without any glitch. I have connected my PS5 through HDMI, and it's a pleasure playing games on this big, gorgeous screen with theater like audio. At this price point, I am more than satisfied. Just keeping my fingers crossed that this TV works like this for a long time and hoping that the customer service is equally exceptional.",POSITIVE
This don't buy this VU TV as it's display is very low and poor quality this is pure Chinese low quality TV made by company high sense view only put their logo strip on it they don't have proper customer services I have purchased TV one and half month back initially it has a bubble.and dot on it which I initially ignore when we touch it during cleaning a line started coming and after few days liquid spread all over the TV if you want to be tension free always buy branded TV instead of this Chinese VU TV.  I felt cheated when customer care person told me that we don't cover this in warranty.,NEGATIVE

"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE

"I recently upgraded to the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV, and I’m quite impressed by what it delivers at its price point. Here’s my personal take:  Picture Quality:  The 4K resolution with Dolby Vision really stands out. Watching UHD content is a treat, with vibrant colors and clear details, especially in brighter scenes. However, when streaming SDR content or older shows, you might notice some graininess, especially on larger screens like the 65-inch model. Adjusting the backlight and saturation can help if you prefer more natural tones, as the default settings can be a bit too vivid for my taste.  Sound:  The 30W speakers are surprisingly good for regular TV viewing, supporting Dolby Audio and DTS. For everyday use, they’re loud and clear enough, but I found the bass to be lacking, so if you're a fan of deep, immersive sound, investing in a soundbar might be a good idea.  User Interface:  Google TV is easy to navigate, and I love how it suggests shows and movies across platforms based on my viewing habits. Plus, Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature is a great addition, giving access to over 200 live channels without extra subscriptions. Switching between apps is generally smooth, though I noticed slight lag after prolonged use, but it’s nothing that impacts the overall experience too much.  Design:  The sleek black design with thin bezels looks great in any room. I opted to mount mine on the wall, which I think suits the larger models better as they can take up a lot of space on a stand. It's not a premium build, but it’s sturdy and fits well with modern interiors.  Smoothness In terms of smoothness, the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV is decent but not flawless. The TV is powered by a quad-core A55 chipset, paired with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. For regular tasks like switching between apps, browsing, and streaming, the performance is generally smooth. However, some users have reported occasional lag, especially after prolonged use or when loading heavier apps. It's not a dealbreaker, but the experience might not be as snappy as higher-end models.  The Google TV interface is a big plus here, as it runs efficiently, with intuitive navigation and quick access to content across various platforms. Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature adds to the smoothness, with seamless integration of live TV and streaming apps into one unified experience.  For basic daily use, the smoothness is acceptable, but if you’re after a flawless, zero-lag experience, you might notice occasional slowdowns with heavy multitasking.  Final Thoughts:  Overall, the Xiaomi X Series delivers excellent value for anyone seeking a 4K TV with smart features at an affordable price. Its picture quality shines with UHD content, and the Google TV integration is intuitive. Just be prepared for some occasional performance hiccups and consider adding external speakers if audio quality is a priority for you.",POSITIVE
"Very good and colourful panel, deep blacks, moderate viewing angles. Metal back feels solid. Speaker is also lound and clear. One con is that TV sometimes get slow and ui frames caps to like 30 hz, but it is rare. Hope this issue gets solved by update. Overall if anyone wants fabulous picture quality this should be a very good option. I got the tv at 21750 during sale, so it is value for money product",POSITIVE
"I bought it in August 2024 the packaging was good damage on executive delivered the product at my doorstep and the check the product whether it was damage or not then after 2 hours MI service centre technician called me for installation and they reach to my home within 1 hour and installed the product but I have to pay it extra 500 rupees for the Wall mount because the Wall mount was not including in the box but that is okay because the Wall mount brand is also MI, functionality of the product is good picture quality is good enough features of the product is good but the space of internal storage is not enough(only 8gb,free space is about 4gb)it should be 16GB or more for internal memory, installation was very quick and we are using the TV for last 2 month for me it's a good product I got it from Amazon at rupees of 20700 and extra 500 I paid for the Wall mount so basically it was a good deal but after that the TV was sold in great Indian festival at rupees of 17700 so I missed the opportunity to buy the product at a low price of that never mind, the product connectivity is good, picture quality was very good just go for it",NEGATIVE
As i purchase this Mi A Pro tv because of new launch and affordable price. As i can see some lag in OS as well as playing any 4k content and the internet speed was slow as i connected it through Hotspot...it was taking some time to load even though my internet speed was 300mbps and the delivery guys carelessly kept this Tv flat in their vehicle but tnx there was no damage rather then everything is good worth buying and i hope they fix some bugs in next update Quick Pros* Excellent Picture Quality Excellent Sound Build quality is good Affordable Price Worth buying  Cons* ( which i faced ) Little lag in OS & 4k content Response time is little slow Stand build quality is not good,NEGATIVE
"The worst ever sound quality. Good display but with performance lag! After a week, sound became weaker than it was in the beginning! No more option to replace the TV or replace with another brand!!",NEGATIVE
We are asking this tv for last 6 months now. Haven’t faced any issues till now. Everything works fine. Picture quality is also good. Also our expectations were not great in terms of picture quality so it’s a good match for us. The Bluetooth is good. However there is one drawback in terms of asking pens drives and video formats. I would like to ask the makers which video format is supported by this brand. Its would be great if these instructions are also provided on box or tv for easy use. You much have species it in user manual but anyone hardly reads. Overall it’s a good buy for me.,POSITIVE

"The TV is good over all. TV picture quality: decent! Sound: average User interface: good The drawbacks are that since it's a Linux OS it does not connect to 5g Internet service and does not support Netflix app or any other mostly popular apps that will be pretty soon popular. So 1 needs to use a Fire TV stick to view Netflix amd other apps on this TV. 2. Also while using Fire Tv stick in this TV, 1 needs to use 2 remotes. Fire Tv stick remote to operate and navigate through apps and controls but the TV remote just for volume control!",NEGATIVE
"""Horrible Experience with VW 32-Inch LED TV""  I regret buying the VW 32-inch LED TV. At first, it seemed like a decent budget option, but it turned out to be a complete waste of money. After just two months of light use, the remote stopped working entirely. I replaced the batteries, reset the TV, and even tried universal remotes—nothing worked!  The customer service is even worse. Reaching them is like solving a puzzle, and when you finally get through, they’re unhelpful and dismissive. They suggested I buy a new remote at my own cost and price us 1200/- ! Why should I pay extra for their faulty product?  To make matters worse, the TV itself is slow and unresponsive when you try to operate it manually. The picture quality is mediocre at best, and the sound is tinny. This product has been nothing but frustration.  Save yourself and avoid this brand altogether. It’s not worth it!",NEGATIVE
"*Non-Biased review, read full and make your decision*  Size ordered: 43 Inches Price for which I bought: 23,262(Credit Card Discount Included) (For fitting of TV you have to contact LG by yourself, the installation is free you have to show the amazon invoice)  In-Box: TV, HDMI Cable, Stand Legs, Screws and Some Paper Work  Pros: - Really premium finish and build quality - Smooth UI - Best picture quality and colors under 30-35K range(Trust me) - Really good speakers - A reliable and good performing processor  Cons: - Not mentioned whether IPS or VA(my unit is IPS I guess) - Nothing else, everything worked fine for me (Will update if I find some issues in future)  Review: So the room where the TV is fitted is a living room, not too big not too small. The first impressions of TV were outstanding I mean the price that you are paying for the TV is clearly justified. Upgrading from smaller 32 inches TV the upgrade was kinda huge for me and I was stunned to see the 4K picture quality for first time.  Earlier I had a Sony Bravia TV and according to me sony gives the best picture quality a TV can give, but LG changed my mind. In just a few years the quality has improved drastically. The blacks are really good even in an IPS panel. Again I am not sure what panel it is, it's just and estimate.  The speakers are clearly more than enough for me. Like on full volume my floor sorts of vibrate, and I don't even have to bother about a sound bar anymore.  The SD channels, the quality they provide are really surprising. The upscaling has improved a lot and I can say you can enjoy SD channels on this TV too. And for HD channels, I don't have much to say but ""AMAZING"".  Earlier I was leaning towards other 43 inches TV's of Hisense and Acer, but spending some extra money to get LG was totally worth it. Other alternatives: Samsung Crystal 4k Series but I prefer LG after it's performance.  Totally recommend, you can buy this product.",POSITIVE
"It’s a nice big screen tv, this one is 55”, looks sturdy and well built, good quality full HD images and supports Dolby 5.1, good pixel ratio as well and was very easy to get wall mounted! The only cons I’d say is that it comes with a moveable adjustable wall mount stand, but it’s a little too tight and difficult to move front and back, but is easy when moved sideways; and the response time sometimes is usually slow for certain actions. Unique remote, if you want the remote seen in the above video then you gotta select the magic remote option while selecting the variant. The TV can also be controlled entirely through your phone via the LG ThinQ app, has all Options exactly like it’s remote. Worth the price, got it at a deal.",POSITIVE
"Just purchased this bad boy and I couldn't be happier! The picture quality is stunning, with realistic to vibrant colors that make every scene immersive.  AUDIO- • The sound is immersive and comes with different modes to focus on dialogues or cinematic sound, delivering clear and loud audio that fills the room. I just need 45-50 % audio to hear each element clearly.  FEATURE • Navigating through the smart features is a breeze, thanks to the magic remote ( which I paid extra 2400rs for the installation guy). Although this caused the tv to run fast which causes lag sometimes. Magic remote also gives you additional features which is not possible with the simple remote.  DISPLAY- •The colours are close to realistic . And you can select how you want to view what you're watching with different colour modes. There's also a gaming mode for play station ( I don't own one yet so I'm going to add the review when I'm purchasing it  Overall, this TV offers fantastic value for its price. I purchased this for 26K (The one which I purchased is 43 inches and I got the Wall mount for free which was worth 500rs )",POSITIVE
"Overall a value product (75 inch) with very good quality. Happy with the sound and screen brightness. Design could have been sleeker, yet Google TV makes it worth it",POSITIVE
Writing this review after 15 days of use I got the 55inch C61b for rs 31739 effective without no cost emi discount. For that price its a steal deal!! Pros: Sound - the 35w onkyo speaker system on this tv is beast. You won’t need a soundbar if your room is below 150 sqft. The bass is good. The sound clarity is superb. No distortion even in higher volumes. Best speaker system that I have seen in a tv. Picture- its a VA qled panel The picture quality is very good Blacks are deep Colours are punchy No complaints with picture fully satisfied The google tv os is very responsive with minor lags only after booting which goes away after sometimes. Dolby vision HDR HLG HDR10+ supports are there You need to adjust few settings to avoid motion smoothening issue Gaming mode is also there  Cons The con I felt is the little backlight bleeding on edges which you won’t notice normally But visible in grey screens not in black So not a big issue Installation is very late I got call after 8th day for installation  Overall this is the best tv you can buy under 40k Go for 55 inch or above the onkyo sound is superb Will definitely recommend,POSITIVE
TCL is very good picture quality with affordable price for this QLED TV and very nice audio experience. This TV is equal of samsung and sony and LG TV picture quality.  Worth product,POSITIVE
"Its a review of the 55 inch tv!!! PROS: 1. Design: With minimum bezels, its an updated design, feels premium by the sleek edges. 2. Display: The TV supports DOLBY vision, 4k with QLED. If you are upgrading from an HD tv, you are going to be blown away by the colour output it generates. The colour contrast with deep blacks is quite amazing. I personally haven't tried game mode so cannot comment. I have tried connecting my gaming laptop in HDMI, played FC24, it feels good by the amazing 55 inches display. The tv is quite bright even in sunny daylight. Viewing angle is also good. 3. Sound: The TV comes with a 20W speaker in the back, has a good bass and is quite loud. If you are music enthusiast, you won't be impressed. Its loud and clear and satisfactory when compared to other tv's in the market. No distortion even at 100% volume. 4. Connectivity: Wifi connectivity is good. I use my 5G phone for internet connection with unlimited pack. No lagging issues at all and its a GOOGLE TV so you get maximum app support. CONS: 1. Display: If you are a sports lover, you would be disappointed. The tv has jittering issues and motion clarity isn't good when it comes to sports. High action scenes with fast movement is where the tv lags. When watching cricket, the motion clarity isn't good enough. FINAL VERDICT: I bought this 55 inch tv for 34k. In this price point, you surely won't be disappointed at all. Its the best OLED TV you can find in the market. Trust me, even SAMSUNG, LG and SONY fails when compared with price. I personally visited Relaince Digital before buying the TV online. I compared all the TV's and bought this after thorough research. Buy this tv and you wouldn't regret at all. The only CON isn't a deal breaker at all. I love watching cricket and its ok with the jittering. I am pretty satisfied with the overall experience. I recommend buying the 4k pack of OTT's like Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime. You would love the overall viewing experience of watching movies and series in this huge display.",POSITIVE
I rarely give a 5 star .. It got amazing picture quality and decent soundd quality... The tv runs pretty fast and the blacks are so deep... Good upscaling... Best under 40k for 43inches tv,POSITIVE
Product is good but installation guys were in hurry..as they are service provider also hence not raised any complaint..,NEGATIVE
After using 3 weeks i must say I chosen the best 4K TV with the price best sound best picture quality best configuration best product best 4K best colours on the TV,POSITIVE
"I bought this TV for watching in my home. I like the build and the sleek design. One Important matter I want to bring to your notice is that communication within Amazon to its customers are leaking out....... After delivery, I was informed by Amazon that the technician will come the next day (Sunday) who didn't turn up. After that, I got another intimation from Amazon stating that a new technician will come the NEXT day for installation. He did. However, in between I got an anonymous call from UK stating that they are calling from Amazon and informed me of the technician's visit and asked me to confirm by pressing 1 or 9 to cancel.....!!!! I ignored the call. This is just for your information to take up matter within so as to plug any loophole in your communication leakage.",NEGATIVE
"I haven't used an android/google TV before. If you're already a heavy youtube user, the TV is for you. The picture quality is great despite its price, it delivers great value for your money. This TV is a price - performance monster, I can honestly say.",POSITIVE
"TV was okay initially but started running slowly after a couple months. The menu scrolling lags so much and TV restarts evertime I start apps like netflix. I have kept the software up to date and done all sorts of trouble shooting with no fix. Picture and sound quality are excellent but TV is so laggy and unpredictable. I would have returned it, but window is closed.",NEGATIVE
"Our old LG tv was past it's best and with strong sunlight the picture was very dark. We looked at TCL and Hisense in Currys but they didn't really seem interested in selling us one and were trying to push expensive Samsung's onto us. We didn't want to spend that much so retired to Costa for a coffee. Whilst there I looked on Amazon and noticed the price of the 50"" TCL had dropped to £299 so went for it, the Currys price was £374 at the time.  So far it has been very good with excellent picture quality, however this is an Android tv and setting it up was a pain with not much help from the manual. Altogether it took two days messing around to get a decent setup! Android is a mobile phone operating system owned by Google, so they really push you to either log in to your Google account or set one up. I'm not the greatest fan of Google because it wants to know too much of your business but there are a few videos on YouTube (also owned by Google!) about setting it up as a standalone. On all my old tv's you scan for channels and it works, not any more so beware.  Once I'd scanned all the channels in (nearly 1000!) the picture went to a ""Home screen"" and I hadn't got a clue what to do next. Eventually by a matter of trial and error and just pushing buttons on the remote I got onto a channel list and got Freeview to work, please note there is no built in Freesat on this as there was on our old LG. The channels were all over the place with BBC at about channel 45. Lots of channels didn't work with a message saying some dongle or other wasn't installed and to be honest I was not very impressed at the end of day 1.  On day 2 I decided to re-scan the channels and noticed a few options so opted for ""Free only"". This made a big difference and the ""dongle"" channels had disappeared. The channels were all still mixed up and then I noticed the channel list was in alphabetical order, so ITV was way down the list. This was getting more and more frustrating by the minute until I found a channel organizer in the settings. This brings up the channel list again but using the remote it's possible to click on a channel which brings an option box up. One of the options is ""Move"", by clicking on this option then clicking on another channel number the first channel moves to the new position. So I was able to move BBC1 to channel 1 and then spent the next few hours moving dozens of other channels as well. There is a ""Favourites"" option but I still haven't worked that one out yet.  Is it a good tv? I would say yes but be prepared for a lot of faffing about unless you are a wizz kid geek. I still haven't worked it all out but have got it so it's watchable but even now after a few weeks I still get confused by it, mainly trying to get from the home screen onto normal channels.",NEGATIVE
Superb value great picture quality easy set up migration,POSITIVE
"I received the TV brand new, after i removed the tape, i saw that there are two huge dots where the pixels are dead.",NEGATIVE
Mi tv is good and nice quality. I have been using 43 inch mi 4k tv since 2021 and now again buy another mi tv. Value for money. Display quality is nice.,POSITIVE
"I'm using this tv in last 2 months....there is no issues, good sound quality, good build quality, clear display, no lagging, always watching movies in prime and hot star without lagging....some peoples told in reviews like there is a big bassils not like the tv picture from the app......it's depends on your video aspect ratio no tv fault My opinion is worth for money",NEGATIVE
"LG, Samsung, and Sony were, for 6-7 years, the only brands to dominate the television market.  In today’s era, what I feel is that brands of television that come under 20k–22k (I am talking about a 40- or 43-inch TV), brands like Xiaomi-Redmi-MI, TCL, Thomson, Oneplus, Haier, Iffalcon, etc., or any other Chinese or French-assembled brands in India have all the same panels.  The price we pay while choosing from one of these brands is for the brand name alone, or what’s the current position the brand is holding in the market. For example, Xiamoi and Oneplus hold good brand value, so their televisions' prices lie between 18 and 22k for a 40 or 43inch.  On the other hand, brands like TCL and Thomson are working hard on establishing their brand to get ahead of Xiaomi and Oneplus. That’s why their products’ price for the same 40-42 inch is between 15000 and 21,000.  All I want to say is that if you want the best picture quality, Android/Google UI/UX experience, and speed in your TV, then I would definitely say to push your budget 4x upwards and obviously go for the oldest television dominators in the market (what we call the Sada Bahar product), i.e., Sony, LG, and Samsung. Which price will start at 27k and go up to 40k.  Or  If your purpose is to watch DTH, HD channels only, want good picture quality, and a smooth Android/Google UI/UX experience does not matter to you that much, then you can definitely go for any brand that is selling TVs under 22K.  You can buy any of the brands, either Xiamoi or Thomson TV, because they use the same panels, the back body build quality is the same, there might be minute things here and there, but all over the experience and the quality are the same. They are all assembled; just the brand name is changed, and you are paying 2-3k more for that brand name only.  Now, you’ll say, ""After-sale service also matters, and it differs brand to brand.” Yes, I absolutely agree with you on that. But tell me one thing: in almost all these brands, you are getting a 1 or 2 year warranty. Right? So, if you purchase online, you get all the facilities, the toll-free number, the brand’s customer care details, etc., and if any problem occurs, then with such an established system, these brands are selling appliances across the globe, so these brands, if some problem occurs, will definitely respond and will the service you want, whether it’s Thomson or Xiaomi.  So, in after-sale service too, these brands are all the same. With the brands Sony, Samsung, and LG, it is all about reliability, credibility, supreme quality, and overall experience.   All in all, I am satisfied with my purchase; it is a good TV. But when it came, I was going through the details of the Thomson TV. The reviews were all good, and I felt that 19000 ka Xiaomi ki jaghe Thomson ka same 40-inch 15000 vala le leta. Because saab kuch from display to features same hi toh hai, sirf brand name ka farak hai. But anyways, jo kharidliya voh badhiya, aab kya sochna.  If you are planning to purchase a 40- to 43-inch TV below 20k–22k, then go with any of the brands, from TCL to Xiaomi to Oneplus to Thomson. Only if a brand name written on the TV’s bottom does not matter to you; just the TV matters!!!  Peace!!!",NEGATIVE
"TV stopped working within 1 month after purchase. after raising the complaint(TVIN2404210000143) on 21/4/24 technician visited my place and told me that the problem was with the cable provider and closed the complaint. but when I checked with cable providers I came to know that the problem was With the TV itself.  As already complaint has already closed I had to raise a new complaint (TVIN2404270002095) on 27/4/24. this time the technician visited my place and told me that there was a problem with the motherboard and to replace that board I had to wait for another week. but the problem was not solved. TV was not working Even after installing the New motherboard. this time the technician told me There was a problem with the display panel and it had to be replaced. and he will inform service providers regarding this.  After this, I waited for a few days but I didn't get any update from the service providers. so I called customer care and I got to know that my complaint had been closed without any resolution. and they didn't contact me regarding this.  After this, I raised the complaint (TVIN 2405110000356) on 11/5/24 for the replacement of the display panel as suggested by the technician. he visited my place with the new display panel on 22/5/24. and while installing that display I could see sparks and smoke all over the TV. And he couldn't able to install it as the entire TV was defective. and he informed us that the TV isn't in reparable condition and it will be replaced.  But on 23/5/24 I checked in the Xiaomi app about the status of the complaint and I could see in the Xiaomi app that the complaint had been closed without any resolution. and on the same day, I got a call from one more technician saying that he would take the defective TV back.. and he will check whether it was repairable or not. and he is saying it will not be replaced. And on 25/5/24 your technician took the TV from home and asked us to wait again for 7 working days.  After waiting for 1 week, a service centre person came with a TV on 1/6/24. Still, the TV was not working properly. I could see a complete reddish and blurry display. The technician said the service centre person would come on 3/6/24 and they would do the repair and he left. But as usual, no one appeared on 3/6/24. So I called the service centre and they are ready with an answer that they sent some mail to the product head regarding this and I have to wait for another 48 hrs. And the waiting game continues...  After going through all this drama and talking to the Xiaomi customer care and service centre, am certain that it's my fault that I bought Xiaomi's product.  And I already waited for 1 month and 16 days (46days) for it to be repaired. but it didn't happen. I hardly used it for 1 month. They took 46 days to repair it and still, they couldn't do it. The customer service executives ask you to call the service centre as they don't have proper details about the complaint. If you call the service centre they will speak as if they are doing any favour to you.  This is how Xiaomi provides after-sales service. Please think twice before you buy Xiaomi products. They provide very pathetic after-sale service.",NEGATIVE
Very Good picture quality and sound in a very low price. Enjoying Netflix and Hotstar and all other apps supported. Strongly recommend.,POSITIVE
Picture quality is good . Sound is awsm... Good tv .but one issue is I think it lagging when operate by remote.and company don't provide voice assistant remote.,NEGATIVE

"Value For Money, Picture Clarity & Sound Quality Is Really Really Awesome Really I Liked This Product Quality Of Product is No.1 Installation Is Also Very Simple Size & Design Altimate.",POSITIVE
"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE

"VU televisions are well-regarded for offering value for money with a mix of good picture quality, modern features, and competitive pricing. Here’s a detailed review:  Pros:  1. Picture Quality: VU TVs typically offer sharp, vibrant displays with good color reproduction, especially in their 4K and QLED models. 2. Affordable Pricing: They provide features comparable to premium brands like Samsung or LG at a fraction of the cost. 3.

They carefully mounted the TV, ensuring it was perfectly aligned and securely fixed. They also helped conceal the wires neatly, leaving everything looking clean and organized.

"I recently purchased the Acer V Pro 32-inch TV, and overall, I'm extremely satisfied with its performance. The picture quality is crisp and clear, the sound is impressive, and the smart TV features are seamless.  However, I've encountered one major issue - the Chromecast feature is not working. Despite multiple attempts to troubleshoot, I've been unable to get it to work. This is a significant drawback, as I was looking forward to casting content from my phone to the TV.  Aside from this issue, the TV has exceeded my expectations. The design is sleek, the interface is user-friendly, and the price is unbeatable.  If Acer can resolve the Chromecast issue, I'd gladly give this TV a 5-star rating. Until then, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great smart TV, but with the caveat that Chromecast may not work.  Pros:  - Excellent picture quality - Impressive sound - Seamless smart TV features - Sleek design - Affordable price  Cons:  - Chromecast feature not working",NEGATIVE
"The Acer V Pro Series 32-inch QLED HD Ready Smart Google TV is a great budget-friendly option with impressive features. Its QLED display delivers vibrant colors and sharp visuals, while the 30W Dolby Audio system provides clear, immersive sound. Powered by Google TV with Android 14, it offers a smooth interface and access to a wide range of apps.",POSITIVE
"Do not fall for the stamping of the word ""QLED"" or the ""4 years Warranty"", as it doesn't have any characteristics or quality of a QLED and anyhow that warranty of 4 years can only replace a defective product, but not improve an inferior product.  At first the TV would appear very compelling right upon installation and when the room is light up. But as you use it more often and watch different types of content on different OTT apps and under different lighting conditions, you'll come to realise how inferior this TV is .  Here's what my observations are after 72 hours of thorough usage:  1. YouTube app is unusable. Whenever you play an HDR 4K video, there is some popping and cracking sound ( like pat-pat-pat) coming from the speakers, whether the volume is at 20% or 80% or full . I have reset the TV thrice and restart it each time this popping sound comes, but barely 10 minutes after a restart/reset the sound starts coming again. Check the uploaded video.  2. The Panel is a really low quality one. Blacks seem to be non existent. The screen appears to be greyish with dark patches on the screen. Photo uploaded.  3. There is notable heavy vertical banding on bluish tint pictures. Observe the thick greenish pixelated and vertical bands on the Hotstar app's menu in the photo uploaded.  4. MEMC does nothing. In fast moving scenes there is heavy blurring around moving objects. For reference - watch the tiger fight scene in movie RRR. Moreover it's a headache watching a cricket match. The ball appears blurry and the follow through of batsmen is so choppy.  5. If you use the TV for more than 30 minutes with a couple of app switching in between, the UI starts lagging. (a)You press Netflix hotkey and it takes 10 seconds to open . (b)You tap on the volume up key, the volume bar starts increasing volume rapidly and then immediately starts decreasing on its own. (c) Moreover the menu selection bar gets cropped and stuck. A portion of the bar gets stuck on the menu page and the remaining bar continues to scroll. Photo attached .  6. Either it's a bug or the TV has no volume memory feature. Everytime you switch off the TV from the mains and turn it back on, the volume goes to 100%. You'll be startled by the blasting sound when you accidentally play anything without realising the volume is at 100%.  7. The Bluetooth Connectivity is really bad on this TV. I like to connect my Bluetooth TWS at night time so that next room family member doesn't get disturbed by the sound/music. But the sound is very choppy over Bluetooth and with the slightest of head movement, the Bluetooth connection between the TV and TWS starts to break and sound gets distorted. I use Samsung Buds PRO and they work well without any issues at 30 feet distance from my phone. So there's definitely something wrong with the Bluetooth of the TV as the Bluetooth remote of the TV also has lag and response issues.  My Advice after learning from this purchase the hard way:  1. Rather than buying an entry level QLED at 30K , go for a premium LED at that price point .  2. Never be the first to try out a budget version of a high end product category (QLED) from a tier 2 or tier 3 brand.  3. There is no possible way to make and sell a QLED at half the price of reputed brands. If a brand is selling such a product at half the price, then accept the fact that there is going to be a major compromise on Screen quality, Processor, Imaging & Graphics engine.",NEGATIVE
"Product is very good. Picture Quality is Very Good & Sound Quality is really Great! Even in very high volume, sound doesn't crack & there is good ""Bass"" & also crisp ""Treble"" in sound. There are extensive controls for Picture(like Backlight, Brightness, Contrast, Colour, Gamma...) & Sound(like Eualizer). Definitely recommended to anyone looking for high quality at a reasonable price!",POSITIVE

You need remote cover to hold it for long I will write more as I experience more features",POSITIVE
"Very good product. Accurate and punchy colours, Good sound quality in the native speaker. Vu is the only mainstream company providing option for 3yr warranty for their TV.",POSITIVE
"VU televisions are well-regarded for offering value for money with a mix of good picture quality, modern features, and competitive pricing. Here’s a detailed review:  Pros:  1. Picture Quality: VU TVs typically offer sharp, vibrant displays with good color reproduction, especially in their 4K and QLED models. 2. Affordable Pricing: They provide features comparable to premium brands like Samsung or LG at a fraction of the cost. 3. Variety: VU offers a wide range of TVs, from basic LED models to high-end QLEDs with Dolby Vision and HDR10 support. 4.

"*Non-Biased review, read full and make your decision*  Size ordered: 43 Inches Price for which I bought: 23,262(Credit Card Discount Included) (For fitting of TV you have to contact LG by yourself, the installation is free you have to show the amazon invoice)  In-Box: TV, HDMI Cable, Stand Legs, Screws and Some Paper Work  Pros: - Really premium finish and build quality - Smooth UI - Best picture quality and colors under 30-35K range(Trust me) - Really good speakers - A reliable and good performing processor  Cons: - Not mentioned whether IPS or VA(my unit is IPS I guess) - Nothing else, everything worked fine for me (Will update if I find some issues in future)  Review: So the room where the TV is fitted is a living room, not too big not too small. The first impressions of TV were outstanding I mean the price that you are paying for the TV is clearly justified. Upgrading from smaller 32 inches TV the upgrade was kinda huge for me and I was stunned to see the 4K picture quality for first time.  Earlier I had a Sony Bravia TV and according to me sony gives the best picture quality a TV can give, but LG changed my mind. In just a few years the quality has improved drastically. The blacks are really good even in an IPS panel. Again I am not sure what panel it is, it's just and estimate.  The speakers are clearly more than enough for me. Like on full volume my floor sorts of vibrate, and I don't even have to bother about a sound bar anymore.  The SD channels, the quality they provide are really surprising. The upscaling has improved a lot and I can say you can enjoy SD channels on this TV too. And for HD channels, I don't have much to say but ""AMAZING"".  Earlier I was leaning towards other 43 inches TV's of Hisense and Acer, but spending some extra money to get LG was totally worth it. Other alternatives: Samsung Crystal 4k Series but I prefer LG after it's performance.  Totally recommend, you can buy this product.",POSITIVE
"It’s a nice big screen tv, this one is 55”, looks sturdy and well built, good quality full HD images and supports Dolby 5.1, good pixel ratio as well and was very easy to get wall mounted! The only cons I’d say is that it comes with a moveable adjustable wall mount stand, but it’s a little too tight and difficult to move front and back, but is easy when moved sideways; and the response time sometimes is usually slow for certain actions. Unique remote, if you want the remote seen in the above video then you gotta select the magic remote option while selecting the variant. The TV can also be controlled entirely through your phone via the LG ThinQ app, has all Options exactly like it’s remote. Worth the price, got it at a deal.",POSITIVE
"Just purchased this bad boy and I couldn't be happier! The picture quality is stunning, with realistic to vibrant colors that make every scene immersive.  AUDIO- • The sound is immersive and comes with different modes to focus on dialogues or cinematic sound, delivering clear and loud audio that fills the room. I just need 45-50 % audio to hear each element clearly.  FEATURE • Navigating through the smart features is a breeze, thanks to the magic remote ( which I paid extra 2400rs for the installation guy). Although this caused the tv to run fast which causes lag sometimes. Magic remote also gives you additional features which is not possible with the simple remote.  DISPLAY- •The colours are close to realistic . And you can select how you want to view what you're watching with different colour modes. There's also a gaming mode for play station ( I don't own one yet so I'm going to add the review when I'm purchasing it  Overall, this TV offers fantastic value for its price. I purchased this for 26K (The one which I purchased is 43 inches and I got the Wall mount for free which was worth 500rs )",POSITIVE
"Value For Money, Picture Clarity & Sound Quality Is Really Really Awesome Really I Liked This Product Quality Of Product is No.1 Installation Is Also Very Simple Size & Design Altimate.",POSITIVE
"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE
Samsung products are good. Installation service is also good. Performance and display quality is very best. Really value for money. I bought this with the brand name.,POSITIVE
"Background : I was in search for a good but not pricey TV because of the following  1. My Samsung 49"" K6300 Curved TV had gone kaput in 4-5 years (DOP - Somewhere in 2017 - early 2018) 2. I was dragging my old TV with ever growing shadows accompanied with visibility issues. 3. K6300 was an eye pleasure when in good condition with amazing blacks and motion smoothness - beautiful out of the box colors.  Since a Tier 1 brand like Samsung had betrayed the trust after paying a premium , I was in the lookout of a mid range TV with up-to-date features - my check list included the following  1. Solid warranty clause with no Money extorsion policies like LG OLED post 1 year end. 2. Good sound system - Preferably with a sub-woofer. 3. Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.  I think I am tending to increase ratings from 4 to 5 stars. Just for the REGZA Pic & Sound from Toshiba.  Good and durable Japanese brands Like Sanyo, Toshiba, Panasonic ( that bring in proprietary tech) should be endorsed (even thought they may be manufactured locally under strategic partnerships) by the Indians else everything is gonna be PRC/Korea Inspired.",POSITIVE
"Initially I want to buy infinix qled t.v because of earlier experience with the brand was good moreover it was 8000 Rs economical to Toshiba but I switch over to Toshiba because of brand reputation most of the well-known brands like infinix,Motorola,Kodak,Blaupunkt, Thomson etc. used to market third party manufacturers product though I am not certain Toshiba manufacturer this t.v or it is also playing the same game but I take a bet because of goodwill and three years of warranty which no other brand is providing.I have been using the t.v for three months I have following observations about this t.v- 1-Picture quality is great (Good contrast,Punchy colours, Wide colour gamut,No screen bleeding issues,Deeper black level) can be good or at par with brands like Samsung,LG, Panasonic inferior to Sony) so there is no comparison with other brands they will fall short. 2- Toshiba's proprietary Regza chip is damm fast as well as do best upscaling moreover it's own ui makes it fast in comparison to android t.v's present in the market don't compare it's ram and rom because it can do it's work swiftly in comparision with brands having double ram and rom nodoubt because of rom storage can be issue for some. 3- Sound quality is great to me it varies person to person vocals are clear and crisp, lacking bass and surround experience is great.sound is pleasing in most of scenarios like 4k movies, webseries,games,news, loudness is sufficient for room 12×15 size of room is at par with Samsung and LG t.v's of this size. 4- settings menu is easily operable, build quality is good,great aesthetics with well built functional remote. Can be improved -. 1- Bass 2-behaves like va panel so viewing angles are not that great but not that much colour shift is seen. After one month see my video review of this t.v on my YouTube channel shobhits exact evaluation .",POSITIVE
"I've had this TV now for near 4 months. The positives are that the build quality, picture quality & sound quality are all great. The only two negatives are the OS & the lack of Filmmaker mode. So I recommend getting a FireTV device or a similar device to remedy the OS issue; the lack of Filmmaker mode means you will need to manually adjust the picture quality to give you the best viewing experience possible. Having said this the TV is still a very good buy at the price.",POSITIVE

"I recently purchased a Kodak TV, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance and value for money. The picture quality is truly exceptional, delivering vibrant colors and crisp details that enhance the viewing experience. The sound output is clear and immersive, making it perfect for watching movies and enjoying music.  The user interface is intuitive and responsive, offering easy access to a variety of apps and streaming platforms. I also appreciate the sturdy build and sleek design, which seamlessly blends into my living room decor.  What stands out the most is the affordable price point without compromising on quality or features. Overall, Kodak has done an excellent job creating a TV that caters to all entertainment needs. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE

"I purchased the Kodak TV last year, and it has been a great addition to my home. The picture quality is sharp and vibrant, perfect for daily viewing and streaming. The smart features are user-friendly, The sound is decent, though I added a soundbar for a better experience. For the price, it offers excellent value, and the build quality is sturdy. While it may not match high-end brands, it’s perfect for casual use. Overall, I’m very satisfied with my Kodak TV—it’s reliable, affordable, and delivers great performance.",POSITIVE
Good quality picture nice,POSITIVE
"The Kodak TV 32-inch offers decent picture quality and sound for its price, making it a good choice for budget-conscious buyers. Its compact size is ideal for smaller rooms or secondary spaces. However, the build quality and smart features might feel limited compared to premium brands. Overall, it's a value-for-money option for basic viewing needs.",POSITIVE
I was looking for a budget friendly as well as quality TV for my hall. This worked perfect. It's been close to an year without any issues. Perfect product for my need.,POSITIVE

"I recently bought the Sony BRAVIA 3 55-inch TV, and the picture quality is vibrant with smooth motion, perfect for sports and action movies. The sound is clear, making it a fantastic TV that exceeds expectations.",POSITIVE
"My gripe is with "" Dawntech Electronics "", the seller. Have sent 1 enquiry and 4 reminders but no reply / answer. Fedup, took my chances and placed order. Fortunately, nothing outward happened. Consider myself lucky. Had the seller replied and clarified my question, the experience would have been very pleasant. I request Amazon to take action against this seller as well similar ones who do not answer to customer's queries. They bring bad image to Amazon platform as well to the brand / item they are selling.  As for the TV, it is beautiful and classy. Great picture and surprisingly, great sound too. A sound bar can be easily avoided. Wish the TV had bigger size of 65"".",NEGATIVE
Up to expectations..... picture quality and sound also... prompt delivery.....and installation.,POSITIVE
"I wish I could give this TV a 0-star rating! I had high expectations for the LG OLED B2 55-inch TV, but the entire experience has been a nightmare. The TV arrived with a completely shattered panel—unbelievable for such an expensive product. The box looked fine, so I can’t even blame shipping. It must have left the factory like this, which tells you all you need to know about LG’s quality control.  To make matters worse, I had to exchange this broken disaster for a fully functioning TV (from another brand, thank goodness), wasting time and effort. LG’s customer service was painfully slow, and it took ages to process the replacement.  Do yourself a favor: avoid this model and save yourself the stress and frustration. LG has clearly dropped the ball on quality and service. Never again!",NEGATIVE
Table stand for TV was not there in the box and promotional OTT offers were not provided as displayed in the product description before purchasing.,NEGATIVE
"The tv is amazing, a rotating wall mount is provided as free by company, the installation took time so had to directly call LG, as Amazon was late.  The overall TV display, remote, UI is good, sound is not that good, so soundbar is required",NEGATIVE
"I purchased it ₹77000 at Ganesh Chaturthi sale with all bank & card & brand offers combined.unfortunately it was last piece of 45 inch. Can be easily fir & installed in your small bedroom. For larger screen sizes, you must place them in dining or drawing or bigger living room. The stand comes with the box and of good quality",POSITIVE
"Purchased this after a bit of confusion between this and the C3 - went for the A3 since I won't be using it for gaming (so I wasn't expecting the FPS to be a pain point). Glad that I did !  Ended up costing me 69k using the ICICI Amazon Pay card during the Prime Day sale, which I think makes it great value for money.  Some users have expressed concerns about the brightness (since A3 does not belong to the evo series) but I did not find this lacking in any way. We use it in bright as well as dim environments and there seems to be no problem with the picture brightness and the clarity at all.  All in all, an excellent purchase made more delightful by the Prime Day offer.  LG reached out proactively and sent someone for the installation, which was a breeze.",POSITIVE
"You will enjoy the Oled screen experience. Perfect black and colours. Sound quality is great, however, if required, one can buy one soundbar. But I feel its not really required. Installation was quick and smooth. 120hz native refresh rate is really great and you can see it clearly. The screen thickness is less than that of a 5 rupees indian coin. Awesome product.",POSITIVE
Nice tv picture quality is super this products are value for money,POSITIVE
"Good Sharp picture , easy setup for smart TV , sound is high on treble , better speakers could have been provided.",POSITIVE
"Top quality TVs (Sony, Samsung, LG) are about 2.5-3 times the price... cheap TV (but reputed names.. like MI, Micromax) are abt 2 times this price - this is so low price (other similar priced TVs were of unknown brands.. Kevin has made some name/presence by now), I was pretty sure it was a cheap quality dud! I thought if this TV lasted the warranty period, then its still value for money,... so i took the risk. TV arrived.. it stopped working on the same day!!!!!! inspection+replacement request registered with amazon.. smooth experience there, finally replaced.. and the new TV works perfectly. Note - the installation+warranty time servicing+repairs etc.. has been outsourced by Kevin to a third party company called Jeeves.. they're all digital, with all communications and visits etc recorded via sms-es, emails, etc... very professional. So, if tv ever gets spoilt, the toll-free experience+service/repair experience should be trouble-free. Also Note - There is an extended warranty provided at the time of purchase - for such a cheap tv, if I had 1 yr of extra warranty, then why not? But fr some reason I could not purchase the extended warranty. But at the time of installation, the Jeeves technician offered me extended warranty from them - so, i bought - 2 yrs for 1100Rs. Am glad I couldn't buy extended warranty at time of checkout.. and since Jeeves is the main entity handling repairs etc, it was better to buy from them... So now my cheap TV has a 1+2=3yr warranty! Nice!!!  TV - picture quality - OK.. does the job pretty well, the 15k-20k+Rs TV will be better.. but I don't care, at this price. The non-HD channels have slightly pixellated edges, but I noticed that if I reduced the sharpness to 0, the problem goes away. Everything else is all good - only thing is the ""whites"" seems a bit over-exposed/too bright, and if you reduce the brightness and contrast so that pure white ares of the picture looks alright, then the dark/shadowy/black areas of the picture appear too dark... you have to strike a balance(best settings worked for me at - Brightness-55, Contrast-35, Sharpness-0, Colour/Saturation-35... good balance of reducing overexposed whites and maximising dark-zone clarity), but trust me.. at this price, this is nothing, and you would have a good viewing experience. All other features - eco mode, sound, build quality etc is pretty decent.. no complaints there.  Final verdict - Go for it! super low price, pretty good viewing experience.. total value for money.. definitely go for it if your priority is getting max for your money.. if priority is quality, go for samsung, lg etc. Also, I'd suggest - skip the extended warranty and buy the same at installation time from the Jeeves technician - he may not offer it to you on his own, so ask for it.",NEGATIVE
"Here's a sample review:  *Disappointed with Post-Purchase Experience - Chargeable Installation*  *Rating: 2/5*  I purchased the vw tv from Amazon on 20 oct and received it on 24th October. The delivery was prompt, and the product seems to be in good condition.  However, my excitement was short-lived. When I contacted the installation team, I was informed that installation would be chargeable, which was not mentioned at the time of purchase. This added expense was unexpected and feels like a bait-and-switch.  *Pros:*  - Prompt delivery - Good product quality  *Cons:*  - Misleading information regarding installation costs - Additional charges for installation  *Suggestions:*  - Clearly mention installation costs (if applicable) on the product page - Provide transparent and accurate information to customers before purchase  *Recommendation:*  While the TV itself is satisfactory, the post-purchase experience has left a sour taste. Buyers, beware of potential additional costs. Amazon, please clarify installation costs upfront to avoid disappointing customers.",NEGATIVE
EXCELLENT PRODUCT WITH GOOD REASONABLE AMOUNT MY FAMILY IS VERY HAPY,POSITIVE
"I am extremely impressed with this VW TV! The picture quality is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and sharp details, making it perfect for watching movies and shows. The sound is also surprisingly good for a TV of this size, filling the room nicely without needing a soundbar. The setup was quick and easy, and the smart features work flawlessly, allowing me to stream all my favorite apps without any lag. It's a great value for the price, perfect for smaller rooms or as a second TV. Highly recommend.",POSITIVE
Better product better price,POSITIVE
Best product in this price range. No other brands provide such type of features in this price range. Pros- 1. Best picture quality 2. Good sound quality. 20W speaker provide nice sound for watching movies and tv series. 3. Good customer care support 4. Android OS and playstore available. 5. All connectivity ports are available. Cons. * Installation services is very bad. Service provider not available even after 10 days of delivery.,NEGATIVE
"*Non-Biased review, read full and make your decision*  Size ordered: 43 Inches Price for which I bought: 23,262(Credit Card Discount Included) (For fitting of TV you have to contact LG by yourself, the installation is free you have to show the amazon invoice)  In-Box: TV, HDMI Cable, Stand Legs, Screws and Some Paper Work  Pros: - Really premium finish and build quality - Smooth UI - Best picture quality and colors under 30-35K range(Trust me) - Really good speakers - A reliable and good performing processor  Cons: - Not mentioned whether IPS or VA(my unit is IPS I guess) - Nothing else, everything worked fine for me (Will update if I find some issues in future)  Review: So the room where the TV is fitted is a living room, not too big not too small. The first impressions of TV were outstanding I mean the price that you are paying for the TV is clearly justified. Upgrading from smaller 32 inches TV the upgrade was kinda huge for me and I was stunned to see the 4K picture quality for first time.  Earlier I had a Sony Bravia TV and according to me sony gives the best picture quality a TV can give, but LG changed my mind. In just a few years the quality has improved drastically. The blacks are really good even in an IPS panel. Again I am not sure what panel it is, it's just and estimate.  The speakers are clearly more than enough for me. Like on full volume my floor sorts of vibrate, and I don't even have to bother about a sound bar anymore.  The SD channels, the quality they provide are really surprising. The upscaling has improved a lot and I can say you can enjoy SD channels on this TV too. And for HD channels, I don't have much to say but ""AMAZING"".  Earlier I was leaning towards other 43 inches TV's of Hisense and Acer, but spending some extra money to get LG was totally worth it. Other alternatives: Samsung Crystal 4k Series but I prefer LG after it's performance.  Totally recommend, you can buy this product.",POSITIVE
"It’s a nice big screen tv, this one is 55”, looks sturdy and well built, good quality full HD images and supports Dolby 5.1, good pixel ratio as well and was very easy to get wall mounted! The only cons I’d say is that it comes with a moveable adjustable wall mount stand, but it’s a little too tight and difficult to move front and back, but is easy when moved sideways; and the response time sometimes is usually slow for certain actions. Unique remote, if you want the remote seen in the above video then you gotta select the magic remote option while selecting the variant. The TV can also be controlled entirely through your phone via the LG ThinQ app, has all Options exactly like it’s remote. Worth the price, got it at a deal.",POSITIVE
"Just purchased this bad boy and I couldn't be happier! The picture quality is stunning, with realistic to vibrant colors that make every scene immersive.  AUDIO- • The sound is immersive and comes with different modes to focus on dialogues or cinematic sound, delivering clear and loud audio that fills the room. I just need 45-50 % audio to hear each element clearly.  FEATURE • Navigating through the smart features is a breeze, thanks to the magic remote ( which I paid extra 2400rs for the installation guy). Although this caused the tv to run fast which causes lag sometimes. Magic remote also gives you additional features which is not possible with the simple remote.  DISPLAY- •The colours are close to realistic . And you can select how you want to view what you're watching with different colour modes. There's also a gaming mode for play station ( I don't own one yet so I'm going to add the review when I'm purchasing it  Overall, this TV offers fantastic value for its price. I purchased this for 26K (The one which I purchased is 43 inches and I got the Wall mount for free which was worth 500rs )",POSITIVE

"I love the image and color, It's a good quality budget TV anyone can buy it. It has loud and clear sounds, It also has many features like changing sound types including AI, It has lot's of functionalities with modern AI, You can change TV color effects or filters, You can cast your TV with your Mobile devices but it may buffer frequently i,ve tried myself, It is excellent if you are using wifi networks because the quality of 4k and 8k videos are insane!

"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE
Samsung products are good. Installation service is also good. Performance and display quality is very best. Really value for money. I bought this with the brand name.,POSITIVE
"Best experience of this television, superb",POSITIVE
"super experience navigating , design, how minutely given thoughts in every angle of functionality and user experience. sound quality no doubt even at 100 it doesn't hurt your ear",POSITIVE
It's 💯 % waste of money. My suggestion is don't go for it. Because I purchased the TV by paying 2 lakhs 75 thousand. I trusted the brand. But it's very shocking and sad news for me just after two years the display panel is damaged and now they are asking 1lakh 15 thousand for replacement of display panel. After paying such a huge amount everyones expectation is that atleast it could be useful for 10 years. It's waste of money. So my suggestion is don't go for this brand. I trusted it and faced a very huge loss.,NEGATIVE
Working fine till now.,POSITIVE
Sony OLED 55 inch TV is perfect for bedroom. Delivery was quick and the Sony agent personnel was exceptional in installation.,POSITIVE
"Sony Vigneshwar Service center, Mr. Jagadeesh clearly gave the demo and installed the tv perfectly without any issues. I am very very happy with the service.",POSITIVE

Value for money,POSITIVE
What a nice picture quality !! Love the high definition look of the movie on television. And volume quality is also good,POSITIVE
"Overall a value product (75 inch) with very good quality. Happy with the sound and screen brightness. Design could have been sleeker, yet Google TV makes it worth it",POSITIVE
Writing this review after 15 days of use I got the 55inch C61b for rs 31739 effective without no cost emi discount. For that price its a steal deal!! Pros: Sound - the 35w onkyo speaker system on this tv is beast. You won’t need a soundbar if your room is below 150 sqft. The bass is good. The sound clarity is superb. No distortion even in higher volumes. Best speaker system that I have seen in a tv. Picture- its a VA qled panel The picture quality is very good Blacks are deep Colours are punchy No complaints with picture fully satisfied The google tv os is very responsive with minor lags only after booting which goes away after sometimes. Dolby vision HDR HLG HDR10+ supports are there You need to adjust few settings to avoid motion smoothening issue Gaming mode is also there  Cons The con I felt is the little backlight bleeding on edges which you won’t notice normally But visible in grey screens not in black So not a big issue Installation is very late I got call after 8th day for installation  Overall this is the best tv you can buy under 40k Go for 55 inch or above the onkyo sound is superb Will definitely recommend,POSITIVE
TCL is very good picture quality with affordable price for this QLED TV and very nice audio experience. This TV is equal of samsung and sony and LG TV picture quality.  Worth product,POSITIVE
"Its a review of the 55 inch tv!!! PROS: 1. Design: With minimum bezels, its an updated design, feels premium by the sleek edges. 2. Display: The TV supports DOLBY vision, 4k with QLED. If you are upgrading from an HD tv, you are going to be blown away by the colour output it generates. The colour contrast with deep blacks is quite amazing. I personally haven't tried game mode so cannot comment. I have tried connecting my gaming laptop in HDMI, played FC24, it feels good by the amazing 55 inches display. The tv is quite bright even in sunny daylight. Viewing angle is also good. 3. Sound: The TV comes with a 20W speaker in the back, has a good bass and is quite loud. If you are music enthusiast, you won't be impressed. Its loud and clear and satisfactory when compared to other tv's in the market. No distortion even at 100% volume. 4. Connectivity: Wifi connectivity is good. I use my 5G phone for internet connection with unlimited pack. No lagging issues at all and its a GOOGLE TV so you get maximum app support. CONS: 1. Display: If you are a sports lover, you would be disappointed. The tv has jittering issues and motion clarity isn't good when it comes to sports. High action scenes with fast movement is where the tv lags. When watching cricket, the motion clarity isn't good enough. FINAL VERDICT: I bought this 55 inch tv for 34k. In this price point, you surely won't be disappointed at all. Its the best OLED TV you can find in the market. Trust me, even SAMSUNG, LG and SONY fails when compared with price. I personally visited Relaince Digital before buying the TV online. I compared all the TV's and bought this after thorough research. Buy this tv and you wouldn't regret at all. The only CON isn't a deal breaker at all. I love watching cricket and its ok with the jittering. I am pretty satisfied with the overall experience. I recommend buying the 4k pack of OTT's like Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime. You would love the overall viewing experience of watching movies and series in this huge display.",POSITIVE
I rarely give a 5 star .. It got amazing picture quality and decent soundd quality... The tv runs pretty fast and the blacks are so deep... Good upscaling... Best under 40k for 43inches tv,POSITIVE
Product is good but installation guys were in hurry..as they are service provider also hence not raised any complaint..,NEGATIVE
After using 3 weeks i must say I chosen the best 4K TV with the price best sound best picture quality best configuration best product best 4K best colours on the TV,POSITIVE
"I bought this TV for watching in my home. I like the build and the sleek design. One Important matter I want to bring to your notice is that communication within Amazon to its customers are leaking out....... After delivery, I was informed by Amazon that the technician will come the next day (Sunday) who didn't turn up. After that, I got another intimation from Amazon stating that a new technician will come the NEXT day for installation. He did. However, in between I got an anonymous call from UK stating that they are calling from Amazon and informed me of the technician's visit and asked me to confirm by pressing 1 or 9 to cancel.....!!!! I ignored the call. This is just for your information to take up matter within so as to plug any loophole in your communication leakage.",NEGATIVE
"I haven't used an android/google TV before. If you're already a heavy youtube user, the TV is for you. The picture quality is great despite its price, it delivers great value for your money. This TV is a price - performance monster, I can honestly say.",POSITIVE
"TV was okay initially but started running slowly after a couple months. The menu scrolling lags so much and TV restarts evertime I start apps like netflix. I have kept the software up to date and done all sorts of trouble shooting with no fix. Picture and sound quality are excellent but TV is so laggy and unpredictable. I would have returned it, but window is closed.",NEGATIVE
"Our old LG tv was past it's best and with strong sunlight the picture was very dark. We looked at TCL and Hisense in Currys but they didn't really seem interested in selling us one and were trying to push expensive Samsung's onto us. We didn't want to spend that much so retired to Costa for a coffee. Whilst there I looked on Amazon and noticed the price of the 50"" TCL had dropped to £299 so went for it, the Currys price was £374 at the time.  So far it has been very good with excellent picture quality, however this is an Android tv and setting it up was a pain with not much help from the manual. Altogether it took two days messing around to get a decent setup! Android is a mobile phone operating system owned by Google, so they really push you to either log in to your Google account or set one up. I'm not the greatest fan of Google because it wants to know too much of your business but there are a few videos on YouTube (also owned by Google!) about setting it up as a standalone. On all my old tv's you scan for channels and it works, not any more so beware.  Once I'd scanned all the channels in (nearly 1000!) the picture went to a ""Home screen"" and I hadn't got a clue what to do next. Eventually by a matter of trial and error and just pushing buttons on the remote I got onto a channel list and got Freeview to work, please note there is no built in Freesat on this as there was on our old LG. The channels were all over the place with BBC at about channel 45. Lots of channels didn't work with a message saying some dongle or other wasn't installed and to be honest I was not very impressed at the end of day 1.  On day 2 I decided to re-scan the channels and noticed a few options so opted for ""Free only"". This made a big difference and the ""dongle"" channels had disappeared. The channels were all still mixed up and then I noticed the channel list was in alphabetical order, so ITV was way down the list. This was getting more and more frustrating by the minute until I found a channel organizer in the settings. This brings up the channel list again but using the remote it's possible to click on a channel which brings an option box up. One of the options is ""Move"", by clicking on this option then clicking on another channel number the first channel moves to the new position. So I was able to move BBC1 to channel 1 and then spent the next few hours moving dozens of other channels as well. There is a ""Favourites"" option but I still haven't worked that one out yet.  Is it a good tv? I would say yes but be prepared for a lot of faffing about unless you are a wizz kid geek. I still haven't worked it all out but have got it so it's watchable but even now after a few weeks I still get confused by it, mainly trying to get from the home screen onto normal channels.",NEGATIVE

"I received the TV brand new, after i removed the tape, i saw that there are two huge dots where the pixels are dead.",NEGATIVE
"Overall a value product (75 inch) with very good quality. Happy with the sound and screen brightness. Design could have been sleeker, yet Google TV makes it worth it",POSITIVE
Writing this review after 15 days of use I got the 55inch C61b for rs 31739 effective without no cost emi discount. For that price its a steal deal!! Pros: Sound - the 35w onkyo speaker system on this tv is beast. You won’t need a soundbar if your room is below 150 sqft. The bass is good. The sound clarity is superb. No distortion even in higher volumes. Best speaker system that I have seen in a tv. Picture- its a VA qled panel The picture quality is very good Blacks are deep Colours are punchy No complaints with picture fully satisfied The google tv os is very responsive with minor lags only after booting which goes away after sometimes. Dolby vision HDR HLG HDR10+ supports are there You need to adjust few settings to avoid motion smoothening issue Gaming mode is also there  Cons The con I felt is the little backlight bleeding on edges which you won’t notice normally But visible in grey screens not in black So not a big issue Installation is very late I got call after 8th day for installation  Overall this is the best tv you can buy under 40k Go for 55 inch or above the onkyo sound is superb Will definitely recommend,POSITIVE
TCL is very good picture quality with affordable price for this QLED TV and very nice audio experience. This TV is equal of samsung and sony and LG TV picture quality.  Worth product,POSITIVE
"Its a review of the 55 inch tv!!! PROS: 1. Design: With minimum bezels, its an updated design, feels premium by the sleek edges. 2. Display: The TV supports DOLBY vision, 4k with QLED. If you are upgrading from an HD tv, you are going to be blown away by the colour output it generates. The colour contrast with deep blacks is quite amazing. I personally haven't tried game mode so cannot comment. I have tried connecting my gaming laptop in HDMI, played FC24, it feels good by the amazing 55 inches display. The tv is quite bright even in sunny daylight. Viewing angle is also good. 3. Sound: The TV comes with a 20W speaker in the back, has a good bass and is quite loud. If you are music enthusiast, you won't be impressed. Its loud and clear and satisfactory when compared to other tv's in the market. No distortion even at 100% volume. 4. Connectivity: Wifi connectivity is good. I use my 5G phone for internet connection with unlimited pack. No lagging issues at all and its a GOOGLE TV so you get maximum app support. CONS: 1. Display: If you are a sports lover, you would be disappointed. The tv has jittering issues and motion clarity isn't good when it comes to sports. High action scenes with fast movement is where the tv lags. When watching cricket, the motion clarity isn't good enough. FINAL VERDICT: I bought this 55 inch tv for 34k. In this price point, you surely won't be disappointed at all. Its the best OLED TV you can find in the market. Trust me, even SAMSUNG, LG and SONY fails when compared with price. I personally visited Relaince Digital before buying the TV online. I compared all the TV's and bought this after thorough research. Buy this tv and you wouldn't regret at all. The only CON isn't a deal breaker at all. I love watching cricket and its ok with the jittering. I am pretty satisfied with the overall experience. I recommend buying the 4k pack of OTT's like Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime. You would love the overall viewing experience of watching movies and series in this huge display.",POSITIVE
I rarely give a 5 star .. It got amazing picture quality and decent soundd quality... The tv runs pretty fast and the blacks are so deep... Good upscaling... Best under 40k for 43inches tv,POSITIVE
Product is good but installation guys were in hurry..as they are service provider also hence not raised any complaint..,NEGATIVE
After using 3 weeks i must say I chosen the best 4K TV with the price best sound best picture quality best configuration best product best 4K best colours on the TV,POSITIVE
"I bought this TV for watching in my home. I like the build and the sleek design. One Important matter I want to bring to your notice is that communication within Amazon to its customers are leaking out....... After delivery, I was informed by Amazon that the technician will come the next day (Sunday) who didn't turn up. After that, I got another intimation from Amazon stating that a new technician will come the NEXT day for installation. He did. However, in between I got an anonymous call from UK stating that they are calling from Amazon and informed me of the technician's visit and asked me to confirm by pressing 1 or 9 to cancel.....!!!! I ignored the call. This is just for your information to take up matter within so as to plug any loophole in your communication leakage.",NEGATIVE
"I haven't used an android/google TV before. If you're already a heavy youtube user, the TV is for you. The picture quality is great despite its price, it delivers great value for your money. This TV is a price - performance monster, I can honestly say.",POSITIVE
"TV was okay initially but started running slowly after a couple months. The menu scrolling lags so much and TV restarts evertime I start apps like netflix. I have kept the software up to date and done all sorts of trouble shooting with no fix. Picture and sound quality are excellent but TV is so laggy and unpredictable. I would have returned it, but window is closed.",NEGATIVE
"Our old LG tv was past it's best and with strong sunlight the picture was very dark. We looked at TCL and Hisense in Currys but they didn't really seem interested in selling us one and were trying to push expensive Samsung's onto us. We didn't want to spend that much so retired to Costa for a coffee. Whilst there I looked on Amazon and noticed the price of the 50"" TCL had dropped to £299 so went for it, the Currys price was £374 at the time.  So far it has been very good with excellent picture quality, however this is an Android tv and setting it up was a pain with not much help from the manual. Altogether it took two days messing around to get a decent setup! Android is a mobile phone operating system owned by Google, so they really push you to either log in to your Google account or set one up. I'm not the greatest fan of Google because it wants to know too much of your business but there are a few videos on YouTube (also owned by Google!) about setting it up as a standalone. On all my old tv's you scan for channels and it works, not any more so beware.

"Bought model of 2023 where 2024 model was already launched after comparing both I did not find any specific difference and 2023 model was available at 1000₹ additional discount so bought this. Initially i was planning to go for an google tv but this TV comes with 2 years warranty for Panel, so i changed my mind The panel if it stops working will almost cost you 50% of the original Tv so considering this additional warranty made my mind Storage is 8 Gb which definitely is low but all 32 inch tvs come with same storage capacity so no choice here Also Fire TV UI is lighter so lags are low as compared to Google or android TV Color quality and picture is perfect, can be viewed from all angles, wall mount is not part of the original packing and have to be bought separately. Sound is good and also the remote is simple and easy to use, got an update for the tv after buying, the only issue with this is network reception, it clearly requires a very strong wifi network any thing less then that the UI stucks, and at 50% network it won't work at all Phone is showing network and can be used to stream videos but for this tv it's no signal, so make sure you have a strong network where ever you install this.",NEGATIVE
Very good and excellent in the price range,POSITIVE
Best Telivision in this segment. Also available in very lowest price. Service provided by MI store is excellent,POSITIVE
"This TV uses Fire TV from Amazon and the battery of the remote dies down very quickly. I have to buy new batteries for almost every week. I even tried using the Android App to use as remote, but that app doesn't remember the connection, it would solve my remote draining problem If I could use the app forever. Anyways the TV as a TV is great, good picture quality, nice sound quality as well.",NEGATIVE
I am writing this review after just 3 days of usage. Product received earlier and come up with Good packaging. And then technician came after two days of delivery for installation. The picture Quality:- As per my view the picture Quality is good. This TV came up with HD Ready 720p resolution but you can play 1080p resolution Video on YouTube and picture Quality looks stunning seems like Full HD Video. Sound Quality:- This TV came up with Decent Sound Quality Not upto The Mark. Build Quality:- Good Note:- if you watch the TV from left or Right Side angle you will see Fade in Picture Quality. Watching From front will give you good Picture Quality.,POSITIVE

"I am impressed! This was my Diwali 2024 purchase. The picture and sound quality are top-notch, and the 4K videos are stunning.

Crystal clear quality and sound. Brand installation is super smooth and fast. Thnx amazon for such nice products.,POSITIVE
"Bought this after doing a lot of online research and going to a few TV stores in person. At this price point, (~1.25 L excluding discounts), I could have gone for an OLED but considering the issues with entry level OLEDs (which are available at that price point), I decided to go with this 55 inch TV - which is a full array LED.  One issue I faced was with internet speed. I have a broadband with 200 Mbps, but considering any issues with wifi, I got the LAN cable fixed up till the TV. I thought the speed would be fantastic. I was testing the Bravia Core app that is free for 2 years with the TV (which needs 80 Mbps). The sound was choppy and picture was constantly buffering. Wifi was even worse because thogh speed test showed 200 Mbps, the picture was constantly buffering for 4K content. When I checked the internet speed (with LAN cable and wifi disabled) from the TV (using Google play app), the speed was always 100 Mbps only. After some research online, I found out that the LAN port provided by Sony can handle only 100 Mbps max. As advised online, I bought an ethernet to USB3 adapter and the speed is good now (max speed of my broadband). We need to make sure that the ethernet to USB3 adapter we get should be plug-and-play and should support ChromeOS  Except for the issue with LAN speed, (mentioned above), overall am very happy with the TV.  My considerations for going with this TV: - My living room is highly ventilated. We don't have sunlight directly coming into the room, but it is very close to that and it is very bright. Hence, we needed a TV what was bright. - Price: Something in the 1 - 1.25 L range - Longevity - Want a TV that I need not replace for the next 7 years or so. As OLED is still maturing and has issues such as heating, burn-in and a slightly higher power consumption, went with this TV. Especially, the main issue is with burn-in. As most channels have the logo displayed prominently, it could cause an issue.  Pros: - Great picture quality. As mentioned in some online reviews, for a 4K content, I could not see much difference between this and OLED. The pure 4K content - checked from www.demolandia.net is stunning on this TV. - Good Audio - I connected my existing soundbar to this via bluetooth and the quality is very good. Could feel the bass and hear the dialogs in movies very clearly.  Cons: - Value for money - This is priced high compared to other brands and models. - Internet speed - Need to buy additional hardware (mentioned above) to utilize the full bandwidth and get a good 4K stream.",NEGATIVE
"The TV's picture and sound quality is awesome. Dark blacks, and night scenes are easily viweable. Installation experience to track and get it done from Sony/Amazon wasn't good. I had to make 3-4 calls dealing with dumb customer care executives of Amazon. Also, Amazon invoice copy mentioned a different Serial Number than what is provided over TV to me. Still struggling to get this correct with Sony and Amazon.  Edit (After 20 days of usage) Pros - stunning clarity and beautiful colours. Deep blacks Awesome sound quality experience, sound follows the direction. Relatively fast as compared to other Android TVs in market when you boot or navigate. SD content is also enhanced greatly for viewers experience. Bravia Core gives a different level of experience while watching movies in it. It has iMAX, DTS-x, Dolby 5.1 etc to immerse yourself.  Cons- Since its an Android TV, it will become outdated in a span of 5-7 years No option to lock your Google Profile (its an Android drawback for its TV platform rather than Sony's).",POSITIVE
Really nice product and quick service.,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the TCL C755 65-Inch TV, and it has exceeded all my expectations! The QD Mini LED technology truly brings 4K content to life with vibrant, accurate colors and incredible clarity. The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering punchy bass that eliminates the need for external speakers. The deep blacks enhance the overall viewing experience, making it feel more immersive and cinematic. Additionally, the Google TV operating system adds great convenience and seamless access to a wide range of apps and content. Gaming at 144Hz on this TV is an absolute game-changer, offering ultra-smooth performance that elevates the experience to a whole new level. A fantastic purchase all around!",POSITIVE
"Exceptional choice for those who demands best picture and sound quality, coupled with sleek design and impressive smart features makes it a top contender.",POSITIVE
"Bought the 85 inch version.The TV did not come with the center stand and they said that the stand is out of stock and I'll have to wait for 4-5 days to get it in stock. Got it installed in 4 days since TCL did not provide the service team with a stand.  From a TV perspective, it's a brilliant TV for it's price. The HDR performance is great, I have a dark theater setup and the black levels of the TV is very close to OLED levels with a bit of blooming. Not sure about the number of dimming zones, but should be around 800 for the 85 inch TV. The sound is decent and the audio performance is comparable to a mid priced soundbar. The colour accuracy is decent and the TV gets super bright in highlight areas in the HDR mode without much blooming. SDR upscaling is not great and you may not enjoy anything less than 1080p in such a large TV, but 1080p and 4k looks fantastic.  This TV is worth it's price and will not disappoint. 5 star for the performance, given the price. I reduced 1 star for not including stand in the box, delaying the TV setup  Edit : Spent a day more with the TV and it's actually amazing. Deep blacks, HDR+ content looks stunning and I'm reverting to 5 stars  I also see people complaining about the speed and responsiveness of the android TV interface, but it's pretty fluid. Very fast and never hangs.",POSITIVE
"Writing this review after 3 months. DON'T waste your hard earned money on this brand. I bought their so called best quality C825 for 1L over brands like Sony and LG - BIG mistake. Within a week the tv used to hang continuously while using regular apps like Netflix and Prime. Reached out to tech support and got it rectified. Thinking it was a minor issue (even though I don't know abt any other tv brand that hung so regularly) I let it pass. But now after a couple of months it doesn't detect wifi AT All. Tried factory reset. No use. Waiting for technician to visit. On the other hand I bought an LG OLED last year which works like a charm. No complaints whatsoever. This was not a cheap buy from any angle but the quality is far from even average. These brands try to lure you with promises on picture quality but there's more to a good tv than just good looking picture. What about the rest of the software to support it?  Update: More than fifteen days have gone by but there's no resolution of the issue. One technician has visited and diagnosed the problem saying the WIFI CARD HAS MALFUNCTIONED and needs to be replaced. But since then no visit, no call. Such a lackadaisical response in a major city like Mumbai, I can't imagine what it would be in tier 2 cities. Will keep updating about my experience with this.  UPDATE 2: After waiting for more than 15 days a TCL Technician came and replaced the wifi card. It worked. I was relieved. I thought my nightmare is over. But no. It wasn't to be. NEXT DAY itself, the wifi STOPPED WORKING AGAIN. Whats the use of having a SMART TV that can't connect to WIFI? I am at my wits end. What a mistake it was to buy this brand over LG, Samsung and Sony. Will update soon what happens next.  Update 3: Its been more than a month and my problem of malfunctioning wifi is yet to be resolved. I've written multiple mails which are answered by bots and on calls they assure me that they'll resolve the issue but no one has come and done it yet. My tv wifi conked off on 27th October. It's 2nd December today. Think about it would you have liked to stay without wifi on your smart tv for more than a month?",NEGATIVE
"TCL 65C755 Excellent picture quality. Sound quality for my hall is excellent with the Onkyo speakers. Appropriate media from various platforms are displayed in a wonderful way, although the information regarding the media played should have stayed somewhere on screen for longer. Film makers mode is not available in this brand as a picture mode. IMAX movies are played okay, but I do not know how to realize it is enhanced. But extremely good. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi connections are excellent, automatic. Bluetooth volume I found its quite low when I connected a home theatre. Probably there is nothing left out. Everything is configurable. Its upto one what he wants to use or leave it in auto. This is what fascinated me. At this price no other brand except Hisense offers this size TV with all the state-of-the-art technology. Hope they improve this further with updates periodically. If I do not tell about the remote and google TV it will be incomplete. Extremely good remote to use. All needed things provided. Google TV the most fluid one with Android TV 12 OS. What is bad . I have to search. It is an India made product. TCL Pls be available for prompt service if situation arises.",POSITIVE

"I recently purchased the Sony Bravia 43-inch 4K Ultra HD TV, and I must say it has exceeded all my expectations! The picture quality is stunning with 4K resolution and the X1 4K Processor. Watching content on it feels like an immersive experience, especially with features like 4K HDR and Motion Flow XR100 that make every scene come to life.  The wide viewing angle ensures that everyone in the room gets a perfect view, and the sound quality, powered by Dolby Audio and Open Baffle speakers, adds richness to the audio, making it feel like you're at a movie theater. The Clear Phase feature enhances the audio further, providing crystal-clear sound.  The smart TV features are incredibly user-friendly. Google TV, voice search, and built-in Chromecast make it easy to stream my favorite shows from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and more. It also supports Apple AirPlay and Alexa, which add convenience to the setup. The one-year warranty provided by Sony is an added bonus, ensuring peace of mind with my purchase.  Overall, I am beyond satisfied with this TV. It offers incredible value for money with a sleek design, top-notch picture and sound quality, and an amazing smart TV experience. Highly recommend it!",POSITIVE
"The Sony Bravia 43-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED Google TV (KD-43X64L) delivers stunning picture quality with vibrant colors and sharp details.

Build quality feels premium, and the setup was quick and hassle-free. Overall, it's an excellent choice for a feature-packed smart TV.",POSITIVE
"After a using the 65 inch model for a month, 'll divide the review into pros and cons.  Pros: - The TV IS large. You'll find the difference between the other sizes and this one while watching YouTube or movies/TV shows. It feels like a mini theatre.  - The sound is crisp and clear and the same time loud enough! So poud at just 60% volume. I never had to take it more than 60 and the average sound volume I use is around 45-50 which is enough!  - The quality of 4K is so crisp, even for 1080p Full HD videos. I compared it's quality with chinese brands like Mi, etc. and the difference in clarity is clearly visible.  - it's 4K processor is a notch above! It automatically enhances 1080p and 720p videos. The 720p videos are just good enough, but the 1080p videos are greatly enhanced. - You can connect this TV with you Alexa device and then configure it to perform functions just by giving it voice commands. - You can use the Google TV smartphone app to control the TV with your phone, using it as a remote from any room.  Cons: - Haven't found anything yet!  All in all, it was a good purchase. So if you're looking for a 65 inch great quality 4K TV within ₹1 lac, I'd recommend going for it.",POSITIVE

"**Functionality: 9/10** This Sony bravia X74L is packed with a wide array of smart features. It supports all major streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and more, making it a one-stop shop for all entertainment needs. Additionally, the TV is compatible with both Alexa and Google Assistant, so voice commands can be used to control it. The ability to use multiple input options (HDMI 2.1, USB, Ethernet, etc.) makes it highly functional for different use cases.  **Performance: 10/10** In terms of picture quality, this LED TV is outstanding. The deep blacks, high contrast, and vibrant colors create a stunning viewing experience. Motion handling is excellent, with minimal blurring in fast-moving scenes, making it perfect for sports or action movies. HDR10+ features optimize picture quality scene-by-scene, making content look more lifelike and immersive. Sound performance is also good for a TV, due to lack of Dolby Atmos; you may want an external sound system for a true home theater experience.  **Value for Money: 8/10** This TV is certainly not cheap, but for LED picture quality and top-tier smart features, it’s worth the investment. If you're a movie enthusiast, gamer, or someone who values top-notch display quality, this TV provides solid value for the money.  **Ease of Use: 8.5/10** Setting up the TV is simple, interface being user-friendly and intuitive. The Magic Remote, which acts as both a traditional and a pointer-based controller, makes navigation easy and convenient. Voice control integration through Alexa or Google Assistant further enhances ease of use.  **Lag: 9/10** For regular viewing, the TV has negligible input lag, making it perfect for sports, live TV, and movies. For gamers, input lag in Game Mode is remarkably low (around 12 ms), especially when connected via HDMI 2.1. This makes it one of the best TVs for console and PC gaming. There is no noticeable lag when using apps or navigating menus, ensuring a smooth and fluid user experience.  **Overall Rating: 9/10** The Sony Bravia stands out for its exceptional performance, particularly in picture quality, speed, and functionality. While it might not be the cheapest option, it delivers excellent value for those looking for a premium viewing experience, especially if you enjoy gaming or watching high-definition content. If ease of use and low lag are priorities, this TV won’t disappoint.",POSITIVE
Samsung qn90b is a fantastic tv black levels are good enough for moderate to high HDR experience I have come from the LG C9 and I don't think that qled have reached that level of contrast yet so don't expect that but the overall picture quality is absolutely incredible actually I was starting to see some dead pixels on my OLED tv so I sold it and bought this one and I don't have any regret except it's OS Tizen is like 'Baba Aadum ke jamane ka OS' Its freaking slow man,POSITIVE
"Lot of confusion between Amazon, Samsung and their local installation team. Wanted to get wall mount done but each of them seems to point to other to get the wall mount. As a customer you have to call them one by one. Installation service is nightmare. They were not ready to install with wall mount I purchased nor were willing to get one for extra money. Finally returned the TV after a week. Samsung service in Chennai has degraded in last 2-3 years.",NEGATIVE
"Picture quality is good with 1080p content and great with 4k content. Movies & TV shows streamed in 4K look fantastic. While I find the contrast impressive enough for me, do not expect OLED level contrast. I went with qled instead of oled to avoid screen burn issue & for the additional brightness offered by qled. I always use the movie maker mode as it's the most balanced of all the picture settings. This setting also switches off any motion processing that could end up with soap opera effect. Sound is clear & decent with the amplifier setting turned on but then I seldom use the TV speakers as I have an AV receiver connected to it. The deal breaker is the Tizen OS which looks ancient, dated and lacking compared to Android or probably even Web OS on LG TV (hence knocking off 1 star in my rating). For starters, Amazon music app is not in the apps list while Apple music is in it. Wonder what's the deal with that. They even have Amazon prime video but not the music. There are very few apps in the list. While the TV supports a reasonable number of formats when you are trying to play video directly on it, it still doesn't support some of the audio formats (for eg DTS HD MA is no go) and it doesn't pass that through to my receiver either. Sony TV is worst in that regard but the ones with Android OS easily makes up for it by offering apps that support such playbacks. While  Android OS also have some limitations in what they can output while playing some video formats, its far more versatile. The Tizen OS seems a bit slow too. While trying to connect my laptop to use TV as a wireless display it takes over a minute or two to happen but my 6 year old Samsung TV does it so much faster. Netflix seems to have better picture on Apple TV 4K than direct on this TV. But this is something many have observed on other TV models too. However if you don't have an Apple TV to compare, there is nothing missing. I'm yet to compare other streaming platforms. The Bluetooth remote is functional enough. It's good they have switched to a rechargeable one and also has a light panel at the back to charge from ambient light, when not in use. Also it seems to have automatically paired with the Apple TV. This means the TV remote can control the Apple TV, thereby minimizing the number of remotes you need to have around. However I still prefer the Apple TV remote due to its intuitive touch sensitive track pad option. The order and delivery experience through Amazon is 5 stars and the same rating applies for the installation process too. Please note they will install only on the stand that comes with the TV (or) on a wall mount provided by them (they may have more than one model at extra cost).",POSITIVE
"Very bright TV, HDR is good, Black levels are also awesome. I have 3 months time with this TV, the UI of the TV is usable, it stutters a lot sometimes, the amount paid for this TV, it shouldn't be happening. However you don't pay the money for the software experience but you pay for the overall picture quality from the panel which is world class.",POSITIVE
Delivered on 22nd and still chasing amazon customer service and now Samsung customer service for getting it installed and demoed. They cancel their installation requests on their own without reaching out to the customers and have taken them for granted. Just pathetic!,NEGATIVE
"Picture, dark, brightness sounds connectivity all are very fine",POSITIVE
Happy with good product and rejeble pricing iam happy with perfameance and remote condition is good Desin also very good,POSITIVE
Box received in open condition and stickers had removed from tv. Looks like used tv.,NEGATIVE
"This one is hands down best combo of firetv stick and Indian made TV. This is 2020 version (H1F1), which has 20W sound instead of old 16W sound. Picture quality is great, sound is nice. Best part, apps and firetv stick responds so quick that my old Sony smart-tv looks lost in league. First time updates and everything will take time but is easy. Remote is much better than Alexa and Mi. Also supports voice command and screen off while listening music. Tons of apps and regular firmware update. In the end, in this small city ... Onida customer care called, fixed a technician appointment and then tech came. He checked the TV for damages and wrote down the warranty card with direct call number. Chinese... Brands... Go back from India. We have a contender now.",POSITIVE
"I ordered Onida 32 inch after going through several other options available (Mi. etc) Initially, it look some time due to updates, and once done, it started working smoothly. Sound quality is fine (considering 15k price range), Picture quality is nice. This TV 'Fire TV OS', which I found only little bit lag, but manageable. Overall I can say - under 15k, this is a smart and good choice.",POSITIVE
Tv is good but remote quality is not good,NEGATIVE
With in 3 days of usgae the TV stopped working...now no power..not worth buying.,NEGATIVE
Video picture quality best lowest price best TV,NEGATIVE
"*1 day review*  Amazon delivered the product within 24 hrs. Person from ONIDA came for installation within 48 hrs as they promised. Completely satisfy with picture and sound quality. (My previous TV was 20yrs old box type tv, so i dont know picture quality of other LED or LCD tv.) Connectivity is also good. No buffering on wifi, mobile casting works fine and faced no issues while using USB pendrives.  I will also upload 6 months review.",POSITIVE
This tv is value for money. It responds really fast to the remote. The picture and sound quality are really nice. You Dont need a sound bar with it. And no such problem of internet connection getting lost. It works so smooth once connected. Overall a very nice tv to buy. I am happy that I bought it after going through all the options. A thumbs up from me.,POSITIVE
"I have bought new TV in December 2020. I am continuously facing the issue of ""Power Drain"" in my New Remote. I realized this problem a month of use after my purchase. I immediately made a complaint to Onida for replacement. It's almost 5 months, I haven't received any replacement from the company. Every time I am following with them to know about replacement and they are ensuring I will receive new remote but not giving any timeline. It's really a painful experience in the after sale service with Onida. Have a second thought about After Sale Service before buying Onida Products. Also Sound fluctuation issue (sometimes suddenly sound ups and down) and voice recognition issue with remote, was raised service request with in warranty period. Service guys (2 members) visited my place, and upgraded software and checked remote, reset the remote. and as they have suggested batteries draining issue will check after 2 days observation. Later no update and no one visited. again when I have called the support they just told me that the service request is closed and your complaint is resolved.. I have raised complaint again and now this the 10th time in past 6 months I’m raising a complaint for the same issue… let’s s see.. if this’ll not work now the for sure I’ll blow the product on fire somewhere at Onida Showroom…",NEGATIVE
"It's nothing new. It's the same old generation sony panel. If you have a older 70L or 75L model, then it's exactly the same with a bit of software tweaks.  Pros: 1. Panel is vibrant. Contrast ration is okay for the price. The HDR content looks absolutely amazing. 2. It's google tv with it's usual google TV glory. Easy to use as a google TV can be. 3. Functions as intended. Can side load apps but be careful with that. 4. Have 2 HDMI ports, so if you want you can connect PS5 and a music system with HDMI/ARC. 5. Speaker is a 2 × 20W speaker. It is decently loud for a 15×10 ft room that we have. 6. I saw some reviewers calling it a 50HZ TV. It's not. It's 60Hz, so don't worry. You can do some casual gaming on it. 7. Voice controls works great.  Cons: 1. personalizing the image output is a bit hard since the settings are hidden. Also they don't give you a test image or video to set it.  2. The remote is fine. Not great. Doesn't have number pad so if you're using any D2H or cable network, you have to use their remote. So in those cases you will need to shuffle around with 2 remotes.  3. No wall mounting system in the box and the one company provides for free isn't flexible. Thisbis outrageous. Why would you not provide a flexible wall mount for free?!  4. Performance can sometimes lag in the UI.  That's all. It's a decent TV. The sony panel is great.  Few suggestion for future buyers.  Keep the picture mode in either ""game"" or ""cinema"", if you like natural colours and less bright, pleasing image output.  If you're into bright or vibrant content viewing, go with ""photo"" mode.  Stay away from every other modes, they just destroy the volour accuracy of the panel. The panels best colour reproduction is already to vibrant I'm with kore emphasis on green and blue. So don't go with other modes than these three.  If you know about tuning up image then sure do personalize it, advance options are available. But if you're novice, stick to these three modes.  Also, if you're sitting less than 5 feet away form the TV, don't enable motion flow. It will create artifacts that will be noticeable at less distance from the tv.",NEGATIVE
"The Sony Bravia S2 Series is fantastic! The picture is crystal clear with vibrant colors, and the Google TV features are super easy to use. Voice control with Google Assistant is a huge plus. Sleek design and great sound—definitely worth every penny!",POSITIVE
"excellent picture quality, good sound quality of speakers and service/installation agent is quite intelligent and have patience and knowledge to perform work.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this Sony bravia 2 50-Inch 4K Smart TV, and I'm impressed with its overall performance. The TV's design is sleek and modern, with thin bezels and a sturdy stand.  The picture quality is excellent, with vibrant colors and good contrast. The TV supports HDR10 and HLG, which enhances the viewing experience. I also appreciate the TV's wide viewing angle, which makes it perfect for family movie nights.  The TV's performance is also impressive, with fast response times and low input lag. I didn't encounter any issues with screen tearing or motion blur.  The smart TV features are also well-implemented, with a user-friendly interface and a wide selection of apps. I appreciate the TV's support for voice control through the remote or smart speakers.  Gaming performance is also excellent, with low input lag and fast response times. The TV supports HDMI 2.1 and VRR, which enhances the gaming experience.  The sound quality is also good, with clear dialogue and decent bass. However, I recommend using a separate sound system for a more immersive experience.  Overall, I'm impressed with the Sony 50-Inch 4K Smart TV. It offers excellent picture quality, fast performance, and well-implemented smart TV features. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality TV.""",POSITIVE

Sony products is good. Good picture quality And sound.,POSITIVE
Tv is good and product installation done very quickly,POSITIVE
"Yo, so this TV has some sick brightness and black levels, especially if you're sitting in the sweet spot. The 120Hz refresh rate, which can go up to 144Hz, is perfect for gaming. It's like, super smooth. Watching movies and TV shows on this thing is like going to the cinema, but without the overpriced popcorn. The design is sleek and it'll look dope in any room. It also boots up super fast, so you don't have to wait ages to watch your stuff. The operating system is easy to use and responds quickly. Oh, and they even threw in a solar remote, which is pretty cool and eco-friendly.  Now, here's the thing. The speakers aren't the best, so you might want to get a soundbar if you want better sound. Also, if you're not sitting right in front of the TV, you might notice some blooming, which can be annoying. And the TV stand is super heavy, so be ready for a workout when you set it up or move it.  If you're looking for a TV that's great for gaming and watching movies, this is a solid choice. Just pair it with a soundbar for better audio, and you're good to go.",POSITIVE
"Picture Quality is very nice, much better than standard LED TV (Standard Samsung or Sony Bravia 3 hat I got for other rooms). How can I say that, my 72 year old dad can recognize it and actually asked me ""That TV in hall, the picture looks much better than others. Whats the difference?"" Audio is also very good, I don't complain at all, but there is scope for improvement.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung QN90C TV from Amazon, and while I'm impressed with the picture quality, the overall experience was soured by Samsung's customer service.  The TV was delivered on 9th August, but by 12th August, no one had come to install it. When the service center finally contacted me, I requested a wall mount installation. They informed me that Amazon was responsible for providing the wall mount, which wasn’t mentioned anywhere in the product details. When I offered to pay for the wall mount, they flat-out refused, saying they didn’t have any and to ask Amazon instead. It was clear they were not interested in coming over the weekend.  After contacting Samsung's customer care multiple times and being promised a callback (which never happened), the service center canceled my installation order out of anger. When I found a VESA wall mount locally and requested installation, they refused because I hadn’t purchased the mount from them. In the end, I had to hire my local electrician to install the TV.  The TV itself is fantastic, with stunning picture quality. However, the sound is just average, so I’d recommend getting a soundbar. Despite loving the TV, I’m incredibly disappointed with Samsung’s customer service. The installation process should have been hassle-free, but instead, I had to chase them down multiple times and eventually handle it on my own. Next time, I might think twice before choosing Samsung, solely because of this poor service experience.  If you're buying this TV, be prepared for a great viewing experience but also to potentially deal with frustrating service issues.  Update 1 week gone . Still nobody came from samsung service center",NEGATIVE
"Samsung TVs are the best and if you want to buy the best 50inch tv, then just go for it. This is the best you can get. Best for both watching TV and play games. Viewing angles are really good. The intelligent features are good and I like the Samsung TV ui. Very user-friendly and the Samsung TV Plus app is really a great app to watch live tv without any cable connection.  Only con is sound loudness. This is true for all Samsung TVs. Sound could be louder.",POSITIVE
Quick response of the system. Good quality of picture with nice anti reflection in this model. Software OS isn't to my liking though scrolling and finding is not so easy. Sound quality average.(You will need speakers to enjoy your content),POSITIVE
I liked picture & sound quality,POSITIVE
One of the best tv in market and at amazing discount...picture quality is 👌,POSITIVE
"This TV is not worth the money , Please don’t but this instead of buy a good Sony or lg with this price. They have tempted with the free sound bar worth 40k but we never received it . It’s just a Bussiness tricks to get that after the return period is over Please don’t cheat us like this Samsung.",NEGATIVE
Not correct information about product.,NEGATIVE
"Value For Money, Picture Clarity & Sound Quality Is Really Really Awesome Really I Liked This Product Quality Of Product is No.1 Installation Is Also Very Simple Size & Design Altimate.",POSITIVE
"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE
Samsung products are good. Installation service is also good. Performance and display quality is very best. Really value for money. I bought this with the brand name.,POSITIVE
"Background : I was in search for a good but not pricey TV because of the following  1. My Samsung 49"" K6300 Curved TV had gone kaput in 4-5 years (DOP - Somewhere in 2017 - early 2018) 2. I was dragging my old TV with ever growing shadows accompanied with visibility issues. 3. K6300 was an eye pleasure when in good condition with amazing blacks and motion smoothness - beautiful out of the box colors.  Since a Tier 1 brand like Samsung had betrayed the trust after paying a premium , I was in the lookout of a mid range TV with up-to-date features - my check list included the following  1. Solid warranty clause with no Money extorsion policies like LG OLED post 1 year end. 2. Good sound system - Preferably with a sub-woofer. 3. Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.  I think I am tending to increase ratings from 4 to 5 stars. Just for the REGZA Pic & Sound from Toshiba.  Good and durable Japanese brands Like Sanyo, Toshiba, Panasonic ( that bring in proprietary tech) should be endorsed (even thought they may be manufactured locally under strategic partnerships) by the Indians else everything is gonna be PRC/Korea Inspired.",POSITIVE
"Initially I want to buy infinix qled t.v because of earlier experience with the brand was good moreover it was 8000 Rs economical to Toshiba but I switch over to Toshiba because of brand reputation most of the well-known brands like infinix,Motorola,Kodak,Blaupunkt, Thomson etc. used to market third party manufacturers product though I am not certain Toshiba manufacturer this t.v or it is also playing the same game but I take a bet because of goodwill and three years of warranty which no other brand is providing.I have been using the t.v for three months I have following observations about this t.v- 1-Picture quality is great (Good contrast,Punchy colours, Wide colour gamut,No screen bleeding issues,Deeper black level) can be good or at par with brands like Samsung,LG, Panasonic inferior to Sony) so there is no comparison with other brands they will fall short. 2- Toshiba's proprietary Regza chip is damm fast as well as do best upscaling moreover it's own ui makes it fast in comparison to android t.v's present in the market don't compare it's ram and rom because it can do it's work swiftly in comparision with brands having double ram and rom nodoubt because of rom storage can be issue for some. 3- Sound quality is great to me it varies person to person vocals are clear and crisp, lacking bass and surround experience is great.sound is pleasing in most of scenarios like 4k movies, webseries,games,news, loudness is sufficient for room 12×15 size of room is at par with Samsung and LG t.v's of this size. 4- settings menu is easily operable, build quality is good,great aesthetics with well built functional remote. Can be improved -. 1- Bass 2-behaves like va panel so viewing angles are not that great but not that much colour shift is seen. After one month see my video review of this t.v on my YouTube channel shobhits exact evaluation .",POSITIVE
"I've had this TV now for near 4 months. The positives are that the build quality, picture quality & sound quality are all great. The only two negatives are the OS & the lack of Filmmaker mode. So I recommend getting a FireTV device or a similar device to remedy the OS issue; the lack of Filmmaker mode means you will need to manually adjust the picture quality to give you the best viewing experience possible. Having said this the TV is still a very good buy at the price.",POSITIVE

Overall, the Acer 40-inch Smart Full HD TV combines quality performance with user-friendly features, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment experience. Highly recommended for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike!",POSITIVE
"Putting this review after almost a month of usage. Picture quality and streaming quality is good. Display colour and sound also great. But lagging in performance, bluetooth remote sometimes not working, and only works through IR mode. Surfing between apps is still a bad experience. Viewing files in the pendrive is so much difficult. Even a 720p video can't be played smoothly when it's on my pendrive, but streaming a 1080p video through ott apps still works smoother. User interface is good, adjusting screen brightness, making some changes in the settings during an app usage is better than MI TVs. On an average It's good for the pricing, but it's not promising the specifications mentioned by the company, Acer should improve these things in the upcoming updates.",NEGATIVE
The acer I pro 43 inch 4k tv has very nice picture quality. There is minor lag in settings. Other then that UI is very smooth. My only problem is with the video playback from external hard disk. The inbuilt media player keep crashing while play 4k movies. some time takes too much time to load videos from hard disk and also sometimes it got stuck while fast forwarding. The issue doesn't solve with other media player. Nova player works fine in this tv but doesn't support HDR . The MX plays can play HDR videos but keeps freezing in this. (Both player works fine with my mi box 4k). I purchased this tv hoping the newer processor in this model will be more powerful but that's not the case. Or it may be it is some optimization problem. Otherwise tha picture quality is very good while playing online videos.,NEGATIVE
"Today, I received my Acer I Pro 55-inch TV, and after watching it, I want to share my review with all of you. This review will focus on my experience with the VA panel TV.  After watching multiple reviews on YouTube, I bought this TV, but I am very disappointed with those YouTubers. While they highlighted many positive aspects of the TV, they did not properly explain the limitations of the VA panel.  Here’s the issue: VA panels lose color accuracy when viewed from angles beyond 20 degrees. These panels are excellent if you’re viewing the TV directly from the front, where they provide 100% color accuracy. However, as soon as you change your viewing angle, you will notice significant color distortion. The picture begins to fade, and if your seating position changes to 30 to 40 degrees, the colors look completely washed out, and the picture loses its vibrancy.  Based on my experience, I strongly suggest that before purchasing a large-screen TV, visit a store and compare VA panels TV with IPS panels TV, especially on SD channels, which many of us watch daily. This will help you make a more informed decision.",NEGATIVE
Good product,POSITIVE
"The TV itself is good, and I’ve owned TCL products before without issues. However, purchasing high-value items from Amazon comes with serious risks due to their poor post-purchase support.  Installation was repeatedly delayed, and despite multiple follow-ups, no resolution was provided. Customer support was unprofessional, unhelpful, and unwilling to take ownership of the issue. I ultimately had to return the product—not because of TCL, but due to Amazon’s failure to provide the necessary service.  If you’re considering buying expensive electronics here, be prepared for a frustrating experience if you ever need support.",NEGATIVE
Good quality for this price. If u choose other brands you have to pay ₹5000 to 15000 extra .,POSITIVE
"I bought TCL 75 inches 4K UHD LED TV after lot of research on specifications and price bargain.  This TV is really a catch @ Rs 69,990 when I bought in December 2023. Great deal on 75 inches TV. Thanks to TCL.  Moreover, the colours and brightness and viewing pleasure is really very satisfactory.  I was dreaming to buy Mini LED TV but it was very costly and out of my budget. So I closed down on this great value for money deal on TCL 75 inches giant screen TV at an amazing price tag of Rs 69,990.  Sound is 30W RMS. It's really crystal clear and very good to listen each minute audio detail. I have a soundbar but now no need to use it as the TV sound is almost like a soundbar and it's powerful.  TV has got HDMI eARC connectivity. I am using soundbar as well as Sony wireless headphone L600 - both with eARC connectivity. So it was super easy to connect my soundbar as well as wireles headphone with TCL TV seamlessly.  The remote controller unit is also very nice. It's bit slim and long which looks different from other brands and easy to handle. All required shortcut buttons are given.  It's a Google TV. So supports Google voice search.  We are very happy on our decision to buy TCL 75 inches 4K UHD TV.  I hope this TV will serve us for few years to come without any technical problems. I will post my post use feedback soon in next year 2024.  Thank you.",POSITIVE
TCL is affordable price very good picture quality this TV equal samsung & Sony viewing experience,POSITIVE
Quality is very good.,POSITIVE
"We bought the TV 3 months back. In a month, the TV started getting hanged and did not work smoothly. Even after following all the instructions, the problem didn't get solved. Also the after service of the company is pathetic. When we asked to replace the product, they denied and did made reasons like technician will come and check the product. It's been more than 20 days we are trying to reach th but no one is responding to our complaint. Also the customer care number that is mentioned is of no use as no one answered or addressed our complaint. There is Lag, poor picture quality before the TV started getting hanged. And now TV is not working at all. It's stuck on TCL logo and keeping getting restart, doesn't go ahead of it. Never buy or go for TCL products as they don't respond or replace the product even when it's in the warranty period.  Just because it's less price, don't buy it as money gets wasted. Better to put extra and buy another brand.",NEGATIVE

We are asking this tv for last 6 months now. Haven’t faced any issues till now. Everything works fine. Picture quality is also good. Also our expectations were not great in terms of picture quality so it’s a good match for us. The Bluetooth is good. However there is one drawback in terms of asking pens drives and video formats. I would like to ask the makers which video format is supported by this brand. Its would be great if these instructions are also provided on box or tv for easy use. You much have species it in user manual but anyone hardly reads. Overall it’s a good buy for me.,POSITIVE
"*Zero Stars - Unacceptable Experience: VW32C2 Smart LED TV Review*  *Product Failed Within 6 Months: No Repair, No Response*  I purchased the VW 80 cm (32 inches) Linux Series Frameless HD Ready Smart LED TV (VW32C2) from Amazon, expecting a reliable product and decent after-sales service. Instead, I've experienced:  *Issues:*  1. *Blank Screen*: TV displays blank screen, rendering it unusable. 2. *Sound Only*: Only sound comes from the TV, no visual output. 3. *Frequent Freezing*: Occasional freezing issues before complete failure.  *Warranty and Support:*  1. *18-Month Warranty*: Meaningless, as VW's customer care is unresponsive. 2. *Complaint Registered*: 5-6 months ago, with no response or update. 3. *No Repair*: TV remains unrepaired, warranty useless.  *Amazon's Inaction:*  1. *No Response*: Despite multiple contacts with Amazon customer support. 2. *Lack of Escalation*: No effort to resolve or escalate the issue.  *Cons:*  1. Poor reliability and durability 2. Unresponsive customer care 3. Non-existent repair process 4. Misleading warranty claims 5. Amazon's ineffective customer support  *Pros:* (None)  *Recommendation:*  Avoid VW products and Amazon's ineffective customer support. Choose reputable brands with reliable after-sales service.  *Tips for Potential Buyers:*  1. Research thoroughly, reading reviews from multiple sources. 2. Check warranty terms and conditions. 3. Ensure purchase from authorized dealers. 4. Test products thoroughly before warranty expiration. 5. Look for brands with good after-sales service.  *Rating Breakdown:*  - Picture Quality: 1/5 - Design and Build: 2/5 - Smart Features: 2/5 - Reliability: 0/5 - After-Sales Service: 0/5 - Overall Value: 0/5  *Conclusion:*  My experience with VW32C2 and Amazon has been disastrous. The TV's failure within 6 months, combined with VW's and Amazon's inaction, makes this purchase a regrettable mistake. Do not invest in VW products or trust Amazon's customer support.  *UPDATE:* I will update this review if the situation changes, but as of now, the TV remains unrepaired, and I'm still awaiting a response from VW and Amazon.  *WARNING:* Beware of VW's misleading warranty claims and Amazon's ineffective customer support. Protect your hard-earned money and choose reputable brands with reliable after-sales service.",NEGATIVE

"The TV is good over all. TV picture quality: decent! Sound: average User interface: good The drawbacks are that since it's a Linux OS it does not connect to 5g Internet service and does not support Netflix app or any other mostly popular apps that will be pretty soon popular. So 1 needs to use a Fire TV stick to view Netflix amd other apps on this TV. 2. Also while using Fire Tv stick in this TV, 1 needs to use 2 remotes. Fire Tv stick remote to operate and navigate through apps and controls but the TV remote just for volume control!",NEGATIVE
"""Horrible Experience with VW 32-Inch LED TV""  I regret buying the VW 32-inch LED TV. At first, it seemed like a decent budget option, but it turned out to be a complete waste of money. After just two months of light use, the remote stopped working entirely. I replaced the batteries, reset the TV, and even tried universal remotes—nothing worked!  The customer service is even worse. Reaching them is like solving a puzzle, and when you finally get through, they’re unhelpful and dismissive. They suggested I buy a new remote at my own cost and price us 1200/- ! Why should I pay extra for their faulty product?  To make matters worse, the TV itself is slow and unresponsive when you try to operate it manually. The picture quality is mediocre at best, and the sound is tinny. This product has been nothing but frustration.  Save yourself and avoid this brand altogether. It’s not worth it!",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Sony X90L, and after spending some time with it, I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. Here’s a breakdown of what makes this TV stand out:  Picture Quality (5/5): The Sony X90L delivers exceptional picture quality with its Full Array LED panel and impressive HDR support. The colours are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, thanks to its local dimming feature. Watching movies in 4K HDR on this TV is a visual treat, as it handles both dark and bright scenes with remarkable clarity. The X90L also upscales lower-resolution content quite effectively, making even regular HD channels look significantly better.  Design and Build (4.5/5): Sony has maintained a sleek and modern design with the X90L. The thin bezels and sturdy stand give it a premium look that will complement any living room setup. However, the TV is slightly thicker than some OLED models due to the Full Array backlighting, but this is a minor trade-off for the superior picture quality.  Sound Quality (4/5): The sound quality is quite good for a TV at this price point. The X90L features Sony’s Acoustic Multi-Audio technology, which provides a more immersive audio experience. The dialogue is clear, and the built-in speakers deliver decent bass. For those looking for a more cinematic experience, pairing it with a soundbar or home theatre system is recommended.  Smart Features and Interface (5/5): The X90L runs on Google TV, offering a smooth and intuitive user interface. Navigating through apps and settings is a breeze, and the TV is quick to respond to commands. It comes with a wide range of streaming apps pre-installed, and the Google Assistant integration allows for voice control, which is a handy feature. The remote is well-designed with direct buttons for popular streaming services, making it user-friendly.  Gaming Performance (4.5/5): Gamers will appreciate the X90L’s support for HDMI 2.1, allowing for 4K gaming at 120Hz. The low input lag and VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) make it a solid choice for console gaming. The picture remains smooth even during fast-paced action scenes, providing an immersive gaming experience.  Value for Money (4.5/5): Considering the features and performance, the Sony X90L offers excellent value for money. It’s not the cheapest option on the market, but the quality justifies the price. This TV is ideal for anyone looking for a high-quality 4K experience without going for the more expensive OLED options.  Final Thoughts: The Sony X90L is a fantastic choice for those who want a premium viewing experience without the premium OLED price tag. With its excellent picture quality, robust smart features, and solid gaming performance, it’s a well-rounded TV that caters to a variety of entertainment needs. I highly recommend it!  This review is balanced, highlighting both the strengths and minor trade-offs of the Sony X90L. It should provide potential buyers with a clear understanding of what to expect from this model.",POSITIVE

"I recently purchased the Sony Bravia 43-inch 4K Ultra HD TV, and I must say it has exceeded all my expectations! The picture quality is stunning with 4K resolution and the X1 4K Processor. Watching content on it feels like an immersive experience, especially with features like 4K HDR and Motion Flow XR100 that make every scene come to life.  The wide viewing angle ensures that everyone in the room gets a perfect view, and the sound quality, powered by Dolby Audio and Open Baffle speakers, adds richness to the audio, making it feel like you're at a movie theater. The Clear Phase feature enhances the audio further, providing crystal-clear sound.  The smart TV features are incredibly user-friendly. Google TV, voice search, and built-in Chromecast make it easy to stream my favorite shows from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and more. It also supports Apple AirPlay and Alexa, which add convenience to the setup. The one-year warranty provided by Sony is an added bonus, ensuring peace of mind with my purchase.  Overall, I am beyond satisfied with this TV. It offers incredible value for money with a sleek design, top-notch picture and sound quality, and an amazing smart TV experience. Highly recommend it!",POSITIVE

Build quality feels premium, and the setup was quick and hassle-free. Overall, it's an excellent choice for a feature-packed smart TV.",POSITIVE
"After a using the 65 inch model for a month, 'll divide the review into pros and cons.  Pros: - The TV IS large. You'll find the difference between the other sizes and this one while watching YouTube or movies/TV shows. It feels like a mini theatre.  - The sound is crisp and clear and the same time loud enough! So poud at just 60% volume. I never had to take it more than 60 and the average sound volume I use is around 45-50 which is enough!  - The quality of 4K is so crisp, even for 1080p Full HD videos. I compared it's quality with chinese brands like Mi, etc. and the difference in clarity is clearly visible.  - it's 4K processor is a notch above! It automatically enhances 1080p and 720p videos. The 720p videos are just good enough, but the 1080p videos are greatly enhanced. - You can connect this TV with you Alexa device and then configure it to perform functions just by giving it voice commands. - You can use the Google TV smartphone app to control the TV with your phone, using it as a remote from any room.  Cons: - Haven't found anything yet!  All in all, it was a good purchase. So if you're looking for a 65 inch great quality 4K TV within ₹1 lac, I'd recommend going for it.",POSITIVE

"**Functionality: 9/10** This Sony bravia X74L is packed with a wide array of smart features. It supports all major streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and more, making it a one-stop shop for all entertainment needs. Additionally, the TV is compatible with both Alexa and Google Assistant, so voice commands can be used to control it. The ability to use multiple input options (HDMI 2.1, USB, Ethernet, etc.) makes it highly functional for different use cases.  **Performance: 10/10** In terms of picture quality, this LED TV is outstanding. The deep blacks, high contrast, and vibrant colors create a stunning viewing experience. Motion handling is excellent, with minimal blurring in fast-moving scenes, making it perfect for sports or action movies. HDR10+ features optimize picture quality scene-by-scene, making content look more lifelike and immersive. Sound performance is also good for a TV, due to lack of Dolby Atmos; you may want an external sound system for a true home theater experience.  **Value for Money: 8/10** This TV is certainly not cheap, but for LED picture quality and top-tier smart features, it’s worth the investment. If you're a movie enthusiast, gamer, or someone who values top-notch display quality, this TV provides solid value for the money.  **Ease of Use: 8.5/10** Setting up the TV is simple, interface being user-friendly and intuitive. The Magic Remote, which acts as both a traditional and a pointer-based controller, makes navigation easy and convenient. Voice control integration through Alexa or Google Assistant further enhances ease of use.  **Lag: 9/10** For regular viewing, the TV has negligible input lag, making it perfect for sports, live TV, and movies. For gamers, input lag in Game Mode is remarkably low (around 12 ms), especially when connected via HDMI 2.1. This makes it one of the best TVs for console and PC gaming. There is no noticeable lag when using apps or navigating menus, ensuring a smooth and fluid user experience.  **Overall Rating: 9/10** The Sony Bravia stands out for its exceptional performance, particularly in picture quality, speed, and functionality. While it might not be the cheapest option, it delivers excellent value for those looking for a premium viewing experience, especially if you enjoy gaming or watching high-definition content. If ease of use and low lag are priorities, this TV won’t disappoint.",POSITIVE
"When I decided to buy a smart TV l, I was looking for the best option. Xiomi was my first choice. But suddenly, I saw this product.

After using it for 10 days I can say that this one is the best budget SMART TV available on amazon with wonderful assistance from brand team. They are very helpful even more than AMAZON team.

"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE
Samsung products are good. Installation service is also good. Performance and display quality is very best. Really value for money. I bought this with the brand name.,POSITIVE
"Background : I was in search for a good but not pricey TV because of the following  1. My Samsung 49"" K6300 Curved TV had gone kaput in 4-5 years (DOP - Somewhere in 2017 - early 2018) 2. I was dragging my old TV with ever growing shadows accompanied with visibility issues. 3. K6300 was an eye pleasure when in good condition with amazing blacks and motion smoothness - beautiful out of the box colors.  Since a Tier 1 brand like Samsung had betrayed the trust after paying a premium , I was in the lookout of a mid range TV with up-to-date features - my check list included the following  1. Solid warranty clause with no Money extorsion policies like LG OLED post 1 year end. 2. Good sound system - Preferably with a sub-woofer. 3. Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.  I think I am tending to increase ratings from 4 to 5 stars. Just for the REGZA Pic & Sound from Toshiba.  Good and durable Japanese brands Like Sanyo, Toshiba, Panasonic ( that bring in proprietary tech) should be endorsed (even thought they may be manufactured locally under strategic partnerships) by the Indians else everything is gonna be PRC/Korea Inspired.",POSITIVE
"Initially I want to buy infinix qled t.v because of earlier experience with the brand was good moreover it was 8000 Rs economical to Toshiba but I switch over to Toshiba because of brand reputation most of the well-known brands like infinix,Motorola,Kodak,Blaupunkt, Thomson etc. used to market third party manufacturers product though I am not certain Toshiba manufacturer this t.v or it is also playing the same game but I take a bet because of goodwill and three years of warranty which no other brand is providing.I have been using the t.v for three months I have following observations about this t.v- 1-Picture quality is great (Good contrast,Punchy colours, Wide colour gamut,No screen bleeding issues,Deeper black level) can be good or at par with brands like Samsung,LG, Panasonic inferior to Sony) so there is no comparison with other brands they will fall short. 2- Toshiba's proprietary Regza chip is damm fast as well as do best upscaling moreover it's own ui makes it fast in comparison to android t.v's present in the market don't compare it's ram and rom because it can do it's work swiftly in comparision with brands having double ram and rom nodoubt because of rom storage can be issue for some. 3- Sound quality is great to me it varies person to person vocals are clear and crisp, lacking bass and surround experience is great.sound is pleasing in most of scenarios like 4k movies, webseries,games,news, loudness is sufficient for room 12×15 size of room is at par with Samsung and LG t.v's of this size. 4- settings menu is easily operable, build quality is good,great aesthetics with well built functional remote. Can be improved -. 1- Bass 2-behaves like va panel so viewing angles are not that great but not that much colour shift is seen. After one month see my video review of this t.v on my YouTube channel shobhits exact evaluation .",POSITIVE
"I've had this TV now for near 4 months. The positives are that the build quality, picture quality & sound quality are all great. The only two negatives are the OS & the lack of Filmmaker mode. So I recommend getting a FireTV device or a similar device to remedy the OS issue; the lack of Filmmaker mode means you will need to manually adjust the picture quality to give you the best viewing experience possible. Having said this the TV is still a very good buy at the price.",POSITIVE

After 1.5 months Tv is working fine. I hope it will go for a long term. Good picture quality. Good sound. OS is little bit slow. Till date no issues..,NEGATIVE
"I love the image and color, It's a good quality budget TV anyone can buy it. It has loud and clear sounds, It also has many features like changing sound types including AI, It has lot's of functionalities with modern AI, You can change TV color effects or filters, You can cast your TV with your Mobile devices but it may buffer frequently i,ve tried myself, It is excellent if you are using wifi networks because the quality of 4k and 8k videos are insane! Love it ❤️",POSITIVE
"Good picture quality,AI sound system,easy to use web os system was very nice, value for money.",POSITIVE
Picture quality is good Sound quality is superb...loud and clear No lag Design and build quality is good,POSITIVE
Price wise build quality is good. Screen quality is good. Sand quality is bad.  LG installation team did not come to installation. They did not call even.,NEGATIVE
Good choice in reasonable price.,POSITIVE
Overall good high quality HD TV...I love it pitcher.. sound quality...v.. good TV disine and display 5..renting...tq Amazon...,POSITIVE
The product is really Good. The installation was done immediately the next day and a neat demo was given. The product quality is good and nice and it is strongly recommended to anyone who is interested to buy a quality and cost-effective smart tv. The Tv has various features. Thank you Acer for the product quality.,POSITIVE
"1. Picture quality and clarity are superb. 8/10 2. Sound quality is also amazing. 9/10 3. Supported apps and UI (OS Google) are also smooth, but sometimes it tends to get laggy. 6/10 4. Connectivity is an issue; whenever I try to pair it with my Bluetooth device, it fails. 2/10 Overall, at such a price, it's a value for money.",NEGATIVE
This tv is a good and well performed.but some times it may be stucked and doesnot respond.but overall performance is good and clarity wise and sound quality it's nice tv.worth for money,POSITIVE
"The screen is bright and does its job quite well while displaying 4k content. Speakers are of only 36wh but the output is way better for an apartment type home. Its value for money definitely acer is doing amazing in budget TV section. The processor is one con that I discovered that it can get laggy, it forcefully gets out of apps to maintain the performance but you can sometimes feel the laggyness. I'd hope acer will use better processors for next lineup of TVs. Except the processor, everything is good and the product is recommendable.",POSITIVE
"The Acer 40-inch Smart Full HD TV is an impressive addition to any home entertainment setup. With its sleek design and vibrant display, it truly elevates the viewing experience. The Full HD resolution delivers stunning clarity and color depth, making movies, sports, and games come alive with detail.  The smart features are a standout, providing seamless access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. The user interface is intuitive, allowing for easy navigation and quick access to your favorite apps. Additionally, the built-in Wi-Fi ensures stable connectivity, enabling smooth streaming without interruptions.  Sound quality is equally commendable, with clear audio that enhances the overall experience. The TV also offers multiple HDMI and USB ports, making it easy to connect various devices, from gaming consoles to soundbars.  Overall, the Acer 40-inch Smart Full HD TV combines quality performance with user-friendly features, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment experience. Highly recommended for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike!",POSITIVE
"Putting this review after almost a month of usage. Picture quality and streaming quality is good. Display colour and sound also great. But lagging in performance, bluetooth remote sometimes not working, and only works through IR mode. Surfing between apps is still a bad experience. Viewing files in the pendrive is so much difficult. Even a 720p video can't be played smoothly when it's on my pendrive, but streaming a 1080p video through ott apps still works smoother. User interface is good, adjusting screen brightness, making some changes in the settings during an app usage is better than MI TVs. On an average It's good for the pricing, but it's not promising the specifications mentioned by the company, Acer should improve these things in the upcoming updates.",NEGATIVE
The acer I pro 43 inch 4k tv has very nice picture quality. There is minor lag in settings. Other then that UI is very smooth. My only problem is with the video playback from external hard disk. The inbuilt media player keep crashing while play 4k movies. some time takes too much time to load videos from hard disk and also sometimes it got stuck while fast forwarding. The issue doesn't solve with other media player. Nova player works fine in this tv but doesn't support HDR . The MX plays can play HDR videos but keeps freezing in this. (Both player works fine with my mi box 4k). I purchased this tv hoping the newer processor in this model will be more powerful but that's not the case. Or it may be it is some optimization problem. Otherwise tha picture quality is very good while playing online videos.,NEGATIVE
"Today, I received my Acer I Pro 55-inch TV, and after watching it, I want to share my review with all of you. This review will focus on my experience with the VA panel TV.  After watching multiple reviews on YouTube, I bought this TV, but I am very disappointed with those YouTubers. While they highlighted many positive aspects of the TV, they did not properly explain the limitations of the VA panel.  Here’s the issue: VA panels lose color accuracy when viewed from angles beyond 20 degrees. These panels are excellent if you’re viewing the TV directly from the front, where they provide 100% color accuracy. However, as soon as you change your viewing angle, you will notice significant color distortion. The picture begins to fade, and if your seating position changes to 30 to 40 degrees, the colors look completely washed out, and the picture loses its vibrancy.  Based on my experience, I strongly suggest that before purchasing a large-screen TV, visit a store and compare VA panels TV with IPS panels TV, especially on SD channels, which many of us watch daily. This will help you make a more informed decision.",NEGATIVE
"This TV offers excellent picture quality with vibrant colors and sharp 4K resolution. Sound is also clear .The smart features are intuitive, with a responsive interface but a limited app store due to the OS. Its sleek design and ample connectivity options are also strong points. it's a solid choice for those seeking a high-quality TV at a reasonable price. Would recommend, especially for casual viewers.",POSITIVE
I have been using this tv since last 3 months and its the best tv anyone can consider at this price range with best 4k gaming features and quality output. It provides great colour and audio quality is also perfect over all sound effects - consist with good function and all expected and used ports - vidaa os is very smooth and with updates i think will provide better options - brightness over 70% feels very adequate and perfect  overall can be considered as the best 4k gaming tv with good refresh rate in budget range of 50-60k,POSITIVE
"Only thing that this tv lacked was the OS(not google/android). But after 3 months I think hisense own OS ""Vida"" is way faster,snappy. Casting your laptop or android phone has no lag. Also has airplay.  Specs are near perfect [in Q3/2024]. Speakers 40wt is good enough. I rarely turn on my home theater unless I neeed that Booom in my living room. Sound is enough to fill a big indian living room.  Only negative: google has more apps. Vida is adding apps but they need pick up some pace. They have all the basic apps you would need. You can run any video audio format via usb. No need to install video players. In jan 2025 these apps as available: Netflix,youtube, disneyplus, prime, sony, zee5, apply, crunchy roll, jio cinema, yupptv.  Most of the other are not for India region. No VPN app that I could find.  Conclusion: worth your money, perfect specs, needs more india based apps, no issues with PS5 or Ps4.",POSITIVE
"This is my second Hisense TV purchase, and I am very pleased once again. The picture quality is excellent. The sound quality is impressive considering the slim build of the TV; the subwoofer is decent, providing enough bass, though it doesn’t quite match the depth of a dedicated subwoofer. So you'll have to go for external speakers if you want that extra thump.  This TV has a lot of features, many of which I haven't tested yet. The Vidaa OS operates smoothly, but the downside with it not being an android/Google TV is the limited availability of apps. I'm a Spotify subscriber and I often listen to music on my old Hisense android tv which seamlessly connects with spotify, but this TV doesn't, which is disappointing. And if you have a Hotstar Premium subscription, you won’t be able to watch content in 4K on this TV for some reason, it only goes upto 1080p. However, I have paired this TV with a Jio STB, so I don't rely on the built-in apps much.  Overall, it’s a very good TV if you primarily want to enjoy your TV channels and some OTT apps.  I'd give it a solid 4.5/5 ⭐",POSITIVE
"I owned a Hisense Television which I was really happy with, and that encouraged me to choose Hisense while I was looking for a bigger size. And with all honesty, I can say that this one's even better. Picture, Sound, Built, even the viewing angles are excellent. Perfect TV at justifyable price",POSITIVE
"The Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers an excellent combination of performance, features, and value. With a large 65-inch screen, it delivers crisp 4K resolution, vibrant colors, and decent contrast. The picture quality is solid for the price, making it a great choice for those who want an affordable yet high-performing TV for watching movies, TV shows, or gaming.  The smart features are intuitive and easy to use, thanks to its Android TV platform, which provides access to a wide variety of streaming services, apps, and built-in voice control with Google Assistant. The TV supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, offering an enhanced viewing experience with deeper blacks and brighter highlights.  In terms of design, the Hisense 65-inch TV has a sleek and modern look, with slim bezels that allow for a more immersive viewing experience. The sound quality is decent, but for an enhanced audio experience, pairing it with an external soundbar or home theater system might be a good idea.  Connectivity options are solid, with multiple HDMI ports, USB inputs, and Wi-Fi support, making it easy to hook up your devices.  Overall, the Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers impressive value for its price, delivering great picture quality, user-friendly smart features, and a modern design. It’s a solid option for anyone looking for a large, budget-friendly smart TV.",POSITIVE
Im super impressed by this tv. Amazing quality crisp sound and video. Lets hope it has longetivity! For now definetly worth every rupee,POSITIVE
"Bought this Q7N Tornado in August 2024. Review after 4 months :- Problem : bright colors causes eye strain. I even tried cinema mode, film maker mode, energy saving mode, standard mode of video but the eyes pain / eyes feel tired after watching the TV from 10-12 feet distance for 1 to 2 hours.  Benefits: Very good picture quality and clarity. 4k is very nice but too bright. Sound quality is very good nothing negative there. Connectivity options are good hdmi, usb, Bluetooth WiFi all connect very well. Vida OS is awesome no lag so far and I need only few apps like Netflix, prime, YouTube, hotstar ,zee5, sonyliv. All these apps are sufficient.  Since the screen is smooth, if you have tubelight or light or window directly opposite face to the TV then you see the reflection/glare of that tubelight or window sun light. Need to make the room darker by curtains or off the tubelight to remove its glare. I wish the screen was with matt anti-glare finishing.  Atleast I hope the company puts out some video settings recommendations to reduce eye strain for watching this TV. My old Samsung LCD 32 inch screen was better and caused no eye strain.",POSITIVE
good quality for a good price,POSITIVE
"Multiple options of audio/video input/output. I can connect my Bluetooth headphones to it. Picture quality is great. Can control with phone via App. Some was saying that it is a bit slow to respond, I don't feel so. View angles are great, colour stays same at any direction. It's worth it money. Using it for 5 months so far.",POSITIVE
"BEST VALUE FOR MONEY, KEPT SEARCHING FOR 6 MONTHS, AND WHEN I PURCHASED IT, I WAS SO SCARED TO REGRET IT!  AND NOW AFTER COUPLE OF MONTHS I CAN CONFIRM I DID NOT REGRET IT! I USE IT ONLY TO WATCH CARTOON FOR KIDS AND ME STREAMING. I HAVE A CHROME CAST, BUT NO LONGER USING IT THE SOFTWARE IS STABLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME USE IT DIRECTLY AND NO CHROME CAST LIKE MY OLD TV  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,",NEGATIVE
"It's worth the price, i realy like this TV E7k 55""!!!picture quality,the tv speaker,for gaming ps5 with 60hz native.hiw fast to navigate on the homescreen.like they say, i recommend this TV with good features that will not break the bank.. But if you have budget for qled like this with 144hz go for it. But for me, from my 7 y/o LG 59"" its a great upgrade and i am satisfied with this TV.",POSITIVE

"Last month I purchased this 55-inch QLED Vu Masterpiece 2025. The TV was delivered on time and installed as scheduled without any issues. After using it for a month, I am very impressed with its performance. Picture quality is sharp, with vibrant colors and deep contrast that really enhance the viewing experience. Sound is clear and immersive, making it great for movies and shows. Overall, this TV offers great value for the price, and I’m very happy with the purchase. Highly recommended !!",POSITIVE
"If you are looking out for premium picture and sound quality, with the convenience of superior customer service, please look no further. The Vu Masterpiece has all what it takes to blow your mind and ears with its impeccable IPS panel quality, 800 nits brightness with 144 Hz Refresh Rate and all the benefits of Google TV. The audio performance is out of the world and you won't need a Dolby Atmos soudbar as the TV comes with 7 channel sound output. A no brainer at this price. Looks and feels extremely premium too.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this TV, and I am very impressed with its performance! The picture quality is sharp, with vibrant colors and deep contrast that really enhance the viewing experience. The sound is clear and immersive, making it great for movies and gaming. Setting it up was easy, and the user interface is smooth and responsive. Overall, this TV offers great value for the price, and I’m very happy with the purchase. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Updated : (21/11/2023) : Finally VU has taken the TV for repair and they took 40 days in total and replaced the TV and sent it back. Working fine so far.  They did it within 20k including 2yrs warranty. This price is not bad. When we compare this experience with other brands(from friends), VU has an edge.  Overall, Their response it good especially manager 'Satish'(Hyd). Thanks VU for fixing the issue. It would be better if you can provide temporary TV when you take defective TV for repair. As per this experience, increasing the rating.  Updated Review:  Earlier I have given 5 start rating and asked friends to purchase this TV. They purchased 2 TVs of 65 inches. But now regret it and reduced rating to 2 star. Because:  Immediately after 1 year of usage, TV screen got blurred and bluish. Called customer care. They said warranty is over and I need pay 1500 for just technician visit. It is insane that, for just a visit they are charging 1500. That technician came with only one screw driver and I am shocked that even he don't carry multimeter. He just opened TV and checked only bus cables and declared that pannel should be replaced and it would cost 30 to 40 thousand. He never bothered to check exactly what happened to the TV and where the shorting was happened. He doesn't have technical knowledge and they charge 1500 rupees for this visit. And he local guy.  For 1 year old TV, that too for manufacturing defect, VU doesn't take responsibility and get it repaired. They will charge 70 percentage of TV cost to replace the panel.  After sales service is pathetic for VU TVs. Please be aware of it.  --------OLD REViEW------- This top quality premium TV acailable in reasonable price. We have see all high end features in it. Forget about picture quality. You will love it. It has premium look and beautiful. Sound is excellent and it is enough for most of the people. But sound bar or external speakers needed if you love exceptional sound. Some users reported some issues when we play movies with subtitles. But I don't see such issues. It is perfect premium TV. We can play games also with Android aupported game pads. I played couple of games with gamepad. They are good. Remote is perfect. They have given wall mount kit. Just blindly go for it...",POSITIVE
Pros Picture quality Sound output Ergonomics Build quality Responsiveness  Cons Nothing as of now,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the VU Masterpiece 55-inch TV, and I am beyond impressed! The screen quality is absolutely stunning—the 4K resolution delivers crystal-clear visuals, vibrant colors, and deep contrasts that make every scene come to life. Whether it's movies, sports, or gaming, the viewing experience is truly immersive.  The UI is fast and incredibly smooth, with apps launching quickly and navigation feeling seamless. The TV's interface is user-friendly and responsive, making it a joy to explore content without any frustrating lags.  Another standout feature is the excellent viewing angles. No matter where you're seated in the room, the picture remains sharp and consistent, which is perfect for family movie nights or gatherings with friends.  Overall, the VU Masterpiece 55-inch TV is a fantastic choice that combines performance, style, and innovation. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a premium home entertainment upgrade!",POSITIVE
"After viewing experience one month later, I will must say awesome Build quality which is bazel less design and armani gold color, and google voice recognition is great work, functionality is great 3 gb 32 gb which is great to comparison to other brand TV👍 sound like a home theatre 100 watt subwoofers. I think much better quality compare to other brand TV, Color quality superb, HDR 10+ which is great experience to Netflix content, 4k content is superb, And very smoothly working remote and also easy to installation experience. My wife wanted to buy samsung QLED 65"" But i decided to VU Masterpiece 55"" Something new brand... But after watching the tv we are very satisfied. Thank you VU MASTERPIECE TV. And Thank you AMAZON.IN to make me A Happy's 😄",POSITIVE
One of the best you can get at this price. Good picture quality and AI upscaling. Sound is like from home theatre.  Cons Only 1year warranty TV cannot play MP4.. its a big miss for me. I could not play video from my DJI drone. Installation.. Team never turned.. done myself. TV may deliver in 1 or 2 days. But installation team take their sweet time.,POSITIVE
"Though costly but its an excellent TV with premium features. After all its Sony! Stunning picture quality and clear sound. I am yet to see IMAX enhanced movie on this TV but saw demo on Sony Pictures Core which was superb! Recommend to attach it with a premium Dolby Atmos, DTS-X sounnbar.",POSITIVE
"The Sony Bravia 7 (55”) looks quite amazing . The picture and sound is mind blowing. The delivery was quick (from amazon) and Demo & installation was good (took 3 days ), special thanks to Mr Mahesh for helping out in installation.",POSITIVE
Mukesh and Ramesh were superbly handled the installation of the tv and TV is extremely good nothing much to add.,NEGATIVE
"Its an aesthetically looking TV and amazing picture quality.Then sound is also fantastic. I must say that even though there was no base stand(table) provided in the box, Sony representative came and fitted that without any additional cost.They will charge extra only for wall mount. Man the HDR contents are mind blowing and nothing beats the color representation as Sony does.",POSITIVE
"Received a defective and damaged product. The box was completely damaged, it was not expected from amazon side.",NEGATIVE
Very helpful and polite installation and demo was helpful as well. Got home theater demo as well and was mind blown,NEGATIVE
"Loved it,  Delivered product came in one piece. Installation was done smoothly for me. Bravia core app - almost free movies in 4K. Except some new ones, I guess. I haven’t experienced lag or latency while browsing though apps. Lot of options in settings, you can explore those. I’m not sure why there isn’t microphone option for quick search.",POSITIVE
"I ordered this tv thinking rtings review were probably overdoing reflection and viewing angle. At offline stores viewing angle appeared ok, a bit washed out on sides, but I thought there itnwould be ok at home. Smooth delivery and installation. Great tv in night. Very very poor in daytime. There are windows on side of tv, but you need to block all sunlight to better front on viewing experience compared to my 9 year old samsung led. And side viewing is quite sad. Unfortunately we don't have return windows loke in USA, so saddled with this tv. At thus price category, S90D was cheaper and infinitely better. Should have listened to the dealer. If you do meed to buy sony, go with X90L. The sound of bravia 7 is average and not worth upgrade.",NEGATIVE
"Superb quality and excellent features  My Samsung Frame TV (Matt Finish)  The first thing I like is to have our customizable Photos / Paintings as a Frame and It looks like a real.  The picture quality is far better than I expected and is fully customizable to suit your room, even though it can adjust itself automatically depending on the darkness of the room, time of day etc.  The sound quality through the TV is excellent but I opted to add the Samsung Sound Bar with sourrended speakers for some really immersive viewing.  The one thing that I really like is that there’s just 1 thin cable from the TV, which plugs into the hub.  Features again are superb and there are loads of options to set up your TV exactly as you want it.  Finally, value for money? Yes most definitely in my opinion. I have an excellent TV, with the features, quality, and price I wanted, which I think is definitely value for money for a quality product like this.",POSITIVE
Qlty good sound qlty good eassy we installed it happy to buy. Picture qlty good 4k qlty good. As per price vallue good,POSITIVE
"This 2024 4k qled may be slightly better than a regular 4k LED tv.  Picture quality is good. Colour reproduction is uniform and consistent. But audio is cheap, Dolby audio is good but you would need to connect a soundbar.  HDR performance is good. Not great due to average brightness of the panel, peaks around 450nits.  No VRR. Watching Sports is normal like a regular 50Hz TV. For smoother sports action might consider different TV with120Hz or higher refresh rate.  Screen is reflective, so need to take some measures for direct light glares. Design is slim and looks premium. Minimal bezel. Build quality is good.  Accessibility of the port will be a major issue if you are planning to wall mount. Purchase a movable telescopic wall mount, some extra cost for ease of access and cleaning. Installation was within 24 hours. Remote is the highlight. Tiny and handy.  Tizen OS is light but not so snappy. App store is not so great, but you get most of the popular OTT. Could not locate samsung game hub support in this.  Edit: Sometimes I noticed clouding in non-HDR dark scenes. It may be due to edgelit LED in this tv, which cannot produce local dimming as you could get in a backlit panel.",NEGATIVE
"This is a review almost after one year of using the product. Great picture quality. But after the software update in October, the software has become really buggy and a hassle to use the TV. Everytime I switch on the TV, the brightness becomes completely low. The universal remote is so buggy that everytime I switch on the TV, the set top box would switch off. Now I have turned off the universal remote feature and that’s not happening. But the technicians are not able to understand that. Have communicated multiple times that these two issues have come up after the software update but they don’t even listen to me. Tired of changing the brightness setting every single time I turn on the TV. Been waiting for a software update since October 2023 but that is also not happening. Wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy this product and go through this effort. Not worth it.",NEGATIVE
I have been using this tv for almost a year now and I can certainly say that it one of the best smart tvs available in the market. I was sceptical initially about the picture quality comparing the other tv available in the market. But after using it for this long I am very happy with the picture quality. Built in speakers a way better than the other tvs in this range. It gives proper thump and crisp sound. At last talking about the best feature which is being a frame tv it looks super cool and whenever someone is coming to your house they are definitely going to talk about the tv. It stands out from the rest.,POSITIVE
"I am writing this review after using for 3 days.  I have watched - Movie and IND vs AUS live match in OTT apps: Video and audio quality is too good. - Watched latest video songs on YouTube app: Video quality and audio quality is too good. - Watched SD channel in DTH: SD channel is handled perfectly. I don't see any blur nees and video quality loss. Don't see colors banding, Video sharpness is also perfectly handled. - Watched HD channels in DTH: No need say. Quality is too good. - Watched 4K content from YouTube: Quality is too good.  Pleasure watching my all time favorite movie THOLIPREMA (1998) in this TV. Amazed with video quality, image sharpness and audio quality considering old movie.  Design: - Almost Baseless TV - Thin TV. Just like a frame. - Simple remote. But all controls has it. - Can charge remote with Solar and USB type C.  Delivery and installation: - Received TV in 1 day. - Installation done on next day.  Features: - Connected to smart things app. - From app, we can control TV with virtual remote. - TV turn on/ off also controlled with app.  I thought of buying Samsung Frame 2022 55 inches TV. But in offer sales I didn't get better deal.  I am happy with Samsung QLED 2023 55 inch TV. I strongly recommend this TV.",POSITIVE
"Cons: 1)It's expensive. 2)You have to buy a frame/bezel separately(3k-9k) 3)One Connect Box has to be stored or hidden somewhere & buy accessories to attach other devices 4)Software, yes it laggs (do proper switch off/on & it will be fine)  Is it worth buying? YES, DEFINITELY. 1) ART, ART & ART 2) Matte screen: Anti-glare, low gloss finish that handles reflections well ( IN DAY LIGHT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN A REALLY ART) 3) Picture quality & Design 4) Practical remote(no cells required, you have to charge it)",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Amazon Fire Stick Lite, and it’s been a great addition to my entertainment setup. For its price, this Lite edition offers almost everything you need to enjoy streaming on platforms like Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, and YouTube without breaking the bank.  The setup process was quick and easy, and the interface is smooth and responsive. Although it doesn’t support 4K streaming, the HD quality is clear and consistent, perfect for anyone with a standard TV. The Alexa voice remote is a nice touch, allowing me to search for content and control playback without much hassle.  For the price I paid, this device delivers excellent value for money. While it lacks some advanced features like volume and power control found in the regular Fire Stick, it’s perfect if you’re looking for an affordable streaming device to transform a regular TV into a smart one. Highly recommend the Fire Stick Lite for anyone on a budget!",POSITIVE
I am owning a Sony Bravia tv that is old and I wanted to make that a smart tv firestick is the best gadget that I can find for that the internet speeds are good picture quality is also good my money is worth spending here as it saves a lots of money but if you don't have any kind of subscriptions your experience would be very bad and the youtube on tv is a big nightmare without premium as it shows very long and frequent ads but I am happy from the product,POSITIVE
"No doubt that Amazon FireTV Stick LITE is a great product 👍🏻, since it is very affordable, easily setup, intuitive interface, up and running 🏃🏻 without any mandatory 🔗 subscriptions, great quality WiFi receiver 📶 etc.  One can easily go through this product's own feature-list 📰, and also go though many praises in user reviews 📝. Amazon's FireTV Stick Developers did a great job. Hats 🤠 off to the team.  However 🤔, within 2-3 weeks of use, I did stumble upon a few short comings which are worth noting to be fair ⚖️. These are:  👉🏻 Not Android apps Library: FireTV has its own OS. So all the Android apps that you find on your Mobile's Google Play Store are not magically available for FireTV. ✨ I wish FireTV had an easy way for the app developers to port their apps from Android OS to FireTV OS.  👉🏻 Resolution Scaling: Even if FireTV LITE is HD, and your TV is HD, since you desire to make your old TV smart, chances are that there's an aspect ratio mismatch. A picture 🖼️ is worth a thousand words, so I am simply demonstrating it in the attached 📎 pic. and leaving it to your understanding. ✨ I wish that there was no resolution scaling resulting in Full HD experience to all Full HD TV owners.  👉🏻 WiFi-Network Switching not Seamless: If you have two WiFis 📶📶, or more practically speaking 🙊, one 1️⃣ Home-WiFi and second 2️⃣ Mobile-Hotspot. Now, in case, your Home-WiFi goes down and within a few seconds you switch-ON the Mobile-Hotspot, you'll find yourself waiting ⌛ and hoping 🙏🏻 that the FireTV OS switches to the available Hotspot in time. ✨ I wish that the WiFi-Network switching was Seamless and Quick. UPDATE Sep-2024: I have been noticing significant improvement and the switchover is pretty smooth these days  👉🏻 Many Suggested Apps not yet India 🇮🇳🛺 Ready: Amongst top 20 or so entertainment (TV shows) apps that FireTV interface suggested me, and after installing 2-3 of those, I found 🧐 that those were simply not allowing me to watch the content - as if those apps were blocking the content by country's IP - may be those work fine in the USA 🇺🇲🗽. ✨ I wish that such apps clearly indicate the reason for not showing the content, and are filtered out for India by default.  👉🏻 Home Screen personalization has a lot of Scope for Improvement: After viewing/using a couple or so apps much more frequently than other apps, the 1st row of home 🏡 screen 🖥️ always displays the same apps as defined by Amazon. Also, 50% of the Home Screen real estate is occupied by advertisements. ✨ I wish that the advertisements on the home screen occupied less space, and the 1st row of home screen apps prioritised my recent+most-used apps.  👉🏻 Remote too Fragile: ✨ I wish that the outer material used for the remote was somewhat more shatter-proof 🔨🚫 material, and the outer corners ↖️↗️ had some rubber/silicon padding.  👉🏻 Expensive Remote Replacement: Upon searching 🔎 on Amazon itself for the FireTV's spare remote, so far I only found 3rd party (after market) products. While the cost of old TV remotes start at around ₹300 or so, and AC remotes with LCD display start at around ₹400, FireTV Stick LITE replacement remotes start at around ₹1,500. ✨ I wish that it was possible to buy replacement remotes from Amazon itself, and at a reasonable price - even if Amazon wants to verify the customer as past FireTV buyer. UPDATE Sep-2024: I have been noticing Geniune Amazon FireTV spare remote available these days, so it is no longer a problem.  👉🏻 FireTV Stick Mobile app Quality: The quality of Mobile 📱 app of FireTV Stick app is so basic that you would wish that it was never available in the first place. ✨ I wish that at minimum, the app provides a touch 'n tap functionality for a pointer navigation on the TV since using arrow-keys on the remote is too cumbersome. In addition, it would be great if the Mobile app made it possible to search and install FireTV Stick apps - categorised in a Google Play Store style.  For the above shortcomings, I am withholding only 1-star, and generously awarding 4-stars to FiteTV Stick LITE ⭐🌟⭐🌟.  Finally, here are some tips, which I hope the users would find useful:  💡 TIP: I find HDMI Port always ON as long as TVs power cord is plugged-in and switched-ON, even when the TV is switched OFF from the remote. Also, I am guessing that most of the users might be leaving the USB adaptor switched ON at the same time. Eventually the FireTV Stick LITE is going to have a shorter life. Please plan on switching OFF the TV and the FireTV USB adaptor each time you are not viewing the TV.  💡 TIP: Ease of Installation at the Cost of some Security Risk. Not so long ago, the WiFi/login details of some customers of a home security camera of a popular brand (Google it and you'll be shocked) were misused by handful of employees of the manufacturer. Eventually those employees were fired. The lesson learnt is that never over-trust company servers to store passwords/credentials that they are not meant to - and remember those passwords by heart.  💡 TIP: If the Speaker Sound Quality of the old TV doesn't feel satisfactory, one can always connect a separate Bluetooth Speaker to FireTV Stick LITE.  💡 TIP: FireTV Stick LITE also allows many other compatible Bluetooth devices to be connected. For example you can connect a Bluetooth Mouse, and have an enhanced experience with many apps.  💡 TIP: Flexible, Shock-absorbant Remote Covers with Strap are available on Amazon - will prove to be good protection ☂️ for this investment.  💡 TIP: Always follow on-screen and/or printed instructions 📃 provided with the FireTV Stick, instead of following any 3rd person 🦜 with possibly outdated or inaccurate instructions.",NEGATIVE

"Today i purchased the 50-inch Wooble QLED TV, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The picture quality is simply stunning—sharp, vibrant colors and deep contrasts make watching movies or shows a truly immersive experience. Whether it's HD or 4K content, the visuals are crisp and crystal clear, doing full justice to the QLED technology.  The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering rich, full-bodied audio that complements the visual experience. I didn't need any external speakers as the in-built sound system offers a well-balanced range of highs and lows, making it perfect for everything from action-packed films to quiet dialogues.  The design of the TV is another highlight—sleek, modern, and minimalist. It seamlessly blends into any room, and the slim bezels ensure that your focus is always on the screen. It’s a stylish addition to my living room, and the overall build quality feels premium.  Lastly, I want to commend the delivery service. The TV arrived on time, exactly as promised, in perfect condition. The packaging was secure, and the setup process was hassle-free.  Overall, Wooble has done an outstanding job with this QLED TV. For a Made-in-India brand, it competes with international brands in terms of both performance and design. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Remote buttons have poor response - after 3 to 5 press of button, it mostly responds once - the hassles to the user is enormous. However, Amazon policy does not allow replacement of only remote. Either return the product in totality or live with the problematic accessories. So, after taking out from the box and then installation taking about 4 to 5 hours, customer will have to undo all and then re-pack. What a punishment for the customer! Please surely to be carefull while buing any consumer durable from Amazon. 2. Wall mounting kit is actually a clamp to hang the TV and no tilting to change viewing angle is possible. The word ""kit"" is a misnomer. 3. Picture quality is more or less OK; colour response and contrast are poor",NEGATIVE
Nice product picture quality is good sound is good make in india product,POSITIVE
Audio quality is truly horrible 😔,NEGATIVE
Good quality nice product faster installation paisa vasul,POSITIVE
Poor Sound Quality and Picture Clarity. HD version is better this QLED version. My suggestions is not go for it. Waste of Money.,NEGATIVE

Overall, it's a great choice for anyone looking for a premium yet affordable TV. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Toshiba 55-inch TV and I must say, I am extremely impressed with the overall performance and quality of this product.

The sound quality is also top-notch, providing clear and crisp audio that enhances the viewing experience.  I appreciate the sleek and modern design of it ,which looks great in my living room and adds a touch of elegance to the space. The setup was quick and easy, and the user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it a breeze to navigate through different settings and apps.

I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a high-quality viewing experience at an affordable price. Thank you, Toshiba, for delivering such a fantastic product!",POSITIVE
Giveing review after 1 month of use Pros- Overally video and audio Clearity is awesome. Value for money. Cons- In high moving object like while watching cricket observe when ball moves faster it gets blur some time it's seems 2-3 ball are moves faster back to back like that. In short MEMC not provided or not working properly. But it's not big issue,POSITIVE
"The performance of the Toshiba TV is excellent! The picture quality is vibrant, the sound is crisp, and the overall experience has been great. However, the installation process could have been better. While the setup was completed, one side of the TV is slightly tilted down, which was a bit disappointing.  Despite this minor issue, the TV itself delivers an outstanding viewing experience, and I’m very satisfied with the product. Highly recommend it for its performance!",POSITIVE
"The TV is awsome, very nice picture quality and dolby atmos is too good. At this price point you can't ask for more. Yes in comparison to all Android tv this is a bit slow but faster than the rest.  Important part- I read many negative comments or reviews regarding installation failure. The same happened with me, however with constant communication with Amazon they helped me to get the tv installed within the scheduled time. Yes if you are polite enough anyone will help you out.  There are reviews regarding the tv shutting down itself after some time. The same thing happened with me. But it's a energy saving feature of the TV, if you keep it in idle condition it will shutdown. That is a good feature. But illeterate consumers doesn't understand nor study the manual before posting such reviews. It's an awsome tv go for it",NEGATIVE
"TV is a good buy at this price point. Picture quality could have been better, sound is clear and loud. Overall a nice tv.",POSITIVE
"Positives: overall good performance, 2 years of warranty.  Negatives: White light bleeding at the edges of screen very clearly visible in grey screen.",NEGATIVE

"I recently purchased the Hisense TV, and it has exceeded all my expectations. It’s the best TV I could find within my budget, offering a perfect combination of quality, features, and affordability.

The smart TV features work well, and the interface is user-friendly.  The design is straightforward, and the TV looks decent in my living room. The sound quality is average, but it gets the job done.  Overall, I'd say this TV offers good value for money.

Currently everything is working fine. Overall visualisation is good andColours are sharp. Good clarity. Sound quality is clear loud and decent. Dark scenes are not that impressive but can be adjust accordingly. Only concern which I am worried about is Build design and Quality. There are no side boarders covered the display. By any chance in future by heating issues or some other issues the attached glue lost its ability to stick then the situation is unpredictable. So consider this and think about it.  Overall experience is Good 👍,POSITIVE
"Everything is working fine. Colours are sharp. Good clarity. Remote response is fast. Sound is clear loud and decent. Dark scenes are not that impressive but can be adjust accordingly. Only thing which I am worried about is the construction of the screen/display. In the picture can easily see the display is not inside the frame or covered with the borders, it’s 3 side open and pasted on some kind of foam for flexibility. Only the bottom of the screen is covered with a strip. Sharing this because never see this kind of screen construction.",POSITIVE
"Hisense TV, model **108 cm (43 inches) E6N Series 4K Ultra HD Smart**, is a great option for those looking for quality at an affordable price.

I got the tv in offer in less price and in the price range I am satisfied with the purchase. Picture quality is superb and sound is also good. Sometimes it lags but not always. Overall good product.,POSITIVE
"Image quality is great, I was impressed by the audio options, very clear and not muffled like usually it is on this price range tv’s. Software is good and aesthetic, but it’s a bit buggy with Airplay. Recommend for the budget range.",NEGATIVE
This is not a Google TV!,NEGATIVE
"I am realistic and I don't know what I should be expecting for a 500€ TV But the backlight bleed is pretty awful around all the edges, at least it bleeds uniformly xD  I use flux (justgetflux) to protect my eyes (it's like reader mode on steroids) and skin color turns green, it does a lot of funky things that my laptop (20cm away) doesn't. Yes I am sitting 1 meter away from the TV  I had to play with the color setting and does absolutely nothing, even without the caveman mode that I use to protect my eyes, the colors are very washed, but it does the job, I was just looking for cheap screen real estate and I got it, don't expect anything else.  The 144hz is a complete scam by the way",NEGATIVE
Its a great television and we are loving it. The only grudge that we have is that the installation service person took Rs 3000 extra for wall mount. Even though it was told to me that wall mount is included.,POSITIVE
"As seen from other reviews, and my very own review , this Tv has Electrical issue, my whole screen has become Blurred after purchasing, the screen in non functional after 5 days of installation , only the audio and TV is functioning in the backgroud, but Picture is gone, fully cloudy, Seems samsung had reduced its quality, i already do have a flagship Q80T (2020) but never faced this sort of issue, hope samsung brings some changes in the future , instead of cheating indian customers. TV buying date March 2024, TV model year: 2022 , i have bought with almost 40% off, since this is a 1 year old model , and i feel very disappointed .",NEGATIVE
"Tv is terrific,one connect box really makes everything convenient for all connectivity options and hassle free wire management. Picture quality equivalent to a expensive oled tv with greater brightness if u have a brighter room. In last my cordial thanks to Amazon for swift delivery and installation.",POSITIVE
In other countries the same TV comes with 2 remotes and 2 one connect cable. In india Samsung is charging so much but not providing 2 cables. Even the manual says 2 cables should be there but samsung still ships 1 cable. How can you expect the back of the TV with a long one connect cable. Why I am spending lake's of rupees on this TV. Picture is definately bood apart from some video issues when the screen looks wavy . Sound is pathetic. Please buy from some brand who provide all promised accessories,NEGATIVE
"I have seen many people post review about. Display flickering or audio being too flat on the tv. From what I understand. This issue was common in old days with LCD planels. Because of either frequency fluctuations or electricals being plugged into the plug that doesn't have proper earthing.  Since QLED is nothing but LCD panel is Quantum dot layer is also has similar properties as LCD back in the day. Instead of blaming the product it would be better if you consider issue being in other places.  I have seen similar reviews for Samsung soundbar showing offline in smart things App. In that case there was no issue with soundbar but because many people have cheap wifi router which randomly switches frequency to accomodate large number of wifi connection. Switching to better router or using mesh system of router fixed it as well.  There are only 4, 5 reviews on this item on amazon while 2 of 1 star reviews are given by same person. In an attempt to get attention & refund. I think @shri.... It would be better if you do some reasearch before you buy such expensive item. before posting reviews the misleads others.",NEGATIVE
"Samsung tv is not worth buying, 6months ago we purchased samsung Neo Q Led 55inc (QN85B) and slowly we noticed screen flickering and happened to raise technical issue with service centre. They visited our home but there wasn’t any action taken. It’s been 45 days til today issue wasn’t resolved and we have to follow up with customer service every single day. All they tell us was that they raised ticket to replace part but till haven’t done yet. Now finally they are telling that part is not available and would refund the amount. God knows how long this might take now 🙏. All I want to tell is , please don’t fall in trap in buying Samsung TVs or premium TVs and words like elite TV. Note we purchased the tv from Bajaj electronics.",NEGATIVE
Contrast is almost equal to oled tv but the brightness will blow your mind. Its a premium segment tv hence the price is on higher side but picture quality and sound is at another level.,NEGATIVE
Screen flickering issue within 6 months and Samsung service is vary bad. Never buy any expensive TV's form Samsung. Note: i have bought it in Reliance Digi store and not in Amazon.,NEGATIVE
"I recently upgraded to the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV, and I’m quite impressed by what it delivers at its price point. Here’s my personal take:  Picture Quality:  The 4K resolution with Dolby Vision really stands out. Watching UHD content is a treat, with vibrant colors and clear details, especially in brighter scenes. However, when streaming SDR content or older shows, you might notice some graininess, especially on larger screens like the 65-inch model. Adjusting the backlight and saturation can help if you prefer more natural tones, as the default settings can be a bit too vivid for my taste.  Sound:  The 30W speakers are surprisingly good for regular TV viewing, supporting Dolby Audio and DTS. For everyday use, they’re loud and clear enough, but I found the bass to be lacking, so if you're a fan of deep, immersive sound, investing in a soundbar might be a good idea.  User Interface:  Google TV is easy to navigate, and I love how it suggests shows and movies across platforms based on my viewing habits. Plus, Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature is a great addition, giving access to over 200 live channels without extra subscriptions. Switching between apps is generally smooth, though I noticed slight lag after prolonged use, but it’s nothing that impacts the overall experience too much.  Design:  The sleek black design with thin bezels looks great in any room. I opted to mount mine on the wall, which I think suits the larger models better as they can take up a lot of space on a stand. It's not a premium build, but it’s sturdy and fits well with modern interiors.  Smoothness In terms of smoothness, the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV is decent but not flawless. The TV is powered by a quad-core A55 chipset, paired with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. For regular tasks like switching between apps, browsing, and streaming, the performance is generally smooth. However, some users have reported occasional lag, especially after prolonged use or when loading heavier apps. It's not a dealbreaker, but the experience might not be as snappy as higher-end models.  The Google TV interface is a big plus here, as it runs efficiently, with intuitive navigation and quick access to content across various platforms. Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature adds to the smoothness, with seamless integration of live TV and streaming apps into one unified experience.  For basic daily use, the smoothness is acceptable, but if you’re after a flawless, zero-lag experience, you might notice occasional slowdowns with heavy multitasking.  Final Thoughts:  Overall, the Xiaomi X Series delivers excellent value for anyone seeking a 4K TV with smart features at an affordable price. Its picture quality shines with UHD content, and the Google TV integration is intuitive. Just be prepared for some occasional performance hiccups and consider adding external speakers if audio quality is a priority for you.",POSITIVE
"Very good and colourful panel, deep blacks, moderate viewing angles. Metal back feels solid. Speaker is also lound and clear. One con is that TV sometimes get slow and ui frames caps to like 30 hz, but it is rare. Hope this issue gets solved by update. Overall if anyone wants fabulous picture quality this should be a very good option. I got the tv at 21750 during sale, so it is value for money product",POSITIVE
"I bought it in August 2024 the packaging was good damage on executive delivered the product at my doorstep and the check the product whether it was damage or not then after 2 hours MI service centre technician called me for installation and they reach to my home within 1 hour and installed the product but I have to pay it extra 500 rupees for the Wall mount because the Wall mount was not including in the box but that is okay because the Wall mount brand is also MI, functionality of the product is good picture quality is good enough features of the product is good but the space of internal storage is not enough(only 8gb,free space is about 4gb)it should be 16GB or more for internal memory, installation was very quick and we are using the TV for last 2 month for me it's a good product I got it from Amazon at rupees of 20700 and extra 500 I paid for the Wall mount so basically it was a good deal but after that the TV was sold in great Indian festival at rupees of 17700 so I missed the opportunity to buy the product at a low price of that never mind, the product connectivity is good, picture quality was very good just go for it",NEGATIVE
As i purchase this Mi A Pro tv because of new launch and affordable price. As i can see some lag in OS as well as playing any 4k content and the internet speed was slow as i connected it through Hotspot...it was taking some time to load even though my internet speed was 300mbps and the delivery guys carelessly kept this Tv flat in their vehicle but tnx there was no damage rather then everything is good worth buying and i hope they fix some bugs in next update Quick Pros* Excellent Picture Quality Excellent Sound Build quality is good Affordable Price Worth buying  Cons* ( which i faced ) Little lag in OS & 4k content Response time is little slow Stand build quality is not good,NEGATIVE
"The worst ever sound quality. Good display but with performance lag! After a week, sound became weaker than it was in the beginning! No more option to replace the TV or replace with another brand!!",NEGATIVE
"Amazing pictures quality. . Great experience. . I got this TV in an Amazing price of 65K in prime day sale after exchange offer,coupon code and bank offer all combines. . In this price range it's a gold deal to have this product. . Writing review after 4 months. . Picture awesome. . Sound is also good but still you need sound bar. . Doesn't hang up. . 120hz refresh rate is also good smooth pictures. .",POSITIVE
"After buying 75inch TV for 1.2 lakh all the HDMI ports alone stopped working after 7 months. Since it was in warranty they tried to repair it by changing the new main board which has the HDMI ports. But remote stopped working because Bluetooth /wifi boards was not compatible with the main board. They changed to new Bluetooth board still remote was not working. They did this 3 times. Every time it takes 2 to 3 weeks to place order for new board to arrive and customer service center were silent. I had to folowup continuously every 3 days for 4 months but whatever board they change either one only works, if HDMI port works remote doesn't work and viceverse. They kept trying again and again. Then i escalated to till CEO, requested for replacement of whole new TV from the beginning. But they kept trying to repair by changing boards again and again. Finally after 4th repair attempt also failed they agreed to replace complete TV. To my surprise they bought a refurbished TV with lots of scratches without accessories like Stand, remote etc. I refused to accept it and asked them to take back. I again escalated and asked for a brand New TV. Finally after 4 months they replaced with brand new TV. But in those 4 months i went into severe mental stress because of irresponsible behavior by service person and no response from Mi company side. What I found is that nothing is manufactured by Mi. All the components are manufactured by different companies , Mi just does the branding and sales and service. Example all the board's are from TCL , screen is from RoHS. Don't buy LED TV from Mi. Mi is good for mobiles.",NEGATIVE
I've been using this product since it was launched and today I can say that it has a laggy interface and sometimes remote doesn't response. Overall it's a good tv with some bug. Go for it you want to experience an immersive display.,POSITIVE
"Value for money, liked the seamless same day installation, 4k quality seems satisfactory. TV lags slightly for a few seconds just after restart, but that's fine.",POSITIVE
"Honestly wasn’t expecting much because of the price. It is great for this price, be it with regards to the picture quality, functionalities or sound quality. Installation though pretty straightforward, Amazon screwed up with their ‘Premium Installation’, absolutely pathetic!",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this tv and a faulty unit was delivered as from day 1 the tv had screen flickering issues. I raised this with Amazon and they arranged for brands support staff visit to check the issue during which the brand technician told me that there is mismatch in the serial number i.e the serial number of the tv delivered and the serial number in the invoice downloaded from Amazon app doesn't match. So no support was provided from brands side due to this issue.  I raised this concern as well with Amazon and it has been 10 days that i have been continuously connecting with Amazon support executives and absolutely no help is being provided. They keep on transferring calls to some specialised teams which doesn't have a resolution. After continuing on each call for almost 30-45 mins , the call some how gets disconnected and on reconnecting some new staff gets alloted to whom i have to explain the same story again. This loop continues. Being a Amazon prime customer there has been no support from Amazon's side whatsoever. This is my worst experience with Amazon till date. There is still no return / replacement being provided from Amazon' side , they are asking me to contact brand support for the same. All the problems are on Amazon's side but they are not taking any onus of the same.  And i am stuck with the faulty tv...",NEGATIVE
"I decided to purchase this TV despite mixed reviews, as my previous Xiaomi Full HD TV served me well for nearly six years without any issues. I opted for the 43"" model, and after using it for 10 days, my overall impression is mixed.  The TV isn’t bad, but be prepared to invest in external speakers for a better audio experience. I’m using a JBL 4 Bluetooth speaker connected via AUX cable, which significantly enhances the content-watching experience.  The default picture and sound modes are underwhelming, requiring considerable customization to achieve satisfactory results. A major drawback is the TV's inability to accurately handle red colors, which is disappointing regardless of the settings. Another issue is the remote, which sometimes requires a second press with a firmer touch to respond properly.  As for lag, I found that if you allow the TV to fully start up and load its processes (around 2 minutes), it runs smoothly without any performance issues.  On a positive note, the installation and service provided by Amazon were seamless and hassle-free.",NEGATIVE
Great but average quality,POSITIVE
"Purchased this tv in July 2024 and after using it for around 5 months now, I can say that it's a really good TV. After doing so much research I finalized this tv over other brands like Sony samsung lg TCL acer etc. others are offering similar features at higher price. But this tv came in just around 20.5k.  Pros: - Best picture quality - looks premium in the room - most amazing part is sound is loud, clear and balanced. Never faced audio issues like other TVs. In other TVs either music is good but not loud enough or bass is too much that you can't watch movies with clear sound. We were thinking of having speakers and hometheater but dropped that idea after having this tv as the sound is good, loud and best - installation was quick and easy - UI is really good. Never hangs even while playing Dolby vision 4k HD videos - Gets regular software updates - remote is sleek and has better button replacement than other tv remotes - customer care called me after 2 months to take my feedback about tv. Such things don't exist in today's world. Felt good that customer care actually cares  I had already used or seen mi tv(parents have one), redmi tv(brother have one), acer tv(friend has this), sony tv(cousin has this), TCL tv(another friend has this), OnePlus tv(one friend has this). , so I had experience with tvs of all these companies... They have issues like low sound, bad picture quality, software hanging, tv getting slow after a few months even if updated etc.... after enough comparisons and experience I can say that Kodak tv is best and worth the amount you spend.  Go for this tv if on low budget like me. It's worth every penny.",POSITIVE
"Awesome sturdiness, easy to use, clear pictures, odisha sound. But overall value for money",POSITIVE
"I’ve been using this budget-friendly Android TV for over a year now, and it has been a great experience overall. The picture quality has remained sharp, and the performance is consistent with smooth app functionality and minimal lag. It’s impressive how reliable this TV has been for the price!  That said, the remote has been a bit of a challenge—it stopped working properly a few months ago. Fortunately, the TV’s mobile app has been a lifesaver, offering a seamless remote control alternative.  For the price, this TV delivers excellent value, and despite the minor remote issue, I would still recommend it for anyone looking for an affordable smart TV option.",POSITIVE
"Good TV . I have been using from last 6months and no issues. Picture and sound quality is good. Easy to use Netflix, prime video you tube . And other Apps.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this TV, and it has exceeded my expectations! The picture quality is decent, the features are impressive, and it's undoubtedly the best value-for-money product in this price range. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Very Good. Worth the money. Picture clarity, sound and built quality of the Is awesome. Totally satisfied",POSITIVE
Tv is good and reasonable but wall mount we have to purchased separately and costs 3500 rs Otherwise installation team was good 👍,NEGATIVE
Good tv best buy for this money range with multiple features with good quality picture quality is normal sound clarity finds me well over all build quality can be improved with fit and finish value for money,POSITIVE
"Nice TV, sound quality, picture quality.",POSITIVE
"If you're looking for a 55-inch 4K TV with excellent picture quality, a wide range of features, and a user-friendly interface at an affordable price, I highly recommend the Xiaomi Smart TV X Pro.  Here are some of the things I love about it:  The picture quality is good. The 4K resolution, HDR10+, Dolby Vision IQ, and MEMC all work together to deliver a truly immersive viewing experience. The wide viewing angles mean that you can enjoy the same great picture quality from anywhere in the room. Google TV is a great platform but its slower than LG or Samsung, with a wide range of apps and features, including hands-free Google Assistant support it good. The sound quality is not that good but with dolby content its good, especially for a TV at this price point. The price is very affordable, especially with the credit card offer and big billion discount that I was able to take advantage of. I got this @41500 Overall, I'm very happy with the Xiaomi Smart TV X Pro 55-inch. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great value for money 55-inch 4K TV.",POSITIVE
Good,POSITIVE
"I have purchased Mi TV in March and it started giving issues within a month only. I have requested services several times but my TV is still not working properly. Now today, it started giving block & white lines then suddenly, TV stopped working & nothing is visible on the screen. I will never recommend Mi TV to anyone. Its services is very worst. Their is no number to whom we can contact regarding the issue. They just say book an appointment, engineer will visit & repair and they just disconnect the call every time. I'm too much fed up and frustrated with the TV. Neither they come & repair the TV nor they replace the same. Their engineer/technician doesn't come on time and the person named Surender Pal Rajput never speak in good way. Whenever we call him, he is in a hurry to just end up the call. My hard earned money got wasted. I'll recommend to everyone NOT TO PURCHASE XIAOMI MI TV You will surely regret one day.",NEGATIVE
"All must have features included in this TV. Good picture quality, sound, user friendly interface. Don’t buy such costly TV like other brands. Because actual life of smart TV is just 4-5 years. And after that if your any tv starts trouble shooting that replace with new one. Because repairing cost is as much as high as you can buy a new tv by adding some more amount. Overall best tv in this price range.",NEGATIVE
Hi I am thinking to buy 43 inch led tv. I am search many company tv and watch YouTube videos and think which should I buy learn every tv review and I decide to buy xiomi x pro 43 inch after check and watch many negative reviews and I am glad to thanks mi to this tv it's great experience to other brand tv at this price range I am manually install this no need company service for installation remote is very good Bluetooth connectivity and display quality is superb pathwall is 👍 4k is awesome great deal,POSITIVE
"Overall 4K performance is very good. Very sleek, elegant look and attractive design. Dolby vision enhance the colour, Black brightness performance is very good. Dolby Atmos/DTS sound is ok and should have enhanced the experience. Dual network, works with 5G for better internet speed. Google TV and Alexa Fire TV both function well with their assistants. Patchwall works fine to watch free live TV. Inbuilt Google Assistant mic easy to controlling TV and Chromecast inbuilt. Brilliant remote finishing and very sleek design.  It's 1 star BEE rated TV which consume more electric power. TV frequency refresh rate lags, should have improved in time frame. No wall mount free. No power adaptor.  Installation is from Amazon, they are charging high amount for wall mount comparing with MI brand. Suggest to get installation from MI brand.  Giving 4 star for installation hidden/false charges and TV frequency refresh rate.",POSITIVE

"I purchased an Acer Super series 55 inc tv on Jan 2025 , and its very nice tv that I filter for mid-range people who look for the best Audio quality and Best Video Quality. The Best I can say in this Tv is the Audio Quality it has an 80w Speaker and the Sound it Too good and the Base is High and it contains Dolby Atmos. and it has a wide range of audio settings. Comming to video Quality you will have a good Video Quality and a bright Screen and we have other picture settings. 1.

"I recently purchased the Acer V Pro 32-inch TV, and overall, I'm extremely satisfied with its performance. The picture quality is crisp and clear, the sound is impressive, and the smart TV features are seamless.  However, I've encountered one major issue - the Chromecast feature is not working. Despite multiple attempts to troubleshoot, I've been unable to get it to work. This is a significant drawback, as I was looking forward to casting content from my phone to the TV.  Aside from this issue, the TV has exceeded my expectations. The design is sleek, the interface is user-friendly, and the price is unbeatable.  If Acer can resolve the Chromecast issue, I'd gladly give this TV a 5-star rating. Until then, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great smart TV, but with the caveat that Chromecast may not work.  Pros:  - Excellent picture quality - Impressive sound - Seamless smart TV features - Sleek design - Affordable price  Cons:  - Chromecast feature not working",NEGATIVE
"The Acer V Pro Series 32-inch QLED HD Ready Smart Google TV is a great budget-friendly option with impressive features. Its QLED display delivers vibrant colors and sharp visuals, while the 30W Dolby Audio system provides clear, immersive sound. Powered by Google TV with Android 14, it offers a smooth interface and access to a wide range of apps.",POSITIVE
"Do not fall for the stamping of the word ""QLED"" or the ""4 years Warranty"", as it doesn't have any characteristics or quality of a QLED and anyhow that warranty of 4 years can only replace a defective product, but not improve an inferior product.  At first the TV would appear very compelling right upon installation and when the room is light up. But as you use it more often and watch different types of content on different OTT apps and under different lighting conditions, you'll come to realise how inferior this TV is .  Here's what my observations are after 72 hours of thorough usage:  1. YouTube app is unusable. Whenever you play an HDR 4K video, there is some popping and cracking sound ( like pat-pat-pat) coming from the speakers, whether the volume is at 20% or 80% or full . I have reset the TV thrice and restart it each time this popping sound comes, but barely 10 minutes after a restart/reset the sound starts coming again. Check the uploaded video.  2. The Panel is a really low quality one. Blacks seem to be non existent. The screen appears to be greyish with dark patches on the screen. Photo uploaded.  3. There is notable heavy vertical banding on bluish tint pictures. Observe the thick greenish pixelated and vertical bands on the Hotstar app's menu in the photo uploaded.  4. MEMC does nothing. In fast moving scenes there is heavy blurring around moving objects. For reference - watch the tiger fight scene in movie RRR. Moreover it's a headache watching a cricket match. The ball appears blurry and the follow through of batsmen is so choppy.  5. If you use the TV for more than 30 minutes with a couple of app switching in between, the UI starts lagging. (a)You press Netflix hotkey and it takes 10 seconds to open . (b)You tap on the volume up key, the volume bar starts increasing volume rapidly and then immediately starts decreasing on its own. (c) Moreover the menu selection bar gets cropped and stuck. A portion of the bar gets stuck on the menu page and the remaining bar continues to scroll. Photo attached .  6. Either it's a bug or the TV has no volume memory feature. Everytime you switch off the TV from the mains and turn it back on, the volume goes to 100%. You'll be startled by the blasting sound when you accidentally play anything without realising the volume is at 100%.  7. The Bluetooth Connectivity is really bad on this TV. I like to connect my Bluetooth TWS at night time so that next room family member doesn't get disturbed by the sound/music. But the sound is very choppy over Bluetooth and with the slightest of head movement, the Bluetooth connection between the TV and TWS starts to break and sound gets distorted. I use Samsung Buds PRO and they work well without any issues at 30 feet distance from my phone. So there's definitely something wrong with the Bluetooth of the TV as the Bluetooth remote of the TV also has lag and response issues.  My Advice after learning from this purchase the hard way:  1. Rather than buying an entry level QLED at 30K , go for a premium LED at that price point .  2. Never be the first to try out a budget version of a high end product category (QLED) from a tier 2 or tier 3 brand.  3. There is no possible way to make and sell a QLED at half the price of reputed brands. If a brand is selling such a product at half the price, then accept the fact that there is going to be a major compromise on Screen quality, Processor, Imaging & Graphics engine.",NEGATIVE
"Product is very good. Picture Quality is Very Good & Sound Quality is really Great! Even in very high volume, sound doesn't crack & there is good ""Bass"" & also crisp ""Treble"" in sound. There are extensive controls for Picture(like Backlight, Brightness, Contrast, Colour, Gamma...) & Sound(like Eualizer). Definitely recommended to anyone looking for high quality at a reasonable price!",POSITIVE
"Value For Money, Picture Clarity & Sound Quality Is Really Really Awesome Really I Liked This Product Quality Of Product is No.1 Installation Is Also Very Simple Size & Design Altimate.",POSITIVE
"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE
Samsung products are good. Installation service is also good. Performance and display quality is very best. Really value for money. I bought this with the brand name.,POSITIVE
"Background : I was in search for a good but not pricey TV because of the following  1. My Samsung 49"" K6300 Curved TV had gone kaput in 4-5 years (DOP - Somewhere in 2017 - early 2018) 2. I was dragging my old TV with ever growing shadows accompanied with visibility issues. 3. K6300 was an eye pleasure when in good condition with amazing blacks and motion smoothness - beautiful out of the box colors.  Since a Tier 1 brand like Samsung had betrayed the trust after paying a premium , I was in the lookout of a mid range TV with up-to-date features - my check list included the following  1. Solid warranty clause with no Money extorsion policies like LG OLED post 1 year end. 2. Good sound system - Preferably with a sub-woofer. 3. Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.  I think I am tending to increase ratings from 4 to 5 stars. Just for the REGZA Pic & Sound from Toshiba.  Good and durable Japanese brands Like Sanyo, Toshiba, Panasonic ( that bring in proprietary tech) should be endorsed (even thought they may be manufactured locally under strategic partnerships) by the Indians else everything is gonna be PRC/Korea Inspired.",POSITIVE
"Initially I want to buy infinix qled t.v because of earlier experience with the brand was good moreover it was 8000 Rs economical to Toshiba but I switch over to Toshiba because of brand reputation most of the well-known brands like infinix,Motorola,Kodak,Blaupunkt, Thomson etc. used to market third party manufacturers product though I am not certain Toshiba manufacturer this t.v or it is also playing the same game but I take a bet because of goodwill and three years of warranty which no other brand is providing.I have been using the t.v for three months I have following observations about this t.v- 1-Picture quality is great (Good contrast,Punchy colours, Wide colour gamut,No screen bleeding issues,Deeper black level) can be good or at par with brands like Samsung,LG, Panasonic inferior to Sony) so there is no comparison with other brands they will fall short. 2- Toshiba's proprietary Regza chip is damm fast as well as do best upscaling moreover it's own ui makes it fast in comparison to android t.v's present in the market don't compare it's ram and rom because it can do it's work swiftly in comparision with brands having double ram and rom nodoubt because of rom storage can be issue for some. 3- Sound quality is great to me it varies person to person vocals are clear and crisp, lacking bass and surround experience is great.sound is pleasing in most of scenarios like 4k movies, webseries,games,news, loudness is sufficient for room 12×15 size of room is at par with Samsung and LG t.v's of this size. 4- settings menu is easily operable, build quality is good,great aesthetics with well built functional remote. Can be improved -. 1- Bass 2-behaves like va panel so viewing angles are not that great but not that much colour shift is seen. After one month see my video review of this t.v on my YouTube channel shobhits exact evaluation .",POSITIVE
"I've had this TV now for near 4 months. The positives are that the build quality, picture quality & sound quality are all great. The only two negatives are the OS & the lack of Filmmaker mode. So I recommend getting a FireTV device or a similar device to remedy the OS issue; the lack of Filmmaker mode means you will need to manually adjust the picture quality to give you the best viewing experience possible. Having said this the TV is still a very good buy at the price.",POSITIVE
"This TV offers excellent picture quality with vibrant colors and sharp 4K resolution. Sound is also clear .The smart features are intuitive, with a responsive interface but a limited app store due to the OS. Its sleek design and ample connectivity options are also strong points. it's a solid choice for those seeking a high-quality TV at a reasonable price. Would recommend, especially for casual viewers.",POSITIVE
I have been using this tv since last 3 months and its the best tv anyone can consider at this price range with best 4k gaming features and quality output. It provides great colour and audio quality is also perfect over all sound effects - consist with good function and all expected and used ports - vidaa os is very smooth and with updates i think will provide better options - brightness over 70% feels very adequate and perfect  overall can be considered as the best 4k gaming tv with good refresh rate in budget range of 50-60k,POSITIVE
"Only thing that this tv lacked was the OS(not google/android). But after 3 months I think hisense own OS ""Vida"" is way faster,snappy. Casting your laptop or android phone has no lag. Also has airplay.  Specs are near perfect [in Q3/2024]. Speakers 40wt is good enough. I rarely turn on my home theater unless I neeed that Booom in my living room. Sound is enough to fill a big indian living room.  Only negative: google has more apps. Vida is adding apps but they need pick up some pace. They have all the basic apps you would need. You can run any video audio format via usb. No need to install video players. In jan 2025 these apps as available: Netflix,youtube, disneyplus, prime, sony, zee5, apply, crunchy roll, jio cinema, yupptv.  Most of the other are not for India region. No VPN app that I could find.  Conclusion: worth your money, perfect specs, needs more india based apps, no issues with PS5 or Ps4.",POSITIVE
"This is my second Hisense TV purchase, and I am very pleased once again. The picture quality is excellent. The sound quality is impressive considering the slim build of the TV; the subwoofer is decent, providing enough bass, though it doesn’t quite match the depth of a dedicated subwoofer. So you'll have to go for external speakers if you want that extra thump.  This TV has a lot of features, many of which I haven't tested yet. The Vidaa OS operates smoothly, but the downside with it not being an android/Google TV is the limited availability of apps. I'm a Spotify subscriber and I often listen to music on my old Hisense android tv which seamlessly connects with spotify, but this TV doesn't, which is disappointing. And if you have a Hotstar Premium subscription, you won’t be able to watch content in 4K on this TV for some reason, it only goes upto 1080p. However, I have paired this TV with a Jio STB, so I don't rely on the built-in apps much.  Overall, it’s a very good TV if you primarily want to enjoy your TV channels and some OTT apps.  I'd give it a solid 4.5/5 ⭐",POSITIVE
"I owned a Hisense Television which I was really happy with, and that encouraged me to choose Hisense while I was looking for a bigger size. And with all honesty, I can say that this one's even better. Picture, Sound, Built, even the viewing angles are excellent. Perfect TV at justifyable price",POSITIVE
"The Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers an excellent combination of performance, features, and value. With a large 65-inch screen, it delivers crisp 4K resolution, vibrant colors, and decent contrast. The picture quality is solid for the price, making it a great choice for those who want an affordable yet high-performing TV for watching movies, TV shows, or gaming.  The smart features are intuitive and easy to use, thanks to its Android TV platform, which provides access to a wide variety of streaming services, apps, and built-in voice control with Google Assistant. The TV supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, offering an enhanced viewing experience with deeper blacks and brighter highlights.  In terms of design, the Hisense 65-inch TV has a sleek and modern look, with slim bezels that allow for a more immersive viewing experience. The sound quality is decent, but for an enhanced audio experience, pairing it with an external soundbar or home theater system might be a good idea.  Connectivity options are solid, with multiple HDMI ports, USB inputs, and Wi-Fi support, making it easy to hook up your devices.  Overall, the Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers impressive value for its price, delivering great picture quality, user-friendly smart features, and a modern design. It’s a solid option for anyone looking for a large, budget-friendly smart TV.",POSITIVE
Im super impressed by this tv. Amazing quality crisp sound and video. Lets hope it has longetivity! For now definetly worth every rupee,POSITIVE
"Bought this Q7N Tornado in August 2024. Review after 4 months :- Problem : bright colors causes eye strain. I even tried cinema mode, film maker mode, energy saving mode, standard mode of video but the eyes pain / eyes feel tired after watching the TV from 10-12 feet distance for 1 to 2 hours.  Benefits: Very good picture quality and clarity. 4k is very nice but too bright. Sound quality is very good nothing negative there. Connectivity options are good hdmi, usb, Bluetooth WiFi all connect very well. Vida OS is awesome no lag so far and I need only few apps like Netflix, prime, YouTube, hotstar ,zee5, sonyliv. All these apps are sufficient.  Since the screen is smooth, if you have tubelight or light or window directly opposite face to the TV then you see the reflection/glare of that tubelight or window sun light. Need to make the room darker by curtains or off the tubelight to remove its glare. I wish the screen was with matt anti-glare finishing.  Atleast I hope the company puts out some video settings recommendations to reduce eye strain for watching this TV. My old Samsung LCD 32 inch screen was better and caused no eye strain.",POSITIVE
good quality for a good price,POSITIVE
"Multiple options of audio/video input/output. I can connect my Bluetooth headphones to it. Picture quality is great. Can control with phone via App. Some was saying that it is a bit slow to respond, I don't feel so. View angles are great, colour stays same at any direction. It's worth it money. Using it for 5 months so far.",POSITIVE
"BEST VALUE FOR MONEY, KEPT SEARCHING FOR 6 MONTHS, AND WHEN I PURCHASED IT, I WAS SO SCARED TO REGRET IT!  AND NOW AFTER COUPLE OF MONTHS I CAN CONFIRM I DID NOT REGRET IT! I USE IT ONLY TO WATCH CARTOON FOR KIDS AND ME STREAMING. I HAVE A CHROME CAST, BUT NO LONGER USING IT THE SOFTWARE IS STABLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME USE IT DIRECTLY AND NO CHROME CAST LIKE MY OLD TV  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,",NEGATIVE
"It's worth the price, i realy like this TV E7k 55""!!!picture quality,the tv speaker,for gaming ps5 with 60hz native.hiw fast to navigate on the homescreen.like they say, i recommend this TV with good features that will not break the bank.. But if you have budget for qled like this with 144hz go for it. But for me, from my 7 y/o LG 59"" its a great upgrade and i am satisfied with this TV.",POSITIVE
good in evry thing except it is vivid system not open app sestem program no way to add any app out of vivid stor,NEGATIVE
"Overall a value product (75 inch) with very good quality. Happy with the sound and screen brightness. Design could have been sleeker, yet Google TV makes it worth it",POSITIVE
Writing this review after 15 days of use I got the 55inch C61b for rs 31739 effective without no cost emi discount. For that price its a steal deal!! Pros: Sound - the 35w onkyo speaker system on this tv is beast. You won’t need a soundbar if your room is below 150 sqft. The bass is good. The sound clarity is superb. No distortion even in higher volumes. Best speaker system that I have seen in a tv. Picture- its a VA qled panel The picture quality is very good Blacks are deep Colours are punchy No complaints with picture fully satisfied The google tv os is very responsive with minor lags only after booting which goes away after sometimes. Dolby vision HDR HLG HDR10+ supports are there You need to adjust few settings to avoid motion smoothening issue Gaming mode is also there  Cons The con I felt is the little backlight bleeding on edges which you won’t notice normally But visible in grey screens not in black So not a big issue Installation is very late I got call after 8th day for installation  Overall this is the best tv you can buy under 40k Go for 55 inch or above the onkyo sound is superb Will definitely recommend,POSITIVE
TCL is very good picture quality with affordable price for this QLED TV and very nice audio experience. This TV is equal of samsung and sony and LG TV picture quality.  Worth product,POSITIVE
"Its a review of the 55 inch tv!!! PROS: 1. Design: With minimum bezels, its an updated design, feels premium by the sleek edges. 2. Display: The TV supports DOLBY vision, 4k with QLED. If you are upgrading from an HD tv, you are going to be blown away by the colour output it generates. The colour contrast with deep blacks is quite amazing. I personally haven't tried game mode so cannot comment. I have tried connecting my gaming laptop in HDMI, played FC24, it feels good by the amazing 55 inches display. The tv is quite bright even in sunny daylight. Viewing angle is also good. 3. Sound: The TV comes with a 20W speaker in the back, has a good bass and is quite loud. If you are music enthusiast, you won't be impressed. Its loud and clear and satisfactory when compared to other tv's in the market. No distortion even at 100% volume. 4. Connectivity: Wifi connectivity is good. I use my 5G phone for internet connection with unlimited pack. No lagging issues at all and its a GOOGLE TV so you get maximum app support. CONS: 1. Display: If you are a sports lover, you would be disappointed. The tv has jittering issues and motion clarity isn't good when it comes to sports. High action scenes with fast movement is where the tv lags. When watching cricket, the motion clarity isn't good enough. FINAL VERDICT: I bought this 55 inch tv for 34k. In this price point, you surely won't be disappointed at all. Its the best OLED TV you can find in the market. Trust me, even SAMSUNG, LG and SONY fails when compared with price. I personally visited Relaince Digital before buying the TV online. I compared all the TV's and bought this after thorough research. Buy this tv and you wouldn't regret at all. The only CON isn't a deal breaker at all. I love watching cricket and its ok with the jittering. I am pretty satisfied with the overall experience. I recommend buying the 4k pack of OTT's like Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime. You would love the overall viewing experience of watching movies and series in this huge display.",POSITIVE
I rarely give a 5 star .. It got amazing picture quality and decent soundd quality... The tv runs pretty fast and the blacks are so deep... Good upscaling... Best under 40k for 43inches tv,POSITIVE
Product is good but installation guys were in hurry..as they are service provider also hence not raised any complaint..,NEGATIVE
After using 3 weeks i must say I chosen the best 4K TV with the price best sound best picture quality best configuration best product best 4K best colours on the TV,POSITIVE
"I bought this TV for watching in my home. I like the build and the sleek design. One Important matter I want to bring to your notice is that communication within Amazon to its customers are leaking out....... After delivery, I was informed by Amazon that the technician will come the next day (Sunday) who didn't turn up. After that, I got another intimation from Amazon stating that a new technician will come the NEXT day for installation. He did. However, in between I got an anonymous call from UK stating that they are calling from Amazon and informed me of the technician's visit and asked me to confirm by pressing 1 or 9 to cancel.....!!!! I ignored the call. This is just for your information to take up matter within so as to plug any loophole in your communication leakage.",NEGATIVE
"I haven't used an android/google TV before. If you're already a heavy youtube user, the TV is for you. The picture quality is great despite its price, it delivers great value for your money. This TV is a price - performance monster, I can honestly say.",POSITIVE
"TV was okay initially but started running slowly after a couple months. The menu scrolling lags so much and TV restarts evertime I start apps like netflix. I have kept the software up to date and done all sorts of trouble shooting with no fix. Picture and sound quality are excellent but TV is so laggy and unpredictable. I would have returned it, but window is closed.",NEGATIVE
"Our old LG tv was past it's best and with strong sunlight the picture was very dark. We looked at TCL and Hisense in Currys but they didn't really seem interested in selling us one and were trying to push expensive Samsung's onto us. We didn't want to spend that much so retired to Costa for a coffee. Whilst there I looked on Amazon and noticed the price of the 50"" TCL had dropped to £299 so went for it, the Currys price was £374 at the time.  So far it has been very good with excellent picture quality, however this is an Android tv and setting it up was a pain with not much help from the manual. Altogether it took two days messing around to get a decent setup! Android is a mobile phone operating system owned by Google, so they really push you to either log in to your Google account or set one up. I'm not the greatest fan of Google because it wants to know too much of your business but there are a few videos on YouTube (also owned by Google!) about setting it up as a standalone. On all my old tv's you scan for channels and it works, not any more so beware.  Once I'd scanned all the channels in (nearly 1000!) the picture went to a ""Home screen"" and I hadn't got a clue what to do next. Eventually by a matter of trial and error and just pushing buttons on the remote I got onto a channel list and got Freeview to work, please note there is no built in Freesat on this as there was on our old LG. The channels were all over the place with BBC at about channel 45. Lots of channels didn't work with a message saying some dongle or other wasn't installed and to be honest I was not very impressed at the end of day 1.  On day 2 I decided to re-scan the channels and noticed a few options so opted for ""Free only"". This made a big difference and the ""dongle"" channels had disappeared. The channels were all still mixed up and then I noticed the channel list was in alphabetical order, so ITV was way down the list. This was getting more and more frustrating by the minute until I found a channel organizer in the settings. This brings up the channel list again but using the remote it's possible to click on a channel which brings an option box up. One of the options is ""Move"", by clicking on this option then clicking on another channel number the first channel moves to the new position. So I was able to move BBC1 to channel 1 and then spent the next few hours moving dozens of other channels as well. There is a ""Favourites"" option but I still haven't worked that one out yet.  Is it a good tv? I would say yes but be prepared for a lot of faffing about unless you are a wizz kid geek. I still haven't worked it all out but have got it so it's watchable but even now after a few weeks I still get confused by it, mainly trying to get from the home screen onto normal channels.",NEGATIVE
Superb value great picture quality easy set up migration,POSITIVE
"I received the TV brand new, after i removed the tape, i saw that there are two huge dots where the pixels are dead.",NEGATIVE

"I purchased a Sony Bravia 3 55-inch TV on September 20th, 2024, and it was delivered the very next day with a quick installation. However, the technician did not check the screen using a white display during installation.  Today, after returning from work, I noticed a black spot on the right side of the panel. I opened a white screen video on YouTube and was shocked to see a large black spot. I spent ₹86,000 on this TV, trusting the Sony brand, but I am deeply disappointed to find an issue in a brand-new product.  I contacted Sony customer care, and I am currently waiting for a technician to visit. I expect a replacement and hope Sony will ensure no issues in a new TV.  My initial product experience was underwhelming, but Sony's post-purchase support was outstanding. Priyanka from Sony head office proactive assistance and swift resolution demonstrated the brand's dedication to customer satisfaction. This experience reinforced my faith in Sony's quality and after-sales service.  I am giving 4 start for Sony after sale service and to ensure a Happy customer.",POSITIVE
"Worth it totally, picture quality is best and sound is amazing",POSITIVE
"I bought a Sony Bravia 3 TV on 26th September 2024, and the experience has been nothing short of frustrating.  1. Price Discrepancy for Prime Members: As a Prime customer, I paid ₹1,000 more than the price listed during the regular sale, which felt unfair.  2. Manufacturing Defect: During open box delivery, the TV appeared fine, but when the Sony technician installed it, we discovered the screen was broken from the inside—a manufacturing defect. This was a major disappointment after spending so much money.  3. Complicated Return Process: Despite the product page promising a replacement, I was told it could only be returned. The return process was unnecessarily difficult, and after multiple issues, my refund is expected by 10th October.  Overall, this experience has been frustrating and has left me with a significant trust deficit. I won’t be making large purchases from Amazon again.",NEGATIVE
This is a good TV for the price. I loved it. Picture quality and sound is good.,POSITIVE
"The quality of the product is excellent, with impressive sound and picture quality. The resolution is outstanding, making it worth every penny.",POSITIVE

The product is really Good. The installation was done immediately the next day and a neat demo was given.

Thank you Acer for the product quality.,POSITIVE

Connectivity is an issue; whenever I try to pair it with my Bluetooth device, it fails. 2/10 Overall, at such a price, it's a value for money.",NEGATIVE
This tv is a good and well performed.but some times it may be stucked and doesnot respond.but overall performance is good and clarity wise and sound quality it's nice tv.worth for money,POSITIVE
"The screen is bright and does its job quite well while displaying 4k content. Speakers are of only 36wh but the output is way better for an apartment type home. Its value for money definitely acer is doing amazing in budget TV section. The processor is one con that I discovered that it can get laggy, it forcefully gets out of apps to maintain the performance but you can sometimes feel the laggyness. I'd hope acer will use better processors for next lineup of TVs. Except the processor, everything is good and the product is recommendable.",POSITIVE
"The Acer 40-inch Smart Full HD TV is an impressive addition to any home entertainment setup. With its sleek design and vibrant display, it truly elevates the viewing experience. The Full HD resolution delivers stunning clarity and color depth, making movies, sports, and games come alive with detail.

Highly recommended for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike!",POSITIVE
"Putting this review after almost a month of usage. Picture quality and streaming quality is good. Display colour and sound also great. But lagging in performance, bluetooth remote sometimes not working, and only works through IR mode. Surfing between apps is still a bad experience. Viewing files in the pendrive is so much difficult. Even a 720p video can't be played smoothly when it's on my pendrive, but streaming a 1080p video through ott apps still works smoother. User interface is good, adjusting screen brightness, making some changes in the settings during an app usage is better than MI TVs. On an average It's good for the pricing, but it's not promising the specifications mentioned by the company, Acer should improve these things in the upcoming updates.",NEGATIVE
The acer I pro 43 inch 4k tv has very nice picture quality. There is minor lag in settings. Other then that UI is very smooth. My only problem is with the video playback from external hard disk. The inbuilt media player keep crashing while play 4k movies. some time takes too much time to load videos from hard disk and also sometimes it got stuck while fast forwarding. The issue doesn't solve with other media player. Nova player works fine in this tv but doesn't support HDR . The MX plays can play HDR videos but keeps freezing in this. (Both player works fine with my mi box 4k). I purchased this tv hoping the newer processor in this model will be more powerful but that's not the case. Or it may be it is some optimization problem. Otherwise tha picture quality is very good while playing online videos.,NEGATIVE
"Today, I received my Acer I Pro 55-inch TV, and after watching it, I want to share my review with all of you. This review will focus on my experience with the VA panel TV.  After watching multiple reviews on YouTube, I bought this TV, but I am very disappointed with those YouTubers. While they highlighted many positive aspects of the TV, they did not properly explain the limitations of the VA panel.  Here’s the issue: VA panels lose color accuracy when viewed from angles beyond 20 degrees. These panels are excellent if you’re viewing the TV directly from the front, where they provide 100% color accuracy. However, as soon as you change your viewing angle, you will notice significant color distortion. The picture begins to fade, and if your seating position changes to 30 to 40 degrees, the colors look completely washed out, and the picture loses its vibrancy.  Based on my experience, I strongly suggest that before purchasing a large-screen TV, visit a store and compare VA panels TV with IPS panels TV, especially on SD channels, which many of us watch daily. This will help you make a more informed decision.",NEGATIVE

"It is good, sound quality and display are good.",POSITIVE
"Folks, I write this review with great pain. But APATHY-laden AMAZON & Obnoxious ONIDA collaborates to mistreat a customer. Almost all smart TVs in this price range are of the same quality. One chooses to buy from a platform like Amazon for the ease of it.  But, that’s exactly what I did not get. The EASE and the PEACE OF MIND.  First of all, the delivery of Amazon in mountains regions for heavy appliances is outsourced to Delhivery and those folks have their own attitude. They won’t deliver the product even if your house is one step away from the road. I had to practically carry the TV on my own.  Now starts the real Agony from Amazon. A simple installation that should have taken 2 days, took THREE WEEKS. Yes, you read that right. It took three weeks for the installation guys to get bothered. On top of that, Amazon had the audacity to mark the installation service as COMPLETE without bothering to check what was happening.  When contacted, the lackadaisical customer service of Amazon (“Amazon’s poor customer service”) simply washed their hands off the matter an asked me to contact the brand again for installation. No apology, no attitude of customer satisfaction, no nothing. When I pushed, they were still arrogant enough to say, “Get it installed yourself, we will pay the money.”  Was it just about the money, folks? Who will make up for the mistreatment from Onida and Amazon; the APATHY FOR NOT EVEN CHECKING THE STATUS OF THE SERVICE and still MARKING IT “COMPLETE”?  Extremely poor customer service from Apathy-laden Amazon! Never buy heavy appliances from them if you live in a non-metro location.",NEGATIVE

"There is a problem in sound always when I go to any OTT apps and switch to DTH TV there is no audio I have to restart it again and also whenever the power is gone DTH TV remote does not work I have to use both the Remotes to operate. Picture Quality is average, not User friendly, lag between apps and DTH.",NEGATIVE
"Nice picture quality, no issue in connectivity, warming, value for money, old brand but very good advance features. I am happy on purchasing the product.",POSITIVE
Good product,POSITIVE
"The TV itself is good, and I’ve owned TCL products before without issues. However, purchasing high-value items from Amazon comes with serious risks due to their poor post-purchase support.  Installation was repeatedly delayed, and despite multiple follow-ups, no resolution was provided. Customer support was unprofessional, unhelpful, and unwilling to take ownership of the issue. I ultimately had to return the product—not because of TCL, but due to Amazon’s failure to provide the necessary service.  If you’re considering buying expensive electronics here, be prepared for a frustrating experience if you ever need support.",NEGATIVE
Good quality for this price. If u choose other brands you have to pay ₹5000 to 15000 extra .,POSITIVE
"I bought TCL 75 inches 4K UHD LED TV after lot of research on specifications and price bargain.  This TV is really a catch @ Rs 69,990 when I bought in December 2023. Great deal on 75 inches TV. Thanks to TCL.  Moreover, the colours and brightness and viewing pleasure is really very satisfactory.  I was dreaming to buy Mini LED TV but it was very costly and out of my budget. So I closed down on this great value for money deal on TCL 75 inches giant screen TV at an amazing price tag of Rs 69,990.  Sound is 30W RMS. It's really crystal clear and very good to listen each minute audio detail. I have a soundbar but now no need to use it as the TV sound is almost like a soundbar and it's powerful.  TV has got HDMI eARC connectivity. I am using soundbar as well as Sony wireless headphone L600 - both with eARC connectivity. So it was super easy to connect my soundbar as well as wireles headphone with TCL TV seamlessly.  The remote controller unit is also very nice. It's bit slim and long which looks different from other brands and easy to handle. All required shortcut buttons are given.  It's a Google TV. So supports Google voice search.  We are very happy on our decision to buy TCL 75 inches 4K UHD TV.  I hope this TV will serve us for few years to come without any technical problems. I will post my post use feedback soon in next year 2024.  Thank you.",POSITIVE
TCL is affordable price very good picture quality this TV equal samsung & Sony viewing experience,POSITIVE
Quality is very good.,POSITIVE
"We bought the TV 3 months back. In a month, the TV started getting hanged and did not work smoothly. Even after following all the instructions, the problem didn't get solved. Also the after service of the company is pathetic. When we asked to replace the product, they denied and did made reasons like technician will come and check the product. It's been more than 20 days we are trying to reach th but no one is responding to our complaint. Also the customer care number that is mentioned is of no use as no one answered or addressed our complaint. There is Lag, poor picture quality before the TV started getting hanged. And now TV is not working at all. It's stuck on TCL logo and keeping getting restart, doesn't go ahead of it. Never buy or go for TCL products as they don't respond or replace the product even when it's in the warranty period.  Just because it's less price, don't buy it as money gets wasted. Better to put extra and buy another brand.",NEGATIVE

"I recently purchased the Acer V Pro 32-inch TV, and overall, I'm extremely satisfied with its performance. The picture quality is crisp and clear, the sound is impressive, and the smart TV features are seamless.  However, I've encountered one major issue - the Chromecast feature is not working. Despite multiple attempts to troubleshoot, I've been unable to get it to work. This is a significant drawback, as I was looking forward to casting content from my phone to the TV.  Aside from this issue, the TV has exceeded my expectations. The design is sleek, the interface is user-friendly, and the price is unbeatable.  If Acer can resolve the Chromecast issue, I'd gladly give this TV a 5-star rating. Until then, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great smart TV, but with the caveat that Chromecast may not work.  Pros:  - Excellent picture quality - Impressive sound - Seamless smart TV features - Sleek design - Affordable price  Cons:  - Chromecast feature not working",NEGATIVE
"The Acer V Pro Series 32-inch QLED HD Ready Smart Google TV is a great budget-friendly option with impressive features. Its QLED display delivers vibrant colors and sharp visuals, while the 30W Dolby Audio system provides clear, immersive sound. Powered by Google TV with Android 14, it offers a smooth interface and access to a wide range of apps.",POSITIVE
"Do not fall for the stamping of the word ""QLED"" or the ""4 years Warranty"", as it doesn't have any characteristics or quality of a QLED and anyhow that warranty of 4 years can only replace a defective product, but not improve an inferior product.  At first the TV would appear very compelling right upon installation and when the room is light up. But as you use it more often and watch different types of content on different OTT apps and under different lighting conditions, you'll come to realise how inferior this TV is .  Here's what my observations are after 72 hours of thorough usage:  1. YouTube app is unusable. Whenever you play an HDR 4K video, there is some popping and cracking sound ( like pat-pat-pat) coming from the speakers, whether the volume is at 20% or 80% or full . I have reset the TV thrice and restart it each time this popping sound comes, but barely 10 minutes after a restart/reset the sound starts coming again. Check the uploaded video.  2. The Panel is a really low quality one. Blacks seem to be non existent. The screen appears to be greyish with dark patches on the screen. Photo uploaded.  3. There is notable heavy vertical banding on bluish tint pictures. Observe the thick greenish pixelated and vertical bands on the Hotstar app's menu in the photo uploaded.  4. MEMC does nothing. In fast moving scenes there is heavy blurring around moving objects. For reference - watch the tiger fight scene in movie RRR. Moreover it's a headache watching a cricket match. The ball appears blurry and the follow through of batsmen is so choppy.  5. If you use the TV for more than 30 minutes with a couple of app switching in between, the UI starts lagging. (a)You press Netflix hotkey and it takes 10 seconds to open . (b)You tap on the volume up key, the volume bar starts increasing volume rapidly and then immediately starts decreasing on its own. (c) Moreover the menu selection bar gets cropped and stuck. A portion of the bar gets stuck on the menu page and the remaining bar continues to scroll. Photo attached .  6. Either it's a bug or the TV has no volume memory feature. Everytime you switch off the TV from the mains and turn it back on, the volume goes to 100%. You'll be startled by the blasting sound when you accidentally play anything without realising the volume is at 100%.  7. The Bluetooth Connectivity is really bad on this TV. I like to connect my Bluetooth TWS at night time so that next room family member doesn't get disturbed by the sound/music. But the sound is very choppy over Bluetooth and with the slightest of head movement, the Bluetooth connection between the TV and TWS starts to break and sound gets distorted. I use Samsung Buds PRO and they work well without any issues at 30 feet distance from my phone. So there's definitely something wrong with the Bluetooth of the TV as the Bluetooth remote of the TV also has lag and response issues.  My Advice after learning from this purchase the hard way:  1. Rather than buying an entry level QLED at 30K , go for a premium LED at that price point .  2. Never be the first to try out a budget version of a high end product category (QLED) from a tier 2 or tier 3 brand.  3. There is no possible way to make and sell a QLED at half the price of reputed brands. If a brand is selling such a product at half the price, then accept the fact that there is going to be a major compromise on Screen quality, Processor, Imaging & Graphics engine.",NEGATIVE
"Product is very good. Picture Quality is Very Good & Sound Quality is really Great! Even in very high volume, sound doesn't crack & there is good ""Bass"" & also crisp ""Treble"" in sound. There are extensive controls for Picture(like Backlight, Brightness, Contrast, Colour, Gamma...) & Sound(like Eualizer). Definitely recommended to anyone looking for high quality at a reasonable price!",POSITIVE
"Satisfied with picture quality, sound..value for money. Good product at low price.",POSITIVE
Better quality for low cost. I brought this 43 inch iFFLCON TV in July-2024 for my sister. Seems to be good for the money I spent. Better quality picture and sound system. Performance so far found to be good.,POSITIVE
"This TV is sick! The quality is top-notch, and the sound is on point. No need to waste money on a soundbar. Plus, the viewing angles and picture quality are dope.",NEGATIVE
Within 2 month tv screen panel stopped working. The worst thing service i have been following up 30 days still my tv not repaired i don't know they will repair or not. Never buy this tv.,NEGATIVE

I Purchased 50 Inch Television. Overall Good Television in this Budget. Sounds are Perfect and Pixels Clarity are Good. Onlything TV is slow i dont know why. Its not responding fast.,NEGATIVE
I like the TV by its Sound and Picture quality. For RAM management this tv has 2 gb ram and tv having good response time. Option to use the tv without remote either Google assistant or Google tv android app,POSITIVE
"Toshiba TVs are known for their exceptional picture quality and impressive performance. The vibrant colors, sharp details, and smooth motion make the viewing experience truly enjoyable. Whether you're watching movies, sports, or playing games, the display quality never fails to impress. Additionally, the sound clarity and build quality reflect Toshiba's commitment to excellence. Overall, it's a great choice for anyone looking for a premium yet affordable TV. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Toshiba 55-inch TV and I must say, I am extremely impressed with the overall performance and quality of this product. The picture quality is outstanding, with vibrant colors and sharp details that make watching movies and TV shows a truly immersive experience. The sound quality is also top-notch, providing clear and crisp audio that enhances the viewing experience.  I appreciate the sleek and modern design of it ,which looks great in my living room and adds a touch of elegance to the space. The setup was quick and easy, and the user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it a breeze to navigate through different settings and apps.

I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a high-quality viewing experience at an affordable price. Thank you, Toshiba, for delivering such a fantastic product!",POSITIVE
Giveing review after 1 month of use Pros- Overally video and audio Clearity is awesome. Value for money. Cons- In high moving object like while watching cricket observe when ball moves faster it gets blur some time it's seems 2-3 ball are moves faster back to back like that. In short MEMC not provided or not working properly. But it's not big issue,POSITIVE
"The performance of the Toshiba TV is excellent! The picture quality is vibrant, the sound is crisp, and the overall experience has been great. However, the installation process could have been better. While the setup was completed, one side of the TV is slightly tilted down, which was a bit disappointing.  Despite this minor issue, the TV itself delivers an outstanding viewing experience, and I’m very satisfied with the product. Highly recommend it for its performance!",POSITIVE
"The TV is awsome, very nice picture quality and dolby atmos is too good. At this price point you can't ask for more. Yes in comparison to all Android tv this is a bit slow but faster than the rest.  Important part- I read many negative comments or reviews regarding installation failure. The same happened with me, however with constant communication with Amazon they helped me to get the tv installed within the scheduled time. Yes if you are polite enough anyone will help you out.  There are reviews regarding the tv shutting down itself after some time. The same thing happened with me. But it's a energy saving feature of the TV, if you keep it in idle condition it will shutdown. That is a good feature. But illeterate consumers doesn't understand nor study the manual before posting such reviews. It's an awsome tv go for it",NEGATIVE
"TV is a good buy at this price point. Picture quality could have been better, sound is clear and loud. Overall a nice tv.",POSITIVE
"Positives: overall good performance, 2 years of warranty.  Negatives: White light bleeding at the edges of screen very clearly visible in grey screen.",NEGATIVE
"At this price range this is the only TV maybe which has 2 GB RAM, others come at 1 or 1.5 GB RAM. So as a Smart TV you are able to get a glitch free interface.",NEGATIVE
Nice tv picture quality is super this products are value for money,POSITIVE
"Good Sharp picture , easy setup for smart TV , sound is high on treble , better speakers could have been provided.",POSITIVE
"Top quality TVs (Sony, Samsung, LG) are about 2.5-3 times the price... cheap TV (but reputed names.. like MI, Micromax) are abt 2 times this price - this is so low price (other similar priced TVs were of unknown brands.. Kevin has made some name/presence by now), I was pretty sure it was a cheap quality dud! I thought if this TV lasted the warranty period, then its still value for money,... so i took the risk. TV arrived.. it stopped working on the same day!!!!!! inspection+replacement request registered with amazon.. smooth experience there, finally replaced.. and the new TV works perfectly. Note - the installation+warranty time servicing+repairs etc.. has been outsourced by Kevin to a third party company called Jeeves.. they're all digital, with all communications and visits etc recorded via sms-es, emails, etc... very professional. So, if tv ever gets spoilt, the toll-free experience+service/repair experience should be trouble-free. Also Note - There is an extended warranty provided at the time of purchase - for such a cheap tv, if I had 1 yr of extra warranty, then why not? But fr some reason I could not purchase the extended warranty. But at the time of installation, the Jeeves technician offered me extended warranty from them - so, i bought - 2 yrs for 1100Rs. Am glad I couldn't buy extended warranty at time of checkout.. and since Jeeves is the main entity handling repairs etc, it was better to buy from them... So now my cheap TV has a 1+2=3yr warranty! Nice!!!  TV - picture quality - OK.. does the job pretty well, the 15k-20k+Rs TV will be better.. but I don't care, at this price. The non-HD channels have slightly pixellated edges, but I noticed that if I reduced the sharpness to 0, the problem goes away. Everything else is all good - only thing is the ""whites"" seems a bit over-exposed/too bright, and if you reduce the brightness and contrast so that pure white ares of the picture looks alright, then the dark/shadowy/black areas of the picture appear too dark... you have to strike a balance(best settings worked for me at - Brightness-55, Contrast-35, Sharpness-0, Colour/Saturation-35... good balance of reducing overexposed whites and maximising dark-zone clarity), but trust me.. at this price, this is nothing, and you would have a good viewing experience. All other features - eco mode, sound, build quality etc is pretty decent.. no complaints there.  Final verdict - Go for it! super low price, pretty good viewing experience.. total value for money.. definitely go for it if your priority is getting max for your money.. if priority is quality, go for samsung, lg etc. Also, I'd suggest - skip the extended warranty and buy the same at installation time from the Jeeves technician - he may not offer it to you on his own, so ask for it.",NEGATIVE
"Here's a sample review:  *Disappointed with Post-Purchase Experience - Chargeable Installation*  *Rating: 2/5*  I purchased the vw tv from Amazon on 20 oct and received it on 24th October. The delivery was prompt, and the product seems to be in good condition.  However, my excitement was short-lived. When I contacted the installation team, I was informed that installation would be chargeable, which was not mentioned at the time of purchase. This added expense was unexpected and feels like a bait-and-switch.  *Pros:*  - Prompt delivery - Good product quality  *Cons:*  - Misleading information regarding installation costs - Additional charges for installation  *Suggestions:*  - Clearly mention installation costs (if applicable) on the product page - Provide transparent and accurate information to customers before purchase  *Recommendation:*  While the TV itself is satisfactory, the post-purchase experience has left a sour taste. Buyers, beware of potential additional costs. Amazon, please clarify installation costs upfront to avoid disappointing customers.",NEGATIVE
EXCELLENT PRODUCT WITH GOOD REASONABLE AMOUNT MY FAMILY IS VERY HAPY,POSITIVE
"I am extremely impressed with this VW TV! The picture quality is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and sharp details, making it perfect for watching movies and shows. The sound is also surprisingly good for a TV of this size, filling the room nicely without needing a soundbar. The setup was quick and easy, and the smart features work flawlessly, allowing me to stream all my favorite apps without any lag. It's a great value for the price, perfect for smaller rooms or as a second TV. Highly recommend.",POSITIVE
Better product better price,POSITIVE
Best product in this price range. No other brands provide such type of features in this price range. Pros- 1. Best picture quality 2. Good sound quality. 20W speaker provide nice sound for watching movies and tv series. 3. Good customer care support 4. Android OS and playstore available. 5. All connectivity ports are available. Cons. * Installation services is very bad. Service provider not available even after 10 days of delivery.,NEGATIVE
"My gripe is with "" Dawntech Electronics "", the seller. Have sent 1 enquiry and 4 reminders but no reply / answer. Fedup, took my chances and placed order. Fortunately, nothing outward happened. Consider myself lucky. Had the seller replied and clarified my question, the experience would have been very pleasant. I request Amazon to take action against this seller as well similar ones who do not answer to customer's queries. They bring bad image to Amazon platform as well to the brand / item they are selling.  As for the TV, it is beautiful and classy. Great picture and surprisingly, great sound too. A sound bar can be easily avoided. Wish the TV had bigger size of 65"".",NEGATIVE
Up to expectations..... picture quality and sound also... prompt delivery.....and installation.,POSITIVE
"I wish I could give this TV a 0-star rating! I had high expectations for the LG OLED B2 55-inch TV, but the entire experience has been a nightmare. The TV arrived with a completely shattered panel—unbelievable for such an expensive product. The box looked fine, so I can’t even blame shipping. It must have left the factory like this, which tells you all you need to know about LG’s quality control.  To make matters worse, I had to exchange this broken disaster for a fully functioning TV (from another brand, thank goodness), wasting time and effort. LG’s customer service was painfully slow, and it took ages to process the replacement.  Do yourself a favor: avoid this model and save yourself the stress and frustration. LG has clearly dropped the ball on quality and service. Never again!",NEGATIVE
Table stand for TV was not there in the box and promotional OTT offers were not provided as displayed in the product description before purchasing.,NEGATIVE
"The tv is amazing, a rotating wall mount is provided as free by company, the installation took time so had to directly call LG, as Amazon was late.  The overall TV display, remote, UI is good, sound is not that good, so soundbar is required",NEGATIVE
"I purchased it ₹77000 at Ganesh Chaturthi sale with all bank & card & brand offers combined.unfortunately it was last piece of 45 inch. Can be easily fir & installed in your small bedroom. For larger screen sizes, you must place them in dining or drawing or bigger living room. The stand comes with the box and of good quality",POSITIVE
"Purchased this after a bit of confusion between this and the C3 - went for the A3 since I won't be using it for gaming (so I wasn't expecting the FPS to be a pain point). Glad that I did !  Ended up costing me 69k using the ICICI Amazon Pay card during the Prime Day sale, which I think makes it great value for money.  Some users have expressed concerns about the brightness (since A3 does not belong to the evo series) but I did not find this lacking in any way. We use it in bright as well as dim environments and there seems to be no problem with the picture brightness and the clarity at all.  All in all, an excellent purchase made more delightful by the Prime Day offer.  LG reached out proactively and sent someone for the installation, which was a breeze.",POSITIVE
"You will enjoy the Oled screen experience. Perfect black and colours. Sound quality is great, however, if required, one can buy one soundbar. But I feel its not really required. Installation was quick and smooth. 120hz native refresh rate is really great and you can see it clearly. The screen thickness is less than that of a 5 rupees indian coin. Awesome product.",POSITIVE
"Used it more than a month now. TV works great 👍 Sound quality is perfect no need of external speakers. Video quality is mind-blowing. Go for it, won't regret.",POSITIVE
This tv has best sound and pictures quality in reasonable price. i m very happy to use it.,POSITIVE
Nice picture quality and worth the investment,POSITIVE
Excellent picture quality Smooth running!,POSITIVE
"Wanted to purchase a tablet to watch shows on but realised you could get a TV for the same price.  Pros: Quick installation provided, Bluetooth devices supported, HDMI support available, picture quality Cons: Noticeable lag while starting the TV, after 2 months of use",NEGATIVE
"I was mainly a Desktop PC sort of guy. Preferred a 27” 4K Monitor. This is my first large screen tv.  Since ‘twas my first large screen tv, I wanted an inexpensive workhorse type unit that I wouldn’t shed a tear over in case of any learning curve with the tv.  By learning curve I am referring to: 1) Damage during panel cleaning 2) Heating issues 3) Mounting issues 4) Panel damage due to Sunlight 5) Panel damage due to tripping/slipping/mishaps.  So far this TV has proved to be a proper workhorse. A decent 4K panel with vivid colours and average brightness let’s me enjoy OTT media and Sports. Though I use a home theatre, I tested the speakers and they will sound great in a room of around 100-150 Sq.Ft. No connectivity issues, decent chip and gpu. Any life beyond 2 years will be bonus and beyond my expectations.  Also, what made me go for this one over all the other products in this price range was the Brand Name: Westinghouse. I always knew their Electrical appliances are world class, I trusted them with their electronic appliances as well.",POSITIVE
Installation was too difficult... Authorised plumber said wall mounting of the product would lead to display damage. Hence retuned the product,NEGATIVE
It is a very good tv for the budget and clarity sound everything is fantastic even the build quality is very good I highly recommend this product,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Sony Bravia 43-inch 4K Ultra HD TV, and I must say it has exceeded all my expectations! The picture quality is stunning with 4K resolution and the X1 4K Processor. Watching content on it feels like an immersive experience, especially with features like 4K HDR and Motion Flow XR100 that make every scene come to life.  The wide viewing angle ensures that everyone in the room gets a perfect view, and the sound quality, powered by Dolby Audio and Open Baffle speakers, adds richness to the audio, making it feel like you're at a movie theater. The Clear Phase feature enhances the audio further, providing crystal-clear sound.  The smart TV features are incredibly user-friendly. Google TV, voice search, and built-in Chromecast make it easy to stream my favorite shows from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and more. It also supports Apple AirPlay and Alexa, which add convenience to the setup. The one-year warranty provided by Sony is an added bonus, ensuring peace of mind with my purchase.  Overall, I am beyond satisfied with this TV. It offers incredible value for money with a sleek design, top-notch picture and sound quality, and an amazing smart TV experience. Highly recommend it!",POSITIVE
"The Sony Bravia 43-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED Google TV (KD-43X64L) delivers stunning picture quality with vibrant colors and sharp details. The user-friendly Google TV interface offers seamless access to apps and streaming services. Sound quality is clear and immersive, enhancing the viewing experience. Build quality feels premium, and the setup was quick and hassle-free. Overall, it's an excellent choice for a feature-packed smart TV.",POSITIVE
"After a using the 65 inch model for a month, 'll divide the review into pros and cons.  Pros: - The TV IS large. You'll find the difference between the other sizes and this one while watching YouTube or movies/TV shows. It feels like a mini theatre.  - The sound is crisp and clear and the same time loud enough! So poud at just 60% volume. I never had to take it more than 60 and the average sound volume I use is around 45-50 which is enough!  - The quality of 4K is so crisp, even for 1080p Full HD videos. I compared it's quality with chinese brands like Mi, etc. and the difference in clarity is clearly visible.  - it's 4K processor is a notch above! It automatically enhances 1080p and 720p videos. The 720p videos are just good enough, but the 1080p videos are greatly enhanced. - You can connect this TV with you Alexa device and then configure it to perform functions just by giving it voice commands. - You can use the Google TV smartphone app to control the TV with your phone, using it as a remote from any room.  Cons: - Haven't found anything yet!  All in all, it was a good purchase. So if you're looking for a 65 inch great quality 4K TV within ₹1 lac, I'd recommend going for it.",POSITIVE

"**Functionality: 9/10** This Sony bravia X74L is packed with a wide array of smart features. It supports all major streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and more, making it a one-stop shop for all entertainment needs. Additionally, the TV is compatible with both Alexa and Google Assistant, so voice commands can be used to control it. The ability to use multiple input options (HDMI 2.1, USB, Ethernet, etc.) makes it highly functional for different use cases.  **Performance: 10/10** In terms of picture quality, this LED TV is outstanding. The deep blacks, high contrast, and vibrant colors create a stunning viewing experience. Motion handling is excellent, with minimal blurring in fast-moving scenes, making it perfect for sports or action movies. HDR10+ features optimize picture quality scene-by-scene, making content look more lifelike and immersive. Sound performance is also good for a TV, due to lack of Dolby Atmos; you may want an external sound system for a true home theater experience.  **Value for Money: 8/10** This TV is certainly not cheap, but for LED picture quality and top-tier smart features, it’s worth the investment. If you're a movie enthusiast, gamer, or someone who values top-notch display quality, this TV provides solid value for the money.  **Ease of Use: 8.5/10** Setting up the TV is simple, interface being user-friendly and intuitive. The Magic Remote, which acts as both a traditional and a pointer-based controller, makes navigation easy and convenient. Voice control integration through Alexa or Google Assistant further enhances ease of use.  **Lag: 9/10** For regular viewing, the TV has negligible input lag, making it perfect for sports, live TV, and movies. For gamers, input lag in Game Mode is remarkably low (around 12 ms), especially when connected via HDMI 2.1. This makes it one of the best TVs for console and PC gaming. There is no noticeable lag when using apps or navigating menus, ensuring a smooth and fluid user experience.  **Overall Rating: 9/10** The Sony Bravia stands out for its exceptional performance, particularly in picture quality, speed, and functionality. While it might not be the cheapest option, it delivers excellent value for those looking for a premium viewing experience, especially if you enjoy gaming or watching high-definition content. If ease of use and low lag are priorities, this TV won’t disappoint.",POSITIVE

"Never brought this TV from Amazon. The amazon courier service was very bad. 1st time they delay the service to deliver the TV due to late delivery I cancelled the order. I order it again for 2nd time. Then 2nd issue was they didn't give the installation service. My experience for order this TV through Amazon was bad.  But TCL TV was very good 👍. The picture, sound and features are awesome. It comes with Dolby Atmos, Dolby vision, Onkoy 2.1 sound subwoofer, HDR 10. The Google applications are performing very smoothly. I recommend to all TV lover please brought this TV to experience a great picture, sound and other features of TV.",POSITIVE
Best tv in price and size,POSITIVE
"I got faulty TV, IR receiver inside TV didn’t responded. I need to raise warranty service request but they responded with worst solutions, later they assigned technicians to fix it. Technician contacted me by saying that I need to pay him 450INR to come to my home and fix it. I asked him, why i need to pay when its under warranty, but he denied saying that TV company will give them only 150INR to do the job, which will not cover my petrol costs also. Then he warned me saying that if i am interested for that price he will come to do service else leave. I contacted customer care and reported the issue with Technician, they said he should not take any money, and from their side they also escalated the issue. No reply from anyone, so i contacted technician again and said will see after the job done about money, first visit. He came and tried to do something with remote but no use. So he left that day saying he will be back again. After 2 days he came and opened TV , there we can see clearly that IR receiver cable is not connected to board. Its simply a assembly issue in manufacturing. He just clipped it, it worked. He asked for 750rs , then i asked it its under warranty right why i need to pay but he denied. Then he argued a lot and took money. Such a Worst customer care by TCL.  One more thing is that Amazon misleading or miscommunication about the product, by displaying it as OLED Tv . I thought its OLED and purchased but its not Oled tv. I got cheated by amazon",NEGATIVE
"not a qled, no mention of qled in box. pixel density is bad looks pixeleted even in 4k from close , delivery was late, charged me another 1000 rupees, which is a scam it offers a 200rs mounting kit. If you ask them to reschedule they asked me to install on my own. They will just claim the warranty and leave. Other this works fine with the tv perticularly game mode makes a good smoothing.",NEGATIVE
Excellent,POSITIVE
"*Non-Biased review, read full and make your decision*  Size ordered: 43 Inches Price for which I bought: 23,262(Credit Card Discount Included) (For fitting of TV you have to contact LG by yourself, the installation is free you have to show the amazon invoice)  In-Box: TV, HDMI Cable, Stand Legs, Screws and Some Paper Work  Pros: - Really premium finish and build quality - Smooth UI - Best picture quality and colors under 30-35K range(Trust me) - Really good speakers - A reliable and good performing processor  Cons: - Not mentioned whether IPS or VA(my unit is IPS I guess) - Nothing else, everything worked fine for me (Will update if I find some issues in future)  Review: So the room where the TV is fitted is a living room, not too big not too small. The first impressions of TV were outstanding I mean the price that you are paying for the TV is clearly justified. Upgrading from smaller 32 inches TV the upgrade was kinda huge for me and I was stunned to see the 4K picture quality for first time.  Earlier I had a Sony Bravia TV and according to me sony gives the best picture quality a TV can give, but LG changed my mind. In just a few years the quality has improved drastically. The blacks are really good even in an IPS panel. Again I am not sure what panel it is, it's just and estimate.  The speakers are clearly more than enough for me. Like on full volume my floor sorts of vibrate, and I don't even have to bother about a sound bar anymore.  The SD channels, the quality they provide are really surprising. The upscaling has improved a lot and I can say you can enjoy SD channels on this TV too. And for HD channels, I don't have much to say but ""AMAZING"".  Earlier I was leaning towards other 43 inches TV's of Hisense and Acer, but spending some extra money to get LG was totally worth it. Other alternatives: Samsung Crystal 4k Series but I prefer LG after it's performance.  Totally recommend, you can buy this product.",POSITIVE
"It’s a nice big screen tv, this one is 55”, looks sturdy and well built, good quality full HD images and supports Dolby 5.1, good pixel ratio as well and was very easy to get wall mounted! The only cons I’d say is that it comes with a moveable adjustable wall mount stand, but it’s a little too tight and difficult to move front and back, but is easy when moved sideways; and the response time sometimes is usually slow for certain actions. Unique remote, if you want the remote seen in the above video then you gotta select the magic remote option while selecting the variant. The TV can also be controlled entirely through your phone via the LG ThinQ app, has all Options exactly like it’s remote. Worth the price, got it at a deal.",POSITIVE
"Just purchased this bad boy and I couldn't be happier! The picture quality is stunning, with realistic to vibrant colors that make every scene immersive.  AUDIO- • The sound is immersive and comes with different modes to focus on dialogues or cinematic sound, delivering clear and loud audio that fills the room. I just need 45-50 % audio to hear each element clearly.  FEATURE • Navigating through the smart features is a breeze, thanks to the magic remote ( which I paid extra 2400rs for the installation guy). Although this caused the tv to run fast which causes lag sometimes. Magic remote also gives you additional features which is not possible with the simple remote.  DISPLAY- •The colours are close to realistic . And you can select how you want to view what you're watching with different colour modes. There's also a gaming mode for play station ( I don't own one yet so I'm going to add the review when I'm purchasing it  Overall, this TV offers fantastic value for its price. I purchased this for 26K (The one which I purchased is 43 inches and I got the Wall mount for free which was worth 500rs )",POSITIVE

"* Amazon delivered early morning * Installation done on the same day, knowledgeable service person * Review based on 2 months usage  Why I chose Panasonic? Nothing special, I still have my 13yr old 32 inch Panasonic TV running fine. So I wanted to buy same brand once again :D  PROs * Nice picture and sound quality. I upgraded from a older Panasonic 720p TV, so * OS is faster most of the times. I don't see much of a difference compared to the basic firestick. * Nice smart Remote with minimal keys * The wall mount coming with the TV is enough this TV. But it is recommended to buy a generic mount if there are any plans to upgrade in near future. * Connecting to WIFI and Bluetooth devices works fine.  CONs * OS lags some times when multiple apps are opened. So this is purely based on usage. * TV audio is ok but recommend to have a soundbar or something  Haven't tested ethernet connectivity, will update once done  Note : Recommended to get an external stabilizer",NEGATIVE
"The speed of processor is very slow. The remote goes stuck every few seconds..cant watch TV peacefully... It's like being using old age phone in this era.... The memory of the TV was written 16 gb in description but the memory is only 8gb total... It's showing 7.8 gb total... Available after apps of TV (in built) is 4.8 GB... I was expecting atleast that you don't lie AMAZON. Overall, I'm not happy what I got... Only good part is screen... It's good",NEGATIVE
Picture quality is excellent. As a basic TV it's easy to use. Overall a great TV.,POSITIVE
Good product,POSITIVE
"The TV itself is good, and I’ve owned TCL products before without issues. However, purchasing high-value items from Amazon comes with serious risks due to their poor post-purchase support.  Installation was repeatedly delayed, and despite multiple follow-ups, no resolution was provided. Customer support was unprofessional, unhelpful, and unwilling to take ownership of the issue. I ultimately had to return the product—not because of TCL, but due to Amazon’s failure to provide the necessary service.  If you’re considering buying expensive electronics here, be prepared for a frustrating experience if you ever need support.",NEGATIVE
Good quality for this price. If u choose other brands you have to pay ₹5000 to 15000 extra .,POSITIVE
"I bought TCL 75 inches 4K UHD LED TV after lot of research on specifications and price bargain.  This TV is really a catch @ Rs 69,990 when I bought in December 2023. Great deal on 75 inches TV. Thanks to TCL.  Moreover, the colours and brightness and viewing pleasure is really very satisfactory.  I was dreaming to buy Mini LED TV but it was very costly and out of my budget. So I closed down on this great value for money deal on TCL 75 inches giant screen TV at an amazing price tag of Rs 69,990.  Sound is 30W RMS. It's really crystal clear and very good to listen each minute audio detail. I have a soundbar but now no need to use it as the TV sound is almost like a soundbar and it's powerful.  TV has got HDMI eARC connectivity. I am using soundbar as well as Sony wireless headphone L600 - both with eARC connectivity. So it was super easy to connect my soundbar as well as wireles headphone with TCL TV seamlessly.  The remote controller unit is also very nice. It's bit slim and long which looks different from other brands and easy to handle. All required shortcut buttons are given.  It's a Google TV. So supports Google voice search.  We are very happy on our decision to buy TCL 75 inches 4K UHD TV.  I hope this TV will serve us for few years to come without any technical problems. I will post my post use feedback soon in next year 2024.  Thank you.",POSITIVE
TCL is affordable price very good picture quality this TV equal samsung & Sony viewing experience,POSITIVE
Quality is very good.,POSITIVE
"We bought the TV 3 months back. In a month, the TV started getting hanged and did not work smoothly. Even after following all the instructions, the problem didn't get solved. Also the after service of the company is pathetic. When we asked to replace the product, they denied and did made reasons like technician will come and check the product. It's been more than 20 days we are trying to reach th but no one is responding to our complaint. Also the customer care number that is mentioned is of no use as no one answered or addressed our complaint. There is Lag, poor picture quality before the TV started getting hanged. And now TV is not working at all. It's stuck on TCL logo and keeping getting restart, doesn't go ahead of it. Never buy or go for TCL products as they don't respond or replace the product even when it's in the warranty period.  Just because it's less price, don't buy it as money gets wasted. Better to put extra and buy another brand.",NEGATIVE
Nice tv but it do not come with wall Mount,NEGATIVE
"This TV offers excellent picture quality with vibrant colors and sharp 4K resolution. Sound is also clear .The smart features are intuitive, with a responsive interface but a limited app store due to the OS. Its sleek design and ample connectivity options are also strong points. it's a solid choice for those seeking a high-quality TV at a reasonable price. Would recommend, especially for casual viewers.",POSITIVE
I have been using this tv since last 3 months and its the best tv anyone can consider at this price range with best 4k gaming features and quality output. It provides great colour and audio quality is also perfect over all sound effects - consist with good function and all expected and used ports - vidaa os is very smooth and with updates i think will provide better options - brightness over 70% feels very adequate and perfect  overall can be considered as the best 4k gaming tv with good refresh rate in budget range of 50-60k,POSITIVE
"Only thing that this tv lacked was the OS(not google/android). But after 3 months I think hisense own OS ""Vida"" is way faster,snappy. Casting your laptop or android phone has no lag. Also has airplay.  Specs are near perfect [in Q3/2024]. Speakers 40wt is good enough. I rarely turn on my home theater unless I neeed that Booom in my living room. Sound is enough to fill a big indian living room.  Only negative: google has more apps. Vida is adding apps but they need pick up some pace. They have all the basic apps you would need. You can run any video audio format via usb. No need to install video players. In jan 2025 these apps as available: Netflix,youtube, disneyplus, prime, sony, zee5, apply, crunchy roll, jio cinema, yupptv.  Most of the other are not for India region. No VPN app that I could find.  Conclusion: worth your money, perfect specs, needs more india based apps, no issues with PS5 or Ps4.",POSITIVE
"This is my second Hisense TV purchase, and I am very pleased once again. The picture quality is excellent. The sound quality is impressive considering the slim build of the TV; the subwoofer is decent, providing enough bass, though it doesn’t quite match the depth of a dedicated subwoofer. So you'll have to go for external speakers if you want that extra thump.  This TV has a lot of features, many of which I haven't tested yet. The Vidaa OS operates smoothly, but the downside with it not being an android/Google TV is the limited availability of apps. I'm a Spotify subscriber and I often listen to music on my old Hisense android tv which seamlessly connects with spotify, but this TV doesn't, which is disappointing. And if you have a Hotstar Premium subscription, you won’t be able to watch content in 4K on this TV for some reason, it only goes upto 1080p. However, I have paired this TV with a Jio STB, so I don't rely on the built-in apps much.  Overall, it’s a very good TV if you primarily want to enjoy your TV channels and some OTT apps.  I'd give it a solid 4.5/5 ⭐",POSITIVE
"I owned a Hisense Television which I was really happy with, and that encouraged me to choose Hisense while I was looking for a bigger size. And with all honesty, I can say that this one's even better. Picture, Sound, Built, even the viewing angles are excellent. Perfect TV at justifyable price",POSITIVE
"The Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers an excellent combination of performance, features, and value. With a large 65-inch screen, it delivers crisp 4K resolution, vibrant colors, and decent contrast. The picture quality is solid for the price, making it a great choice for those who want an affordable yet high-performing TV for watching movies, TV shows, or gaming.  The smart features are intuitive and easy to use, thanks to its Android TV platform, which provides access to a wide variety of streaming services, apps, and built-in voice control with Google Assistant. The TV supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, offering an enhanced viewing experience with deeper blacks and brighter highlights.  In terms of design, the Hisense 65-inch TV has a sleek and modern look, with slim bezels that allow for a more immersive viewing experience. The sound quality is decent, but for an enhanced audio experience, pairing it with an external soundbar or home theater system might be a good idea.  Connectivity options are solid, with multiple HDMI ports, USB inputs, and Wi-Fi support, making it easy to hook up your devices.  Overall, the Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers impressive value for its price, delivering great picture quality, user-friendly smart features, and a modern design. It’s a solid option for anyone looking for a large, budget-friendly smart TV.",POSITIVE
Im super impressed by this tv. Amazing quality crisp sound and video. Lets hope it has longetivity! For now definetly worth every rupee,POSITIVE
"Bought this Q7N Tornado in August 2024. Review after 4 months :- Problem : bright colors causes eye strain. I even tried cinema mode, film maker mode, energy saving mode, standard mode of video but the eyes pain / eyes feel tired after watching the TV from 10-12 feet distance for 1 to 2 hours.  Benefits: Very good picture quality and clarity. 4k is very nice but too bright. Sound quality is very good nothing negative there. Connectivity options are good hdmi, usb, Bluetooth WiFi all connect very well. Vida OS is awesome no lag so far and I need only few apps like Netflix, prime, YouTube, hotstar ,zee5, sonyliv. All these apps are sufficient.  Since the screen is smooth, if you have tubelight or light or window directly opposite face to the TV then you see the reflection/glare of that tubelight or window sun light. Need to make the room darker by curtains or off the tubelight to remove its glare. I wish the screen was with matt anti-glare finishing.  Atleast I hope the company puts out some video settings recommendations to reduce eye strain for watching this TV. My old Samsung LCD 32 inch screen was better and caused no eye strain.",POSITIVE
good quality for a good price,POSITIVE
"Multiple options of audio/video input/output. I can connect my Bluetooth headphones to it. Picture quality is great. Can control with phone via App. Some was saying that it is a bit slow to respond, I don't feel so. View angles are great, colour stays same at any direction. It's worth it money. Using it for 5 months so far.",POSITIVE
"BEST VALUE FOR MONEY, KEPT SEARCHING FOR 6 MONTHS, AND WHEN I PURCHASED IT, I WAS SO SCARED TO REGRET IT!  AND NOW AFTER COUPLE OF MONTHS I CAN CONFIRM I DID NOT REGRET IT! I USE IT ONLY TO WATCH CARTOON FOR KIDS AND ME STREAMING. I HAVE A CHROME CAST, BUT NO LONGER USING IT THE SOFTWARE IS STABLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME USE IT DIRECTLY AND NO CHROME CAST LIKE MY OLD TV  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,",NEGATIVE
"It's worth the price, i realy like this TV E7k 55""!!!picture quality,the tv speaker,for gaming ps5 with 60hz native.hiw fast to navigate on the homescreen.like they say, i recommend this TV with good features that will not break the bank.. But if you have budget for qled like this with 144hz go for it. But for me, from my 7 y/o LG 59"" its a great upgrade and i am satisfied with this TV.",POSITIVE
good in evry thing except it is vivid system not open app sestem program no way to add any app out of vivid stor,NEGATIVE
"Background : I was in search for a good but not pricey TV because of the following  1. My Samsung 49"" K6300 Curved TV had gone kaput in 4-5 years (DOP - Somewhere in 2017 - early 2018) 2. I was dragging my old TV with ever growing shadows accompanied with visibility issues. 3. K6300 was an eye pleasure when in good condition with amazing blacks and motion smoothness - beautiful out of the box colors.  Since a Tier 1 brand like Samsung had betrayed the trust after paying a premium , I was in the lookout of a mid range TV with up-to-date features - my check list included the following  1. Solid warranty clause with no Money extorsion policies like LG OLED post 1 year end. 2. Good sound system - Preferably with a sub-woofer. 3. Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.  I think I am tending to increase ratings from 4 to 5 stars. Just for the REGZA Pic & Sound from Toshiba.  Good and durable Japanese brands Like Sanyo, Toshiba, Panasonic ( that bring in proprietary tech) should be endorsed (even thought they may be manufactured locally under strategic partnerships) by the Indians else everything is gonna be PRC/Korea Inspired.",POSITIVE
"Initially I want to buy infinix qled t.v because of earlier experience with the brand was good moreover it was 8000 Rs economical to Toshiba but I switch over to Toshiba because of brand reputation most of the well-known brands like infinix,Motorola,Kodak,Blaupunkt, Thomson etc. used to market third party manufacturers product though I am not certain Toshiba manufacturer this t.v or it is also playing the same game but I take a bet because of goodwill and three years of warranty which no other brand is providing.I have been using the t.v for three months I have following observations about this t.v- 1-Picture quality is great (Good contrast,Punchy colours, Wide colour gamut,No screen bleeding issues,Deeper black level) can be good or at par with brands like Samsung,LG, Panasonic inferior to Sony) so there is no comparison with other brands they will fall short. 2- Toshiba's proprietary Regza chip is damm fast as well as do best upscaling moreover it's own ui makes it fast in comparison to android t.v's present in the market don't compare it's ram and rom because it can do it's work swiftly in comparision with brands having double ram and rom nodoubt because of rom storage can be issue for some. 3- Sound quality is great to me it varies person to person vocals are clear and crisp, lacking bass and surround experience is great.sound is pleasing in most of scenarios like 4k movies, webseries,games,news, loudness is sufficient for room 12×15 size of room is at par with Samsung and LG t.v's of this size. 4- settings menu is easily operable, build quality is good,great aesthetics with well built functional remote. Can be improved -. 1- Bass 2-behaves like va panel so viewing angles are not that great but not that much colour shift is seen. After one month see my video review of this t.v on my YouTube channel shobhits exact evaluation .",POSITIVE
"I've had this TV now for near 4 months. The positives are that the build quality, picture quality & sound quality are all great. The only two negatives are the OS & the lack of Filmmaker mode. So I recommend getting a FireTV device or a similar device to remedy the OS issue; the lack of Filmmaker mode means you will need to manually adjust the picture quality to give you the best viewing experience possible. Having said this the TV is still a very good buy at the price.",POSITIVE
"Good sound quality , good build quality , clear display No lagging. . . . . . . . . .",POSITIVE
"Purchased this tv in July 2024 and after using it for around 5 months now, I can say that it's a really good TV. After doing so much research I finalized this tv over other brands like Sony samsung lg TCL acer etc. others are offering similar features at higher price. But this tv came in just around 20.5k.  Pros: - Best picture quality - looks premium in the room - most amazing part is sound is loud, clear and balanced. Never faced audio issues like other TVs. In other TVs either music is good but not loud enough or bass is too much that you can't watch movies with clear sound. We were thinking of having speakers and hometheater but dropped that idea after having this tv as the sound is good, loud and best - installation was quick and easy - UI is really good. Never hangs even while playing Dolby vision 4k HD videos - Gets regular software updates - remote is sleek and has better button replacement than other tv remotes - customer care called me after 2 months to take my feedback about tv. Such things don't exist in today's world. Felt good that customer care actually cares  I had already used or seen mi tv(parents have one), redmi tv(brother have one), acer tv(friend has this), sony tv(cousin has this), TCL tv(another friend has this), OnePlus tv(one friend has this). , so I had experience with tvs of all these companies... They have issues like low sound, bad picture quality, software hanging, tv getting slow after a few months even if updated etc.... after enough comparisons and experience I can say that Kodak tv is best and worth the amount you spend.  Go for this tv if on low budget like me. It's worth every penny.",POSITIVE
"Awesome sturdiness, easy to use, clear pictures, odisha sound. But overall value for money",POSITIVE
"I’ve been using this budget-friendly Android TV for over a year now, and it has been a great experience overall. The picture quality has remained sharp, and the performance is consistent with smooth app functionality and minimal lag. It’s impressive how reliable this TV has been for the price!  That said, the remote has been a bit of a challenge—it stopped working properly a few months ago. Fortunately, the TV’s mobile app has been a lifesaver, offering a seamless remote control alternative.  For the price, this TV delivers excellent value, and despite the minor remote issue, I would still recommend it for anyone looking for an affordable smart TV option.",POSITIVE
"Good TV . I have been using from last 6months and no issues. Picture and sound quality is good. Easy to use Netflix, prime video you tube . And other Apps.",POSITIVE

Good tv best buy for this money range with multiple features with good quality picture quality is normal sound clarity finds me well over all build quality can be improved with fit and finish value for money,POSITIVE
"Toshiba TVs are known for their exceptional picture quality and impressive performance. The vibrant colors, sharp details, and smooth motion make the viewing experience truly enjoyable. Whether you're watching movies, sports, or playing games, the display quality never fails to impress. Additionally, the sound clarity and build quality reflect Toshiba's commitment to excellence. Overall, it's a great choice for anyone looking for a premium yet affordable TV. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Toshiba 55-inch TV and I must say, I am extremely impressed with the overall performance and quality of this product. The picture quality is outstanding, with vibrant colors and sharp details that make watching movies and TV shows a truly immersive experience. The sound quality is also top-notch, providing clear and crisp audio that enhances the viewing experience.  I appreciate the sleek and modern design of it ,which looks great in my living room and adds a touch of elegance to the space. The setup was quick and easy, and the user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it a breeze to navigate through different settings and apps.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. It has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, design, and features. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a high-quality viewing experience at an affordable price. Thank you, Toshiba, for delivering such a fantastic product!",POSITIVE
Giveing review after 1 month of use Pros- Overally video and audio Clearity is awesome. Value for money. Cons- In high moving object like while watching cricket observe when ball moves faster it gets blur some time it's seems 2-3 ball are moves faster back to back like that. In short MEMC not provided or not working properly. But it's not big issue,POSITIVE
"The performance of the Toshiba TV is excellent! The picture quality is vibrant, the sound is crisp, and the overall experience has been great. However, the installation process could have been better. While the setup was completed, one side of the TV is slightly tilted down, which was a bit disappointing.  Despite this minor issue, the TV itself delivers an outstanding viewing experience, and I’m very satisfied with the product. Highly recommend it for its performance!",POSITIVE
"The TV is awsome, very nice picture quality and dolby atmos is too good. At this price point you can't ask for more. Yes in comparison to all Android tv this is a bit slow but faster than the rest.  Important part- I read many negative comments or reviews regarding installation failure. The same happened with me, however with constant communication with Amazon they helped me to get the tv installed within the scheduled time. Yes if you are polite enough anyone will help you out.  There are reviews regarding the tv shutting down itself after some time. The same thing happened with me. But it's a energy saving feature of the TV, if you keep it in idle condition it will shutdown. That is a good feature. But illeterate consumers doesn't understand nor study the manual before posting such reviews. It's an awsome tv go for it",NEGATIVE
"TV is a good buy at this price point. Picture quality could have been better, sound is clear and loud. Overall a nice tv.",POSITIVE
"Positives: overall good performance, 2 years of warranty.  Negatives: White light bleeding at the edges of screen very clearly visible in grey screen.",NEGATIVE
"At this price range this is the only TV maybe which has 2 GB RAM, others come at 1 or 1.5 GB RAM. So as a Smart TV you are able to get a glitch free interface.",NEGATIVE

"At present the screen has several greyish colour spots on the screen. I should have checked it with a simple test : white wallpaper image or white video. I was able to confirm this issue in February-March 2023. I contacted Hisense. Their service team or whoever they have outsourced the service job to is poor. When the TV was under ""manufacturer's warranty"" this greyish issue was not resolved. But after a long time and several attempts this issue which began in February 2023 has finally been resolved in December 2023. Note that it might have been a pre-existing issue but the fact is that I noticed and was able to make sure that it was definitely an issue in February 2023. And again - to be specific - issue has not been resolved but I have been adequately compensated financially by the 3rd party insurance company. As per the service team associated with the insurance company the grey spots repair was not possible due to location, cost prohibitive, etc reasons therefore the insurance company refunded the amount (after deducting the service charges, depreciation, etc). So yes, issue has been resolved in that way which is also okay\good.  The TV screen was packed and delivered with protection using ample plastic lamination. There were 4 different protective lamination in front. There was one big lamination which covered the main screen. Then there were 2 lamination like tapes to hold this main lamination. Then there was one lamination which covered the Hisense brand name panel which is located at the bottom of the screen.  The volume control bar is 100% opaque. It is bright, white and 100% opaque and spoils the view. Moreover, when I try to change volume then this volume bar appears at the middle bottom of the screen. It is not helpful because it completely obscures the subtitles/captions and various other on screen texts/images. This volume bar is TV's system feature or perhaps it is an Android 11 feature. Location of the volume bar should be on the left or right of the screen not bottom. Else, they should have provided an option to change the transparency of the volume bar.  When this TV is about to go to standby it shows a black pop-up in the middle of the screen with the countdown timer. There is no way to cancel or snooze this timer at that moment. So it is not helpful especially if you are watching something important. TV will turn off to standby and you can't do anything about it at that moment.  The location, size, shape, etc of the mute button on the remote is not good at all. Mute button should be of a unique shape. It should be bigger than other buttons and easier to access. Button has been placed in the middle of all buttons which makes it difficult to access it conveniently/ immediately if you are watching something in dark.  I had a Sony LCD TV before. It had an excellent feature of keeping the screen off while audio was still on. It was a very helpful feature. This feature is not available in this TV.  Moreover, the Sony TV had another very useful feature which this TV doesn't have. The display area settings. There were 3 options in the display area settings in the Sony TV viz +1, 0, and -1 which were very helpful. This feature isn't available in this TV.  Options of screensaver timer are few and fixed eg 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc. I wish it was possible to set the screensaver timer of my choice eg 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, etc minutes.  In the Play Store app the installed apps often don't update even after several manual attempts let alone auto update. This is not good.  The OS is Android 11 and still there is no dark mode feature in the TV.  There should be a page up/down feature in the remote. This feature is needed quite often in various apps to browse through various genres, titles, etc. Tapping the up, down, left , right, etc keys repeatedly only to move between titles one by one requires a lot of effort and is a waste of time. It also causes hardware damage because the up, down, left, right, etc keys will wear off quickly and I'll have to buy a new remote soon.  I was focused on so many other features, prices, etc that while making a decision to buy this TV I totally forgot about confirming the energy rating before placing the order. When I placed the order nowhere was it mentioned on Amazon that it has only a 3 star energy rating. I am disappointed with this. I found out that this TV has only a 3 star energy rating after I received the delivery. The energy rating is mentioned on the sticker attached to the protective plastic lamination on the TV screen.  I had a very bad wall mount installation experience with the service company associated with this TV brand but that's a different and a long story and I guess will not be appreciated if I include that in this review.  There are several options in TV Options. One of which is the picture option. In this picture option there is a very helpful option called display mode. This display mode has 6 options. One of which is a 4:3 aspect ratio which is indeed very helpful. But unfortunately there is no option to zoom the video if you have selected this 4:3 aspect ratio. Due to which there are a lot of empty black spaces (black bars) on all 4 sides of the video. These bars or empty spaces are absolutely all right. But I also need to see the 4:3 videos in zoomed in / zoomed out mode sometimes. So an additional setting of zoom in and zoom out ""after"" selecting 4:3 display mode would have been terrific. Wish they had also included a 7th option of cinema aspect ratio ie 2.39:1 in the picture option. There is no aspect ratio above 16:9.  There are 7 modes in picture mode. If you try to change picture mode then there will be a pop-up warning saying ""this option may result in higher energy consumption"". Now amongst these 7 modes there is an ENERGY SAVING mode also. It is surprising that when you try to select this mode the same pop-up warning appears. This is contradictory. How can selecting energy saving mode result in higher energy consumption?  The home screen interface is not easy to use. The selected item or title should be prominent or conspicuous e.g. the selected item should be surrounded by a white / coloured outline so that it is easy to decipher which item is currently under selection. At present the selected item just gets a little bigger which is often difficult to distinguish from other items.  There is no option to download movies, shows, etc in any app unlike mobile phones, tablets, etc. There is no download option at all even in major apps such as Netflix, Amazon prime video, YouTube etc to watch something when offline. This is unexpected and disappointing.  I have a Bluetooth version 4.2 headphones. I could not find the Bluetooth version of the TV mentioned anywhere in the TV. I could not find the Bluetooth version of the tablet mentioned anywhere in the tablet either. The only info available in the tablet is that the Bluetooth AVRCP version is 1.4. The Bluetooth version of the tablet is probably 4.2 as per the information available on the tablet company / brand website. So anyway, I have already paired the headphones with this TV and the tablet. I usually connect headphones either with the tablet or this TV. Now if the headphones are already connected with the tablet and not with TV and then if I disconnect the headphones from the tablet (by switching off the Bluetooth of the tablet) then the headphones should automatically connect with TV. But that doesn't happen. I have to reboot the headphones so that it can automatically connect to TV.  While watching the new The Invisible Man movie (most probably on Netflix app) the visual experience was not good. The movie features a lot of greyish / dark / night scenes. These scenes looked blurry / unclear as if some sort of fog or vapour was floating on the screen. It appears that this TV is not very efficient in displaying true deep darkness in these types of scenes.  Remote often doesn't work efficiently or effectively when casting or screen mirroring e.g. it takes several attempts / pressing the up, down, left right, etc keys of the remote control before the progress bar appears on the TV screen. Progress bar is a basic necessity nowadays so that one could fast forward or fast backward a video.  If I am not mistaken, nowhere on the product page on Amazon or the TV package is mentioned that a wall mount bracket set will be provided. Moreover, there is no mention of the list of all the parts in the wall bracket set pack. There were 8 items in total. Or 1+2+2+2+2+3+3+4=19 individual pieces in total if you count the number of pieces in each item. Or 1+2+2+2+2+3+15+4=31 individual parts in total if you count every part of each piece e.g. each expansive bolt is made up of 5 parts. They should have mentioned this list on the box or on a paper or manual or somewhere appropriate.  I don't know why these brands don't recommend or provide a screen cleaning kit.  You can switch between wall hanging and tabletop mode yourself. You just need to attach the 2 tripod stands using regular screwdrivers. Screws and stands are provided with the TV. But table top stand mode is not satisfactory because it is unstable even on smooth straight surfaces.. TV wobbles when it is on the two tripod stands which- needless to mention - is precarious.  I have paired this TVs Bluetooth with my Moto g04 Android 14 smartphone Bluetooth several times. I wanted to use smartphone as remote control. But this TV keeps disappearing from the phone's Bluetooth list. Hisense support says TV won't pair with phone. Phone support says talk to Hisense.  Conclusion : Not satisfactory. Therefore - overall - after considering everything I rate this TV 2⭐ or 4/10. Since submitting 2.5 STARS is not possible here on Amazon therefore i have no option but to rate it 2 stars. I find it very difficult to rate it 3 stars because to me 3 stars stand for a faultless but good (or average) product (or service).",NEGATIVE
"The product is good built and picture quality is good. 4K videos played nicely. Sound output is also very nice Installation support was good, folks came on time and installed without any issues",POSITIVE
"Good quality TV. Well built and stylish. Good brightness and contrast especially considering the price. No lag noticed while viewing regular TV programs or cricket. Viewing OTT from Amazon prime, Disney etc is a breeze. Android boot up is a bit slow as compared to high end brands like Sony and Samsung but no problems once it is up and running. Best value proposition and having all the features as per latest technology. Excellent picture and sound quality . If you are looking for a premium TV at the very best price, then go for it without a secondary thought  NATWAR SINGH",POSITIVE
"I face some issue with this tv sometimes tv off automatically, lag in os and sound clearty issue It's average.",NEGATIVE
"Value For Money, Picture Clarity & Sound Quality Is Really Really Awesome Really I Liked This Product Quality Of Product is No.1 Installation Is Also Very Simple Size & Design Altimate.",POSITIVE
"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE
Samsung products are good. Installation service is also good. Performance and display quality is very best. Really value for money. I bought this with the brand name.,POSITIVE
Go for it without any doubt 👍,POSITIVE
"Bought model of 2023 where 2024 model was already launched after comparing both I did not find any specific difference and 2023 model was available at 1000₹ additional discount so bought this. Initially i was planning to go for an google tv but this TV comes with 2 years warranty for Panel, so i changed my mind The panel if it stops working will almost cost you 50% of the original Tv so considering this additional warranty made my mind Storage is 8 Gb which definitely is low but all 32 inch tvs come with same storage capacity so no choice here Also Fire TV UI is lighter so lags are low as compared to Google or android TV Color quality and picture is perfect, can be viewed from all angles, wall mount is not part of the original packing and have to be bought separately. Sound is good and also the remote is simple and easy to use, got an update for the tv after buying, the only issue with this is network reception, it clearly requires a very strong wifi network any thing less then that the UI stucks, and at 50% network it won't work at all Phone is showing network and can be used to stream videos but for this tv it's no signal, so make sure you have a strong network where ever you install this.",NEGATIVE
Very good and excellent in the price range,POSITIVE
Best Telivision in this segment. Also available in very lowest price. Service provided by MI store is excellent,POSITIVE
"This TV uses Fire TV from Amazon and the battery of the remote dies down very quickly. I have to buy new batteries for almost every week. I even tried using the Android App to use as remote, but that app doesn't remember the connection, it would solve my remote draining problem If I could use the app forever. Anyways the TV as a TV is great, good picture quality, nice sound quality as well.",NEGATIVE
I am writing this review after just 3 days of usage. Product received earlier and come up with Good packaging. And then technician came after two days of delivery for installation. The picture Quality:- As per my view the picture Quality is good. This TV came up with HD Ready 720p resolution but you can play 1080p resolution Video on YouTube and picture Quality looks stunning seems like Full HD Video. Sound Quality:- This TV came up with Decent Sound Quality Not upto The Mark. Build Quality:- Good Note:- if you watch the TV from left or Right Side angle you will see Fade in Picture Quality. Watching From front will give you good Picture Quality.,POSITIVE

"Purchased this tv in July 2024 and after using it for around 5 months now, I can say that it's a really good TV. After doing so much research I finalized this tv over other brands like Sony samsung lg TCL acer etc. others are offering similar features at higher price. But this tv came in just around 20.5k.  Pros: - Best picture quality - looks premium in the room - most amazing part is sound is loud, clear and balanced. Never faced audio issues like other TVs. In other TVs either music is good but not loud enough or bass is too much that you can't watch movies with clear sound. We were thinking of having speakers and hometheater but dropped that idea after having this tv as the sound is good, loud and best - installation was quick and easy - UI is really good. Never hangs even while playing Dolby vision 4k HD videos - Gets regular software updates - remote is sleek and has better button replacement than other tv remotes - customer care called me after 2 months to take my feedback about tv. Such things don't exist in today's world. Felt good that customer care actually cares  I had already used or seen mi tv(parents have one), redmi tv(brother have one), acer tv(friend has this), sony tv(cousin has this), TCL tv(another friend has this), OnePlus tv(one friend has this). , so I had experience with tvs of all these companies... They have issues like low sound, bad picture quality, software hanging, tv getting slow after a few months even if updated etc.... after enough comparisons and experience I can say that Kodak tv is best and worth the amount you spend.  Go for this tv if on low budget like me. It's worth every penny.",POSITIVE
"Awesome sturdiness, easy to use, clear pictures, odisha sound. But overall value for money",POSITIVE
"I’ve been using this budget-friendly Android TV for over a year now, and it has been a great experience overall. The picture quality has remained sharp, and the performance is consistent with smooth app functionality and minimal lag. It’s impressive how reliable this TV has been for the price!  That said, the remote has been a bit of a challenge—it stopped working properly a few months ago. Fortunately, the TV’s mobile app has been a lifesaver, offering a seamless remote control alternative.  For the price, this TV delivers excellent value, and despite the minor remote issue, I would still recommend it for anyone looking for an affordable smart TV option.",POSITIVE
"Good TV . I have been using from last 6months and no issues. Picture and sound quality is good. Easy to use Netflix, prime video you tube . And other Apps.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this TV, and it has exceeded my expectations! The picture quality is decent, the features are impressive, and it's undoubtedly the best value-for-money product in this price range. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Very Good. Worth the money. Picture clarity, sound and built quality of the Is awesome. Totally satisfied",POSITIVE
Tv is good and reasonable but wall mount we have to purchased separately and costs 3500 rs Otherwise installation team was good 👍,NEGATIVE
Good tv best buy for this money range with multiple features with good quality picture quality is normal sound clarity finds me well over all build quality can be improved with fit and finish value for money,POSITIVE
"I replaced a 12-year-old Sony Bravia LED TV with this one. In these 12 years, LED has evolved to QLED and then to OLED, but I was unprepared for the step jump in quality. I compared this TV's picture quality in showrooms with a Sony Bravia XR OLED costing 40,000 more, and with an LG OLED costing 70,000 less. The LG picture quality was visibly less clear, had lower detail, lower contrast, than this one, and the Sony Bravia XR was more or less comparable to this one. So I think this TV is more or less state of the art in OLED TV for 2023.  Note that this model is the S95C series. There's an S90C of the same size which costs 40,000 less and has slightly lower brightness and doesn't have the connection box. The connection box is one of the greatest features of this S95C. It eliminates the clutter of twenty different cables hanging off the TV.  The image quality is outstanding. I knew that OLED TVs were great, but I now know that there are quality differences among even OLED TVs, and this one's colour brightness, contrast, lack of spillage of lights from the brightest white subtitles being shown on inky black backgrounds, are all outstanding.  The build is amazingly thin. It fits flatter against the wall compared to most other TVs. One of the reasons it can do this is because all its connections are drawn away from the main panel to the connection box which sits in my audio rack.  The sound quality is nothing to write home about. I guess all modern super-slim TVs are disappointing in this area. Anyway, the sound quality of TVs has never mattered to me -- I've always found TVs to have horrible sound. This TV's sound is no better than my 12-year-old Sony, maybe even a shade worse. I always play all TV sound through my audio system, so it's never mattered.  One side effect of getting this large TV with outstanding brightness, clarity and contrast, is that I can no more watch my old DVD videos. The minimum resolution I need now is Bluray or full HD. DVD videos look too grainy. This is the flip side of quality step jump I guess.",NEGATIVE
The TV performs well and love the realistic image that is generated. Sound is surprising good considering the flat panel. Seller was also prompt in arranging delivery and post-sales demo etc,POSITIVE
Nice tv I am purchasing in local off line shop ₹117000/-only sound quality is awesome. Picture quality is great too,POSITIVE
I purchase this TV from reliance and bubble shown in TV with in 3 days...Struggling for replacement.As compare undoubt Sony is best.,NEGATIVE
"I purchased QA65S95DAULXL from reliance digital offline store for INR 189700- There is too much hype created about this product, looks like artificial. Previously I purchased 6 series budget tv for INR 55k two years back. I am still struggling to find as to what is major upgrade. Please view the tv before placing order at this artificially hiked price. One connect box and stand they claim as upgrade cripple the use of tv.",NEGATIVE
"TV is gorgeous till it works (S95D, 55 inch) but in 15 days, bubbles appeared on screen which look bad and are an eyesore. Be fully aware that these panels are badly built with no quality control. If you are willing to risk your money, go ahead.  EDIT: After intervention of seller, Reliance digital, panel has been replaced under warranty. Hoped this would've been more prompt from.Samsung. but after change, TV is working beautifully. Picture quality is awesome. Built in sound is ok-ish, as expected from tiny speakers. (mind it, TV is just 11 mm thin piece of art). Paired with Yamaha YAS209 sound bar, this tv has brought Theater in my room. Loving it at the moment. Can watch it all day with lights on and windows open without bothersome reflections. One star is reduced in rating due to Samsung's post sales handling.",POSITIVE
"Great TV, amazing screen and PS5 works amazingly well. Screen is thinner than my pinky finger. Got it for 1.23 lacs from Reliance Digital.",POSITIVE
"Offline price 65inch just 1,60,000 why the difference on line price it's sales big problem Okkkkk kkkkk ok ok ok",NEGATIVE
"We have a 50 inch LG UR7500 tv, and are quite happy with the overall quality and performance. However, we recently got the Sony ht a3000 set (subwoofer + rear speakers) and since then were considering getting a slightly larger Bravia tv within a certain budget. We finalized the 82l 55 inch one and got a good overall deal thanks to Amazon and the HDFC credit card (with no cost emi it and bank discount cost us around 66k).  Pros- - picture quality and colour representation - excellent for movies on OTT - Sony Bravia Core subscription with 5 credits- watched the Amazing Spiderman and was blown away by the quality - sound (although we are mostly using the home theatre set, so the tv sound isn’t used as much) - tv remote- just the right set of buttons and features - Google tv- despite my personal choice of Android over Google tv, I don’t have any complaints here - UI and tv’s settings+ features are easy to use and have some good accessibility additions - build quality- great - installation support- superb and timely (the professional helped us shift and setup our existing 50 inch LG tv to a different room)  Cons - 60 hz refresh rate, so avid gamers may want to upgrade to a 120hz display - audio center sync not compatible, which was a bummer for me. However, a compromise that I’ve made considering the budget - some of the apps like Sony Liv work with a delay, which otherwise work fine on my other tv. Could be because of Google Tv OS  Overall verdict- for our use- daily soaps, serials and marathon binge watching on Netflix + Movies on OTT, it’s an excellent, value for money purchase with superb compatibility with the Sony audio system(s). Good with gaming, could have done with 120hz which is the only real life scenario miss.",NEGATIVE
It's my 4 months review. Before buying I researched all top brand like Samsung qled & LG qned but sony is always on top. It's colour reproduction and sound quality is top notch. Even full HD also looks closer to 4k. Actually it is better than bravia 3. Bravia 3 makes picture more saturated which is slightly irritated while in x82L you see natural colour. Hence after long screen time you still enjoy it. Just go for it... 🤙🤙,POSITIVE
"Recently purchased a Sony 4K TV, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. The picture quality is outstanding, delivering sharp, vibrant, and true-to-life colors that enhance my viewing experience. The sound quality is equally impressive, with clear, immersive audio that complements the stunning visuals.  What makes this TV even more remarkable is its affordability. Considering the high quality of both the picture and sound, the price was surprisingly low, making it a fantastic value for money.",POSITIVE
The tv was large compared to the previous 29 inch tv I had earlier But picture quality is excellent. Will be a pleasure to watch content on it Installation was same day. The service provider Siddhivinayak enterprises panjim goa sent a person who was very helpful and efficient. He guided through all the steps and installation was done. Will update after some days of use Sound is very disappointing . Sony could have provided better quality speakers at that price point,NEGATIVE
Good product.. Exllent picture quality and sound.... satisfied with this.Thanq sony and Amazon,POSITIVE
"Without getting into technical details, if you are looking for a TV that offers true colour 4K picture quality with a tv speaker that packs a punch, go for this product. Hands down, you will know the difference. Compared to models from other brands, this is costlier but well, “It’s a SONY” and you will not be disappointed for sure. Pros: 1. Seamless device connectivity - was able to connect my Firestick as well as cam and BT speakers in a flash. No fuss 2. Picture - Remember, SONY TVs show true colour which means you may feel brightness is lesser, but that’s cos it’s the actual picture quality itself. No problem in viewing angles and anti reflection is pretty effective 3. Sound- You can feel the bass in dialogues as well, what else to say. It’s punchy and surround connectivity and setup with non-Sony devices( mine are Panasonic, Bose and Marshall) is seamless 4. App connectivity- being an android TV, what you see on any google interface is what you see here. So, options are unlimited and it has enough space to install whatever apps you want 5. As Geeky as needed for Geeks- Yes, it packs all the jazz - Dolby Vision, Upscaling, morionflow, Dolby surround et al. For those of you who like tinkering and being specific, go on and you won’t be let down.  Thanks a ton Amazon for the lightening quick everything - TV delivered in 1 day and installation completed same day by Brand within 3 hours of delivery. Couldn’t have asked for a better delivery and Service experience.",POSITIVE
Really good project and nice service from sony,POSITIVE
"What a great picture clarity as always expected from a brand like Sony . Incredible details , sharpness, realistic pictures, sound quality. The installation was great as well !",POSITIVE
"Tv picture quality was very good in 55 inchs. Remote quality was also very good. But installation was bad he use very low quality bracket due to which tv was tilted towards front. Value for money, sound of tv was awesome. Must buy",POSITIVE
Tv is very good. Installed with electrician. Amazon installation persons never came. Buy from flipkart,POSITIVE
Good clarity and nice sound. but installation team is not professional,NEGATIVE
"Never brought this TV from Amazon. The amazon courier service was very bad. 1st time they delay the service to deliver the TV due to late delivery I cancelled the order. I order it again for 2nd time. Then 2nd issue was they didn't give the installation service. My experience for order this TV through Amazon was bad.  But TCL TV was very good 👍. The picture, sound and features are awesome. It comes with Dolby Atmos, Dolby vision, Onkoy 2.1 sound subwoofer, HDR 10. The Google applications are performing very smoothly. I recommend to all TV lover please brought this TV to experience a great picture, sound and other features of TV.",POSITIVE
Best tv in price and size,POSITIVE
"I got faulty TV, IR receiver inside TV didn’t responded. I need to raise warranty service request but they responded with worst solutions, later they assigned technicians to fix it. Technician contacted me by saying that I need to pay him 450INR to come to my home and fix it. I asked him, why i need to pay when its under warranty, but he denied saying that TV company will give them only 150INR to do the job, which will not cover my petrol costs also. Then he warned me saying that if i am interested for that price he will come to do service else leave. I contacted customer care and reported the issue with Technician, they said he should not take any money, and from their side they also escalated the issue. No reply from anyone, so i contacted technician again and said will see after the job done about money, first visit. He came and tried to do something with remote but no use. So he left that day saying he will be back again. After 2 days he came and opened TV , there we can see clearly that IR receiver cable is not connected to board. Its simply a assembly issue in manufacturing. He just clipped it, it worked. He asked for 750rs , then i asked it its under warranty right why i need to pay but he denied. Then he argued a lot and took money. Such a Worst customer care by TCL.  One more thing is that Amazon misleading or miscommunication about the product, by displaying it as OLED Tv . I thought its OLED and purchased but its not Oled tv. I got cheated by amazon",NEGATIVE
"not a qled, no mention of qled in box. pixel density is bad looks pixeleted even in 4k from close , delivery was late, charged me another 1000 rupees, which is a scam it offers a 200rs mounting kit. If you ask them to reschedule they asked me to install on my own. They will just claim the warranty and leave. Other this works fine with the tv perticularly game mode makes a good smoothing.",NEGATIVE

"Massive upgrade in picture and sound quality, silky smooth UI, superfast A15 bionic chip all these makes it a super cool powerhouse! Overall worth every penny🙌🏻",POSITIVE
"The speed, functionality, picture quality, connectivity everything works perfectly amazing purchase. This is a future proof product. Amazing work Apple.",POSITIVE
"Awesome product as usual from Apple. I also think this is the most value for money product apple has ever sold! Many people think that it’s useful only for non smart TVs. However that’s not true! Even for smart TVs, this is useful as the UI is waaay faster than any TV UI out there, even 2L+ Samsung TVs. So the experience is so much better! Plus of course the seamless compatibility in case you are in the apple ecosystem.",POSITIVE
Brilliant quality trusted,POSITIVE
"I bought this because I was very much frustrated with the speed and performance of the Android OS 11 in my Sony Bravia. This does the job for me really efficiently. It’s flawless with no lag or hanging just like other apple products. Cost wise it’s a bit on higher side but if that’s not an issue for you, it really improves overall TV viewing experience.",POSITIVE
"It's lifted my viewing experience several notches up especially the HDR vision, by the way I'm using Sony 4K television. The spatial audio is much noticeable especially on Apple TV OTT,",POSITIVE
"Simple and super fast, I am loving it 💘 No smart TV can match the experience. Siri voice Search is amazing and accurate..on the top of it I can see my photos from apple storage.",POSITIVE
"Pros: The navigation speeds is buttery smooth, handles anything like a pro. Feature rich stick with 4k hdr, dolby vision and atmos if you have capable hardware. It takes and gives the best of your tv. Amazing integration within the apple ecosystem like the homekit controls and facetimw feature. Remote is also perfect with find my feature if lost. Cons: Little bit pricey but hey it’s apple so what else would you expect. But you wouldn’t regret getting it anyways.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Sony Bravia 43-inch 4K Ultra HD TV, and I must say it has exceeded all my expectations! The picture quality is stunning with 4K resolution and the X1 4K Processor. Watching content on it feels like an immersive experience, especially with features like 4K HDR and Motion Flow XR100 that make every scene come to life.  The wide viewing angle ensures that everyone in the room gets a perfect view, and the sound quality, powered by Dolby Audio and Open Baffle speakers, adds richness to the audio, making it feel like you're at a movie theater. The Clear Phase feature enhances the audio further, providing crystal-clear sound.  The smart TV features are incredibly user-friendly. Google TV, voice search, and built-in Chromecast make it easy to stream my favorite shows from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and more. It also supports Apple AirPlay and Alexa, which add convenience to the setup. The one-year warranty provided by Sony is an added bonus, ensuring peace of mind with my purchase.  Overall, I am beyond satisfied with this TV. It offers incredible value for money with a sleek design, top-notch picture and sound quality, and an amazing smart TV experience. Highly recommend it!",POSITIVE
"The Sony Bravia 43-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED Google TV (KD-43X64L) delivers stunning picture quality with vibrant colors and sharp details. The user-friendly Google TV interface offers seamless access to apps and streaming services. Sound quality is clear and immersive, enhancing the viewing experience. Build quality feels premium, and the setup was quick and hassle-free. Overall, it's an excellent choice for a feature-packed smart TV.",POSITIVE
"After a using the 65 inch model for a month, 'll divide the review into pros and cons.  Pros: - The TV IS large. You'll find the difference between the other sizes and this one while watching YouTube or movies/TV shows. It feels like a mini theatre.  - The sound is crisp and clear and the same time loud enough! So poud at just 60% volume. I never had to take it more than 60 and the average sound volume I use is around 45-50 which is enough!  - The quality of 4K is so crisp, even for 1080p Full HD videos. I compared it's quality with chinese brands like Mi, etc. and the difference in clarity is clearly visible.  - it's 4K processor is a notch above! It automatically enhances 1080p and 720p videos. The 720p videos are just good enough, but the 1080p videos are greatly enhanced. - You can connect this TV with you Alexa device and then configure it to perform functions just by giving it voice commands. - You can use the Google TV smartphone app to control the TV with your phone, using it as a remote from any room.  Cons: - Haven't found anything yet!  All in all, it was a good purchase. So if you're looking for a 65 inch great quality 4K TV within ₹1 lac, I'd recommend going for it.",POSITIVE

"**Functionality: 9/10** This Sony bravia X74L is packed with a wide array of smart features. It supports all major streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and more, making it a one-stop shop for all entertainment needs. Additionally, the TV is compatible with both Alexa and Google Assistant, so voice commands can be used to control it. The ability to use multiple input options (HDMI 2.1, USB, Ethernet, etc.) makes it highly functional for different use cases.  **Performance: 10/10** In terms of picture quality, this LED TV is outstanding. The deep blacks, high contrast, and vibrant colors create a stunning viewing experience. Motion handling is excellent, with minimal blurring in fast-moving scenes, making it perfect for sports or action movies. HDR10+ features optimize picture quality scene-by-scene, making content look more lifelike and immersive. Sound performance is also good for a TV, due to lack of Dolby Atmos; you may want an external sound system for a true home theater experience.  **Value for Money: 8/10** This TV is certainly not cheap, but for LED picture quality and top-tier smart features, it’s worth the investment. If you're a movie enthusiast, gamer, or someone who values top-notch display quality, this TV provides solid value for the money.  **Ease of Use: 8.5/10** Setting up the TV is simple, interface being user-friendly and intuitive. The Magic Remote, which acts as both a traditional and a pointer-based controller, makes navigation easy and convenient. Voice control integration through Alexa or Google Assistant further enhances ease of use.  **Lag: 9/10** For regular viewing, the TV has negligible input lag, making it perfect for sports, live TV, and movies. For gamers, input lag in Game Mode is remarkably low (around 12 ms), especially when connected via HDMI 2.1. This makes it one of the best TVs for console and PC gaming. There is no noticeable lag when using apps or navigating menus, ensuring a smooth and fluid user experience.  **Overall Rating: 9/10** The Sony Bravia stands out for its exceptional performance, particularly in picture quality, speed, and functionality. While it might not be the cheapest option, it delivers excellent value for those looking for a premium viewing experience, especially if you enjoy gaming or watching high-definition content. If ease of use and low lag are priorities, this TV won’t disappoint.",POSITIVE
The product is really Good. The installation was done immediately the next day and a neat demo was given. The product quality is good and nice and it is strongly recommended to anyone who is interested to buy a quality and cost-effective smart tv. The Tv has various features. Thank you Acer for the product quality.,POSITIVE
"1. Picture quality and clarity are superb. 8/10 2. Sound quality is also amazing. 9/10 3. Supported apps and UI (OS Google) are also smooth, but sometimes it tends to get laggy. 6/10 4. Connectivity is an issue; whenever I try to pair it with my Bluetooth device, it fails. 2/10 Overall, at such a price, it's a value for money.",NEGATIVE
This tv is a good and well performed.but some times it may be stucked and doesnot respond.but overall performance is good and clarity wise and sound quality it's nice tv.worth for money,POSITIVE
"The screen is bright and does its job quite well while displaying 4k content. Speakers are of only 36wh but the output is way better for an apartment type home. Its value for money definitely acer is doing amazing in budget TV section. The processor is one con that I discovered that it can get laggy, it forcefully gets out of apps to maintain the performance but you can sometimes feel the laggyness. I'd hope acer will use better processors for next lineup of TVs. Except the processor, everything is good and the product is recommendable.",POSITIVE
"The Acer 40-inch Smart Full HD TV is an impressive addition to any home entertainment setup. With its sleek design and vibrant display, it truly elevates the viewing experience.

The user interface is intuitive, allowing for easy navigation and quick access to your favorite apps.

Overall, the Acer 40-inch Smart Full HD TV combines quality performance with user-friendly features, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment experience. Highly recommended for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike!",POSITIVE
"Putting this review after almost a month of usage. Picture quality and streaming quality is good. Display colour and sound also great. But lagging in performance, bluetooth remote sometimes not working, and only works through IR mode. Surfing between apps is still a bad experience. Viewing files in the pendrive is so much difficult. Even a 720p video can't be played smoothly when it's on my pendrive, but streaming a 1080p video through ott apps still works smoother. User interface is good, adjusting screen brightness, making some changes in the settings during an app usage is better than MI TVs. On an average It's good for the pricing, but it's not promising the specifications mentioned by the company, Acer should improve these things in the upcoming updates.",NEGATIVE
The acer I pro 43 inch 4k tv has very nice picture quality. There is minor lag in settings. Other then that UI is very smooth. My only problem is with the video playback from external hard disk. The inbuilt media player keep crashing while play 4k movies. some time takes too much time to load videos from hard disk and also sometimes it got stuck while fast forwarding. The issue doesn't solve with other media player. Nova player works fine in this tv but doesn't support HDR . The MX plays can play HDR videos but keeps freezing in this. (Both player works fine with my mi box 4k). I purchased this tv hoping the newer processor in this model will be more powerful but that's not the case. Or it may be it is some optimization problem. Otherwise tha picture quality is very good while playing online videos.,NEGATIVE
"Today, I received my Acer I Pro 55-inch TV, and after watching it, I want to share my review with all of you. This review will focus on my experience with the VA panel TV.  After watching multiple reviews on YouTube, I bought this TV, but I am very disappointed with those YouTubers. While they highlighted many positive aspects of the TV, they did not properly explain the limitations of the VA panel.  Here’s the issue: VA panels lose color accuracy when viewed from angles beyond 20 degrees. These panels are excellent if you’re viewing the TV directly from the front, where they provide 100% color accuracy. However, as soon as you change your viewing angle, you will notice significant color distortion. The picture begins to fade, and if your seating position changes to 30 to 40 degrees, the colors look completely washed out, and the picture loses its vibrancy.  Based on my experience, I strongly suggest that before purchasing a large-screen TV, visit a store and compare VA panels TV with IPS panels TV, especially on SD channels, which many of us watch daily. This will help you make a more informed decision.",NEGATIVE
Mi tv is good and nice quality. I have been using 43 inch mi 4k tv since 2021 and now again buy another mi tv. Value for money. Display quality is nice.,POSITIVE
"I'm using this tv in last 2 months....there is no issues, good sound quality, good build quality, clear display, no lagging, always watching movies in prime and hot star without lagging....some peoples told in reviews like there is a big bassils not like the tv picture from the app......it's depends on your video aspect ratio no tv fault My opinion is worth for money",NEGATIVE
"LG, Samsung, and Sony were, for 6-7 years, the only brands to dominate the television market.  In today’s era, what I feel is that brands of television that come under 20k–22k (I am talking about a 40- or 43-inch TV), brands like Xiaomi-Redmi-MI, TCL, Thomson, Oneplus, Haier, Iffalcon, etc., or any other Chinese or French-assembled brands in India have all the same panels.  The price we pay while choosing from one of these brands is for the brand name alone, or what’s the current position the brand is holding in the market. For example, Xiamoi and Oneplus hold good brand value, so their televisions' prices lie between 18 and 22k for a 40 or 43inch.  On the other hand, brands like TCL and Thomson are working hard on establishing their brand to get ahead of Xiaomi and Oneplus. That’s why their products’ price for the same 40-42 inch is between 15000 and 21,000.  All I want to say is that if you want the best picture quality, Android/Google UI/UX experience, and speed in your TV, then I would definitely say to push your budget 4x upwards and obviously go for the oldest television dominators in the market (what we call the Sada Bahar product), i.e., Sony, LG, and Samsung. Which price will start at 27k and go up to 40k.  Or  If your purpose is to watch DTH, HD channels only, want good picture quality, and a smooth Android/Google UI/UX experience does not matter to you that much, then you can definitely go for any brand that is selling TVs under 22K.  You can buy any of the brands, either Xiamoi or Thomson TV, because they use the same panels, the back body build quality is the same, there might be minute things here and there, but all over the experience and the quality are the same. They are all assembled; just the brand name is changed, and you are paying 2-3k more for that brand name only.  Now, you’ll say, ""After-sale service also matters, and it differs brand to brand.” Yes, I absolutely agree with you on that. But tell me one thing: in almost all these brands, you are getting a 1 or 2 year warranty. Right? So, if you purchase online, you get all the facilities, the toll-free number, the brand’s customer care details, etc., and if any problem occurs, then with such an established system, these brands are selling appliances across the globe, so these brands, if some problem occurs, will definitely respond and will the service you want, whether it’s Thomson or Xiaomi.  So, in after-sale service too, these brands are all the same. With the brands Sony, Samsung, and LG, it is all about reliability, credibility, supreme quality, and overall experience.   All in all, I am satisfied with my purchase; it is a good TV. But when it came, I was going through the details of the Thomson TV. The reviews were all good, and I felt that 19000 ka Xiaomi ki jaghe Thomson ka same 40-inch 15000 vala le leta. Because saab kuch from display to features same hi toh hai, sirf brand name ka farak hai. But anyways, jo kharidliya voh badhiya, aab kya sochna.  If you are planning to purchase a 40- to 43-inch TV below 20k–22k, then go with any of the brands, from TCL to Xiaomi to Oneplus to Thomson. Only if a brand name written on the TV’s bottom does not matter to you; just the TV matters!!!  Peace!!!",NEGATIVE
"TV stopped working within 1 month after purchase. after raising the complaint(TVIN2404210000143) on 21/4/24 technician visited my place and told me that the problem was with the cable provider and closed the complaint. but when I checked with cable providers I came to know that the problem was With the TV itself.  As already complaint has already closed I had to raise a new complaint (TVIN2404270002095) on 27/4/24. this time the technician visited my place and told me that there was a problem with the motherboard and to replace that board I had to wait for another week. but the problem was not solved. TV was not working Even after installing the New motherboard. this time the technician told me There was a problem with the display panel and it had to be replaced. and he will inform service providers regarding this.  After this, I waited for a few days but I didn't get any update from the service providers. so I called customer care and I got to know that my complaint had been closed without any resolution. and they didn't contact me regarding this.  After this, I raised the complaint (TVIN 2405110000356) on 11/5/24 for the replacement of the display panel as suggested by the technician. he visited my place with the new display panel on 22/5/24. and while installing that display I could see sparks and smoke all over the TV. And he couldn't able to install it as the entire TV was defective. and he informed us that the TV isn't in reparable condition and it will be replaced.  But on 23/5/24 I checked in the Xiaomi app about the status of the complaint and I could see in the Xiaomi app that the complaint had been closed without any resolution. and on the same day, I got a call from one more technician saying that he would take the defective TV back.. and he will check whether it was repairable or not. and he is saying it will not be replaced. And on 25/5/24 your technician took the TV from home and asked us to wait again for 7 working days.  After waiting for 1 week, a service centre person came with a TV on 1/6/24. Still, the TV was not working properly. I could see a complete reddish and blurry display. The technician said the service centre person would come on 3/6/24 and they would do the repair and he left. But as usual, no one appeared on 3/6/24. So I called the service centre and they are ready with an answer that they sent some mail to the product head regarding this and I have to wait for another 48 hrs. And the waiting game continues...  After going through all this drama and talking to the Xiaomi customer care and service centre, am certain that it's my fault that I bought Xiaomi's product.  And I already waited for 1 month and 16 days (46days) for it to be repaired. but it didn't happen. I hardly used it for 1 month. They took 46 days to repair it and still, they couldn't do it. The customer service executives ask you to call the service centre as they don't have proper details about the complaint. If you call the service centre they will speak as if they are doing any favour to you.  This is how Xiaomi provides after-sales service. Please think twice before you buy Xiaomi products. They provide very pathetic after-sale service.",NEGATIVE
"This TV offers excellent picture quality with vibrant colors and sharp 4K resolution. Sound is also clear .The smart features are intuitive, with a responsive interface but a limited app store due to the OS. Its sleek design and ample connectivity options are also strong points. it's a solid choice for those seeking a high-quality TV at a reasonable price. Would recommend, especially for casual viewers.",POSITIVE
I have been using this tv since last 3 months and its the best tv anyone can consider at this price range with best 4k gaming features and quality output. It provides great colour and audio quality is also perfect over all sound effects - consist with good function and all expected and used ports - vidaa os is very smooth and with updates i think will provide better options - brightness over 70% feels very adequate and perfect  overall can be considered as the best 4k gaming tv with good refresh rate in budget range of 50-60k,POSITIVE
"Only thing that this tv lacked was the OS(not google/android). But after 3 months I think hisense own OS ""Vida"" is way faster,snappy. Casting your laptop or android phone has no lag. Also has airplay.  Specs are near perfect [in Q3/2024]. Speakers 40wt is good enough. I rarely turn on my home theater unless I neeed that Booom in my living room. Sound is enough to fill a big indian living room.  Only negative: google has more apps. Vida is adding apps but they need pick up some pace. They have all the basic apps you would need. You can run any video audio format via usb. No need to install video players. In jan 2025 these apps as available: Netflix,youtube, disneyplus, prime, sony, zee5, apply, crunchy roll, jio cinema, yupptv.  Most of the other are not for India region. No VPN app that I could find.  Conclusion: worth your money, perfect specs, needs more india based apps, no issues with PS5 or Ps4.",POSITIVE
"This is my second Hisense TV purchase, and I am very pleased once again. The picture quality is excellent. The sound quality is impressive considering the slim build of the TV; the subwoofer is decent, providing enough bass, though it doesn’t quite match the depth of a dedicated subwoofer. So you'll have to go for external speakers if you want that extra thump.  This TV has a lot of features, many of which I haven't tested yet. The Vidaa OS operates smoothly, but the downside with it not being an android/Google TV is the limited availability of apps. I'm a Spotify subscriber and I often listen to music on my old Hisense android tv which seamlessly connects with spotify, but this TV doesn't, which is disappointing. And if you have a Hotstar Premium subscription, you won’t be able to watch content in 4K on this TV for some reason, it only goes upto 1080p. However, I have paired this TV with a Jio STB, so I don't rely on the built-in apps much.  Overall, it’s a very good TV if you primarily want to enjoy your TV channels and some OTT apps.  I'd give it a solid 4.5/5 ⭐",POSITIVE
"I owned a Hisense Television which I was really happy with, and that encouraged me to choose Hisense while I was looking for a bigger size. And with all honesty, I can say that this one's even better. Picture, Sound, Built, even the viewing angles are excellent. Perfect TV at justifyable price",POSITIVE
"The Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers an excellent combination of performance, features, and value. With a large 65-inch screen, it delivers crisp 4K resolution, vibrant colors, and decent contrast. The picture quality is solid for the price, making it a great choice for those who want an affordable yet high-performing TV for watching movies, TV shows, or gaming.  The smart features are intuitive and easy to use, thanks to its Android TV platform, which provides access to a wide variety of streaming services, apps, and built-in voice control with Google Assistant. The TV supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, offering an enhanced viewing experience with deeper blacks and brighter highlights.  In terms of design, the Hisense 65-inch TV has a sleek and modern look, with slim bezels that allow for a more immersive viewing experience. The sound quality is decent, but for an enhanced audio experience, pairing it with an external soundbar or home theater system might be a good idea.  Connectivity options are solid, with multiple HDMI ports, USB inputs, and Wi-Fi support, making it easy to hook up your devices.  Overall, the Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers impressive value for its price, delivering great picture quality, user-friendly smart features, and a modern design. It’s a solid option for anyone looking for a large, budget-friendly smart TV.",POSITIVE
Im super impressed by this tv. Amazing quality crisp sound and video. Lets hope it has longetivity! For now definetly worth every rupee,POSITIVE
"Bought this Q7N Tornado in August 2024. Review after 4 months :- Problem : bright colors causes eye strain. I even tried cinema mode, film maker mode, energy saving mode, standard mode of video but the eyes pain / eyes feel tired after watching the TV from 10-12 feet distance for 1 to 2 hours.  Benefits: Very good picture quality and clarity. 4k is very nice but too bright. Sound quality is very good nothing negative there. Connectivity options are good hdmi, usb, Bluetooth WiFi all connect very well. Vida OS is awesome no lag so far and I need only few apps like Netflix, prime, YouTube, hotstar ,zee5, sonyliv. All these apps are sufficient.  Since the screen is smooth, if you have tubelight or light or window directly opposite face to the TV then you see the reflection/glare of that tubelight or window sun light. Need to make the room darker by curtains or off the tubelight to remove its glare. I wish the screen was with matt anti-glare finishing.  Atleast I hope the company puts out some video settings recommendations to reduce eye strain for watching this TV. My old Samsung LCD 32 inch screen was better and caused no eye strain.",POSITIVE
good quality for a good price,POSITIVE
"Multiple options of audio/video input/output. I can connect my Bluetooth headphones to it. Picture quality is great. Can control with phone via App. Some was saying that it is a bit slow to respond, I don't feel so. View angles are great, colour stays same at any direction. It's worth it money. Using it for 5 months so far.",POSITIVE
"BEST VALUE FOR MONEY, KEPT SEARCHING FOR 6 MONTHS, AND WHEN I PURCHASED IT, I WAS SO SCARED TO REGRET IT!  AND NOW AFTER COUPLE OF MONTHS I CAN CONFIRM I DID NOT REGRET IT! I USE IT ONLY TO WATCH CARTOON FOR KIDS AND ME STREAMING. I HAVE A CHROME CAST, BUT NO LONGER USING IT THE SOFTWARE IS STABLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME USE IT DIRECTLY AND NO CHROME CAST LIKE MY OLD TV  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,",NEGATIVE
"It's worth the price, i realy like this TV E7k 55""!!!picture quality,the tv speaker,for gaming ps5 with 60hz native.hiw fast to navigate on the homescreen.like they say, i recommend this TV with good features that will not break the bank.. But if you have budget for qled like this with 144hz go for it. But for me, from my 7 y/o LG 59"" its a great upgrade and i am satisfied with this TV.",POSITIVE
good in evry thing except it is vivid system not open app sestem program no way to add any app out of vivid stor,NEGATIVE
"Tv picture quality was very good in 55 inchs. Remote quality was also very good. But installation was bad he use very low quality bracket due to which tv was tilted towards front. Value for money, sound of tv was awesome. Must buy",POSITIVE
Tv is very good. Installed with electrician. Amazon installation persons never came. Buy from flipkart,POSITIVE
Good clarity and nice sound. but installation team is not professional,NEGATIVE
"Never brought this TV from Amazon. The amazon courier service was very bad. 1st time they delay the service to deliver the TV due to late delivery I cancelled the order. I order it again for 2nd time. Then 2nd issue was they didn't give the installation service. My experience for order this TV through Amazon was bad.  But TCL TV was very good 👍. The picture, sound and features are awesome. It comes with Dolby Atmos, Dolby vision, Onkoy 2.1 sound subwoofer, HDR 10. The Google applications are performing very smoothly. I recommend to all TV lover please brought this TV to experience a great picture, sound and other features of TV.",POSITIVE
Best tv in price and size,POSITIVE
"I got faulty TV, IR receiver inside TV didn’t responded. I need to raise warranty service request but they responded with worst solutions, later they assigned technicians to fix it. Technician contacted me by saying that I need to pay him 450INR to come to my home and fix it. I asked him, why i need to pay when its under warranty, but he denied saying that TV company will give them only 150INR to do the job, which will not cover my petrol costs also. Then he warned me saying that if i am interested for that price he will come to do service else leave. I contacted customer care and reported the issue with Technician, they said he should not take any money, and from their side they also escalated the issue. No reply from anyone, so i contacted technician again and said will see after the job done about money, first visit. He came and tried to do something with remote but no use. So he left that day saying he will be back again. After 2 days he came and opened TV , there we can see clearly that IR receiver cable is not connected to board. Its simply a assembly issue in manufacturing. He just clipped it, it worked. He asked for 750rs , then i asked it its under warranty right why i need to pay but he denied. Then he argued a lot and took money. Such a Worst customer care by TCL.  One more thing is that Amazon misleading or miscommunication about the product, by displaying it as OLED Tv . I thought its OLED and purchased but its not Oled tv. I got cheated by amazon",NEGATIVE
"not a qled, no mention of qled in box. pixel density is bad looks pixeleted even in 4k from close , delivery was late, charged me another 1000 rupees, which is a scam it offers a 200rs mounting kit. If you ask them to reschedule they asked me to install on my own. They will just claim the warranty and leave. Other this works fine with the tv perticularly game mode makes a good smoothing.",NEGATIVE
Excellent,POSITIVE
"Value For Money, Picture Clarity & Sound Quality Is Really Really Awesome Really I Liked This Product Quality Of Product is No.1 Installation Is Also Very Simple Size & Design Altimate.",POSITIVE
"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering.

Worth for the money,POSITIVE
Best sound and best display Thanks,POSITIVE
This is amongst the Best product ever,POSITIVE
"* Amazon delivered early morning * Installation done on the same day, knowledgeable service person * Review based on 2 months usage  Why I chose Panasonic? Nothing special, I still have my 13yr old 32 inch Panasonic TV running fine. So I wanted to buy same brand once again :D  PROs * Nice picture and sound quality. I upgraded from a older Panasonic 720p TV, so * OS is faster most of the times. I don't see much of a difference compared to the basic firestick. * Nice smart Remote with minimal keys * The wall mount coming with the TV is enough this TV. But it is recommended to buy a generic mount if there are any plans to upgrade in near future. * Connecting to WIFI and Bluetooth devices works fine.  CONs * OS lags some times when multiple apps are opened. So this is purely based on usage. * TV audio is ok but recommend to have a soundbar or something  Haven't tested ethernet connectivity, will update once done  Note : Recommended to get an external stabilizer",NEGATIVE
"The speed of processor is very slow. The remote goes stuck every few seconds..cant watch TV peacefully... It's like being using old age phone in this era.... The memory of the TV was written 16 gb in description but the memory is only 8gb total... It's showing 7.8 gb total... Available after apps of TV (in built) is 4.8 GB... I was expecting atleast that you don't lie AMAZON. Overall, I'm not happy what I got... Only good part is screen... It's good",NEGATIVE
Picture quality is excellent. As a basic TV it's easy to use. Overall a great TV.,POSITIVE
"I owned many TVs. But this VW has shocked me with its picture quality and dynamic contrast. It has some technology its written on box, that technology boosts colors variation and dynamic contrasts. 1080p will feel like 4k at 2160p. I got it at 12k. I thought it will average TV i bought it for my work location flat. But it surprised me. Superb picture quality beating my other LG, Samsung TVs. It lacks at drawing Hz, can drop as low as 24FPS to boost colors. If you want better Hertz processing then prefer 55Inch TCL. This TV compromises Hertz but exceptional in picture quality, colors boost, dynamic contrasts... Buy this good Indian value for price product, its Manufactured in Noida city of UP. Making it complete Indian product.",POSITIVE
"I purchased VW43QUW1 QLED TV on 6th May 2024.  ONLY CONS:  1. Customer Care is a BIG ZERO. The company's tag line is ""Made in India, for India"". They should add ""We give Indian Post Sale Service"" - which means Customer can go to hell.  2. It's Magic Remote does NOT work as Universal Remote as claimed in the specifications of the TV on Manufacturer's and Amazon website, and even mentioned on the Box and the User Guide.  3. TV Bluetooth does NOT recognize Android Smartphone Bluetooth.  4. Specifications claim 8GB inbuilt memory. But TV shows 1.9GB.  5. TV is NOT Frameless as claimed in the Specifications mentioned on Manufacturer's and Amazon websites. It has a Bezel of 15mm at the bottom and 10mm on the other three sides.  6. HDR10+ feature claimed in specifications on Manufacturer's and Amazon website, and even on the first picture on both websites is NOT there in the TV and NOT even mentioned on the Box.  7. Customer Care email id NOT updated on Company website, because they DON’T want you to reach out to them.  8. Customer Care availability on phone NOT mentioned on Company's website nor any recorded message when you call outside their working hours.  Being a Senior Citizen and an Indian to the core, I thought of promoting ATMANIRBHAR BHARAT, so I ventured out to purchase this ""Made in India, for India"" TV. But I feel let down and cheated.  I approached their Customer Care three times on phone, once on WhatsApp and once on Email, in last three consecutive days. But they will NOT register my complaint. They will promise to revert, but DON'T revert. So now I am left high and dry and don't know what to do.  Only option is replacement, NO RETURN, but what is the GUARANTEE that the replaced unit will be any better or worse?  My issues appear to be very trivial and don't need rocket science to resolve. I don't understand why the Manufacturer is running away from their responsibility, and not coming forward to resolve the issues and earn kudos and 5* from me.  WARNING: Friends, please purchase this product solely at your own RISK. Manufacturer is NOT RESPONSIBLE for the QUALITY of the product, and DON'T expect any AFTER SALES SERVICE.  P.S. Can any of the buyers of this model on the platform help me atleast with my issues at s.nos. 2 & 3. Thanks in advance.",NEGATIVE
"The TV is good, very good picture, quality and sound output since using it from last six month, but now sometimes I am facing issues in sound connectivity. May go for purchase.",NEGATIVE
"Here's a sample TV review ba  I purchased this TV two months ago, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed! Given the price point, I was a bit skeptical at first, but this TV has exceeded my expectations in every way.  The picture quality is superb, with vibrant colors and crystal-clear clarity. The sound system is also top-notch, providing an immersive viewing experience. I've had no issues with connectivity, and the smart features are seamless and easy to use.  The build quality is solid, and the design is sleek and modern. I've received numerous compliments from friends and family who've seen it.  What really stands out, however, is the value for money. I've compared it to other TVs in the same price range, and this one outshines them all. It's a steal!  If you're in the market for a new TV and want a great deal, look no further. I highly recommend this TV. Two months in, and I can confidently say it's worth every penny.  Pros:  - Excellent picture quality - Great sound system - Easy connectivity and smart features - Solid build quality and sleek design - Unbeatable value for money",POSITIVE
This product is really good...sound quality amezing..and display quality is also Good,POSITIVE
"I replaced my xiamoi TV with Vw. I thought 43 inch coming so cheap will have some drawbacks Compared to Xiamoi this is a let down, interface is ok, there is lag will scrolling. Need to work more on the remote. Tv audio is not that great.INSTALLTION WAS BIG PAIN .... AS I HAD TO WAIT FOR 4 DAYS......I went ahead got it installed with my local guy. Please note Amazon had informed me that they will arrange a person to install but after 2 days this was after me calling the 2nd day of delivery.to be fair they called me on 4thday but I had gone ahead and install the TV AS I started getting stinker from my family. Overall feedback from me it's good for a second TV MAY be some wants to install it in bedroom a but not recommendd for a living room",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the VW 80cm LED TV, and I'm genuinely impressed with its performance. The picture quality is vibrant and sharp, making everything from movies to sports visually engaging. The color accuracy is notable, with deep blacks and bright whites that enhance the viewing experience.  Setting up the TV was straightforward, and the interface is user-friendly, making navigation a breeze. The built-in speakers deliver decent sound quality, it's showing very good quality with fire TV stick also responce is decent and good.  One of the standout features is its energy efficiency, which is a plus for anyone looking to save on power bills. Overall, the VW 80cm LED TV offers great value for its price, making it an excellent choice for those seeking a reliable and quality viewing experience.",POSITIVE
"Aug 4 2024( week of usage) -This is freaking beautiful 😍! -People are going for brighter pannels in LG's, they must really be having staring contest with Sun, because this is BRIGHT AF. Provided I keep the room pitch dark, for the Iris to open up to notice the blacks and the brightness is more than enough (I keep it around 52% to 68% bright and even then the whole room lits up). - Amazing Inbuilt Speakers. -Software is well made, smooth and amazing!!! Please note that, even the high end TV's have a very mediocre performing CPU/APU and this might be inferior but In my experience It is butter smooth (Haven't tested out all the applications, just the UI and Stuff) -Have dedicated gaming mode and ALLM and Input lag seems to be veryyy less in my experience, as I haven't seen any exact number yet, but Gaming on this is a bliss in my experience.  -Since this is an OLED from 2022. I am literally babysitting the pannel and not keeping things static, to avoid OLED burn in. I will keep this review updated.  This TV might just change the whole stigma I had for Xiaomi, if this lasts and stands the test of time.  Dec 26 2024  Still one of the best TV experiences for me",POSITIVE
"Cheapest OLED TV. Sill it OLED, so the picture will be better than Mini Led TVs Android TV OS, feels good to use and ParchWall is also nice Sound is decent, not punchy but decent for the 30W speakers. Dolby Vision IQ and Dolby Vision Dark - Great for watching movies and TV shows Peek Brightness is good, even in a well lit room. Drawbacks: *Bad Viewing angle - Pink tint appears when you watch from the sides *Screen Flickers when External HDD is connected. Must be the power issue but works fine with Pendrive *Got a few dead pixels within a couple of weeks but they are gone after doing pixel refresh from the settings *No OS or Security Updates. *Having trouble playing Dolby Vision and Atmos together on Disney+Hotstar. But it's fine if you have a Sound bar with passthrough enabled *Default video player won't play Dolby Vision from the pendrive. Have to download a separate player for that. *Only one year warranty *Mi didn't manufactur any new OLED TVs,so the tv manufactured year is 2022 If you are OK with all the above, it's worth buying",POSITIVE
"Got this beauty in December 2023. Truly amazing OlEd screen which makes the room light up especially in the dark. Everyone that comes and watches a movie, just stares into it. Trully immersive. I recommend getting a movable wall mount to watch perfection from any angle of room. Value for money",POSITIVE
The tv is very excellent in picture quality and sound but lacks software that the tv doesn't function well in at least turning on and off that if you watch the tv and turn it off after some time you turn on the tv it won't turn on because the wifi and Bluetooth doesn't turn on it will be turned off this the remote they provide is working with Bluetooth so it won't work and i have to manually restart the tv to get to working very bad experience got the tv replace 2 time and now I am returning it very bad they are making the tv missing the biggest feature of turning on and off*******note***** if you are okay with shutting down the tv and turning on the tv like a Android smartphone we shutdown is okay you can go for it because on the other side it is pretty good is fast and pictures colour super cool but if there are old people in your house and want to watch tv channel like newss and all this tv is not good not old friendly tv only new gen,NEGATIVE
Working well and fine,POSITIVE
The TV looks clean. A go to choice for people who’re looking for an OLED panel at a lower price. Would highly recommend for leisure gaming or watching a movie if you wanna be budget friendly as well.,NEGATIVE
"Whatever has been said good abt the TV is true. This is an awesome TV. However, the only problem I faced was with Hotstar - which doesn't play Dolby and Netflix which doesn't support 4k fully. When I enquired from Netflix, they said that it is not compatible and hence, problems may remain. But the easiest solution is to buy a 4k Fire Stick where you get every apps displaying in 4k. The voice function is alos very good and is very handy when your remote is lost :). The quality of picture is awesome. The best part is the voice which is like a theatre system. I don't think we wod need an external sound source with this. The UI is also very nice, specially the default MI Patchwall. I think getting OLED at 50K is just an awesome deal even with saome flaws. Just remember to take an extended warranty bcz you may never know.",POSITIVE
Worth for the quality and price,POSITIVE
"Superb quality and excellent features  My Samsung Frame TV (Matt Finish)  The first thing I like is to have our customizable Photos / Paintings as a Frame and It looks like a real.  The picture quality is far better than I expected and is fully customizable to suit your room, even though it can adjust itself automatically depending on the darkness of the room, time of day etc.  The sound quality through the TV is excellent but I opted to add the Samsung Sound Bar with sourrended speakers for some really immersive viewing.  The one thing that I really like is that there’s just 1 thin cable from the TV, which plugs into the hub.  Features again are superb and there are loads of options to set up your TV exactly as you want it.  Finally, value for money? Yes most definitely in my opinion. I have an excellent TV, with the features, quality, and price I wanted, which I think is definitely value for money for a quality product like this.",POSITIVE
Qlty good sound qlty good eassy we installed it happy to buy. Picture qlty good 4k qlty good. As per price vallue good,POSITIVE
"This 2024 4k qled may be slightly better than a regular 4k LED tv.  Picture quality is good. Colour reproduction is uniform and consistent. But audio is cheap, Dolby audio is good but you would need to connect a soundbar.  HDR performance is good. Not great due to average brightness of the panel, peaks around 450nits.  No VRR. Watching Sports is normal like a regular 50Hz TV. For smoother sports action might consider different TV with120Hz or higher refresh rate.  Screen is reflective, so need to take some measures for direct light glares. Design is slim and looks premium. Minimal bezel. Build quality is good.  Accessibility of the port will be a major issue if you are planning to wall mount. Purchase a movable telescopic wall mount, some extra cost for ease of access and cleaning. Installation was within 24 hours. Remote is the highlight. Tiny and handy.  Tizen OS is light but not so snappy. App store is not so great, but you get most of the popular OTT. Could not locate samsung game hub support in this.  Edit: Sometimes I noticed clouding in non-HDR dark scenes. It may be due to edgelit LED in this tv, which cannot produce local dimming as you could get in a backlit panel.",NEGATIVE
"This is a review almost after one year of using the product. Great picture quality. But after the software update in October, the software has become really buggy and a hassle to use the TV. Everytime I switch on the TV, the brightness becomes completely low. The universal remote is so buggy that everytime I switch on the TV, the set top box would switch off. Now I have turned off the universal remote feature and that’s not happening. But the technicians are not able to understand that. Have communicated multiple times that these two issues have come up after the software update but they don’t even listen to me. Tired of changing the brightness setting every single time I turn on the TV. Been waiting for a software update since October 2023 but that is also not happening. Wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy this product and go through this effort. Not worth it.",NEGATIVE
I have been using this tv for almost a year now and I can certainly say that it one of the best smart tvs available in the market. I was sceptical initially about the picture quality comparing the other tv available in the market. But after using it for this long I am very happy with the picture quality. Built in speakers a way better than the other tvs in this range. It gives proper thump and crisp sound. At last talking about the best feature which is being a frame tv it looks super cool and whenever someone is coming to your house they are definitely going to talk about the tv. It stands out from the rest.,POSITIVE
"I am writing this review after using for 3 days.  I have watched - Movie and IND vs AUS live match in OTT apps: Video and audio quality is too good. - Watched latest video songs on YouTube app: Video quality and audio quality is too good. - Watched SD channel in DTH: SD channel is handled perfectly. I don't see any blur nees and video quality loss. Don't see colors banding, Video sharpness is also perfectly handled. - Watched HD channels in DTH: No need say. Quality is too good. - Watched 4K content from YouTube: Quality is too good.  Pleasure watching my all time favorite movie THOLIPREMA (1998) in this TV. Amazed with video quality, image sharpness and audio quality considering old movie.  Design: - Almost Baseless TV - Thin TV. Just like a frame. - Simple remote. But all controls has it. - Can charge remote with Solar and USB type C.  Delivery and installation: - Received TV in 1 day. - Installation done on next day.  Features: - Connected to smart things app. - From app, we can control TV with virtual remote. - TV turn on/ off also controlled with app.  I thought of buying Samsung Frame 2022 55 inches TV. But in offer sales I didn't get better deal.  I am happy with Samsung QLED 2023 55 inch TV. I strongly recommend this TV.",POSITIVE
"Cons: 1)It's expensive. 2)You have to buy a frame/bezel separately(3k-9k) 3)One Connect Box has to be stored or hidden somewhere & buy accessories to attach other devices 4)Software, yes it laggs (do proper switch off/on & it will be fine)  Is it worth buying? YES, DEFINITELY. 1) ART, ART & ART 2) Matte screen: Anti-glare, low gloss finish that handles reflections well ( IN DAY LIGHT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN A REALLY ART) 3) Picture quality & Design 4) Practical remote(no cells required, you have to charge it)",NEGATIVE
"I purchased a Blaupunkt 40 inch TV, a week ago so I share a geniune review. Tv installation done within 24 hours of delivery of tv. I am impressed with its performance in this price range . The picture quality is excellent, with vibrant colors and sharp details that make watching movies and shows a great experience. The sound quality is very good, crisp and clear , bass is also good , no need of any sound bar. Tv has a feature of Google assistant and its work fine. Remote of tv is also classy and easy to use. The smart features of tv work smoothly, Ott apps like Netflix, YouTube, jio tv , prime video and other open without lag and work good without any hassle.  Overall, I am satisfied with this Blaupunkt TV and recommend it to buy anyone who is looking for a good budget-friendly tv.",POSITIVE
"As many of us may think it's a unknown brand, let me clear that those who r having car since 80s or 90s must have used its sound system for their car, so I was well aware of the name. Buying the Blaupunkt tv 55inch was proven a good deal and it has the perfect picture quality and a far better sound quality than other brands not only in this budget range but above price range too. The design, build quality, live colors, smooth and easy operation and of course affordable price makes it a perfect buy TV.",POSITIVE
"We have been using this TV for a appx month now, and it's been an excellent experience. The image quality is outstanding, with vibrant colors and sharp 4K clarity that makes everything look stunning. The Quantum Dot technology really enhances the visuals, especially for HDR content.  The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering rich and immersive audio without needing external speakers. The built-in features and smart interface are smooth and responsive, making navigation and streaming a breeze.  Overall, it's a great value for the price and has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a budget-friendly yet premium TV experience! We will update this review in six moth as we get more experience with its performance..",POSITIVE
"I am Giving my impression after using this TV for 5 months. This is a good Qled TV at this price point, with good picture quality and excellent sound.",POSITIVE
"Thanks Amazon and thnks Blupunkt, The picture quality and sound quality is to good. I am really very happy to purchase this tv. Thanks a lot.",POSITIVE
"Quality is good, Display quality is excellent, with vibrant colors and crisp images. Performance is excellent. Value for money.",POSITIVE
"Tv is working so good... screen , sound quality, everything is perfect. Good Deal at reasonable price.",POSITIVE
This is one of the best budget qled tv under 30k Picture quality is quite decent and good enough Sound quality is better and louder than other competitors. Working Seamlessly since last 6 months Con: Aux Audio output is Unavailable,POSITIVE
"This TV offers excellent picture quality with vibrant colors and sharp 4K resolution. Sound is also clear .The smart features are intuitive, with a responsive interface but a limited app store due to the OS. Its sleek design and ample connectivity options are also strong points. it's a solid choice for those seeking a high-quality TV at a reasonable price. Would recommend, especially for casual viewers.",POSITIVE
I have been using this tv since last 3 months and its the best tv anyone can consider at this price range with best 4k gaming features and quality output. It provides great colour and audio quality is also perfect over all sound effects - consist with good function and all expected and used ports - vidaa os is very smooth and with updates i think will provide better options - brightness over 70% feels very adequate and perfect  overall can be considered as the best 4k gaming tv with good refresh rate in budget range of 50-60k,POSITIVE
"Only thing that this tv lacked was the OS(not google/android). But after 3 months I think hisense own OS ""Vida"" is way faster,snappy. Casting your laptop or android phone has no lag. Also has airplay.  Specs are near perfect [in Q3/2024]. Speakers 40wt is good enough. I rarely turn on my home theater unless I neeed that Booom in my living room. Sound is enough to fill a big indian living room.  Only negative: google has more apps. Vida is adding apps but they need pick up some pace. They have all the basic apps you would need. You can run any video audio format via usb. No need to install video players. In jan 2025 these apps as available: Netflix,youtube, disneyplus, prime, sony, zee5, apply, crunchy roll, jio cinema, yupptv.  Most of the other are not for India region. No VPN app that I could find.  Conclusion: worth your money, perfect specs, needs more india based apps, no issues with PS5 or Ps4.",POSITIVE
"This is my second Hisense TV purchase, and I am very pleased once again. The picture quality is excellent. The sound quality is impressive considering the slim build of the TV; the subwoofer is decent, providing enough bass, though it doesn’t quite match the depth of a dedicated subwoofer. So you'll have to go for external speakers if you want that extra thump.  This TV has a lot of features, many of which I haven't tested yet. The Vidaa OS operates smoothly, but the downside with it not being an android/Google TV is the limited availability of apps. I'm a Spotify subscriber and I often listen to music on my old Hisense android tv which seamlessly connects with spotify, but this TV doesn't, which is disappointing. And if you have a Hotstar Premium subscription, you won’t be able to watch content in 4K on this TV for some reason, it only goes upto 1080p. However, I have paired this TV with a Jio STB, so I don't rely on the built-in apps much.  Overall, it’s a very good TV if you primarily want to enjoy your TV channels and some OTT apps.  I'd give it a solid 4.5/5 ⭐",POSITIVE
"I owned a Hisense Television which I was really happy with, and that encouraged me to choose Hisense while I was looking for a bigger size. And with all honesty, I can say that this one's even better. Picture, Sound, Built, even the viewing angles are excellent. Perfect TV at justifyable price",POSITIVE
"The Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers an excellent combination of performance, features, and value. With a large 65-inch screen, it delivers crisp 4K resolution, vibrant colors, and decent contrast. The picture quality is solid for the price, making it a great choice for those who want an affordable yet high-performing TV for watching movies, TV shows, or gaming.  The smart features are intuitive and easy to use, thanks to its Android TV platform, which provides access to a wide variety of streaming services, apps, and built-in voice control with Google Assistant. The TV supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, offering an enhanced viewing experience with deeper blacks and brighter highlights.  In terms of design, the Hisense 65-inch TV has a sleek and modern look, with slim bezels that allow for a more immersive viewing experience. The sound quality is decent, but for an enhanced audio experience, pairing it with an external soundbar or home theater system might be a good idea.  Connectivity options are solid, with multiple HDMI ports, USB inputs, and Wi-Fi support, making it easy to hook up your devices.  Overall, the Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers impressive value for its price, delivering great picture quality, user-friendly smart features, and a modern design. It’s a solid option for anyone looking for a large, budget-friendly smart TV.",POSITIVE
Im super impressed by this tv. Amazing quality crisp sound and video. Lets hope it has longetivity! For now definetly worth every rupee,POSITIVE
"Bought this Q7N Tornado in August 2024. Review after 4 months :- Problem : bright colors causes eye strain. I even tried cinema mode, film maker mode, energy saving mode, standard mode of video but the eyes pain / eyes feel tired after watching the TV from 10-12 feet distance for 1 to 2 hours.  Benefits: Very good picture quality and clarity. 4k is very nice but too bright. Sound quality is very good nothing negative there. Connectivity options are good hdmi, usb, Bluetooth WiFi all connect very well. Vida OS is awesome no lag so far and I need only few apps like Netflix, prime, YouTube, hotstar ,zee5, sonyliv. All these apps are sufficient.  Since the screen is smooth, if you have tubelight or light or window directly opposite face to the TV then you see the reflection/glare of that tubelight or window sun light. Need to make the room darker by curtains or off the tubelight to remove its glare. I wish the screen was with matt anti-glare finishing.  Atleast I hope the company puts out some video settings recommendations to reduce eye strain for watching this TV. My old Samsung LCD 32 inch screen was better and caused no eye strain.",POSITIVE
good quality for a good price,POSITIVE
"Multiple options of audio/video input/output. I can connect my Bluetooth headphones to it. Picture quality is great. Can control with phone via App. Some was saying that it is a bit slow to respond, I don't feel so. View angles are great, colour stays same at any direction. It's worth it money. Using it for 5 months so far.",POSITIVE
"BEST VALUE FOR MONEY, KEPT SEARCHING FOR 6 MONTHS, AND WHEN I PURCHASED IT, I WAS SO SCARED TO REGRET IT!  AND NOW AFTER COUPLE OF MONTHS I CAN CONFIRM I DID NOT REGRET IT! I USE IT ONLY TO WATCH CARTOON FOR KIDS AND ME STREAMING. I HAVE A CHROME CAST, BUT NO LONGER USING IT THE SOFTWARE IS STABLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME USE IT DIRECTLY AND NO CHROME CAST LIKE MY OLD TV  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,",NEGATIVE
"It's worth the price, i realy like this TV E7k 55""!!!picture quality,the tv speaker,for gaming ps5 with 60hz native.hiw fast to navigate on the homescreen.like they say, i recommend this TV with good features that will not break the bank.. But if you have budget for qled like this with 144hz go for it. But for me, from my 7 y/o LG 59"" its a great upgrade and i am satisfied with this TV.",POSITIVE
good in evry thing except it is vivid system not open app sestem program no way to add any app out of vivid stor,NEGATIVE
"I couldn’t be happier with my decision to buy the Hisense Q6N! After spending hours researching online, this TV stood out as the clear winner in its price range. It’s packed with amazing features that truly enhance the viewing experience. The picture quality is stunning, the sound is crisp, and it handles everything I throw at it with ease.  Reviewing after using the TV for 3 months, I can confidently say it has exceeded my expectations. What sealed the deal for me was the availability of service centers nearby, giving me extra peace of mind. So far, it’s been flawless, and I’m loving every moment with it. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium experience without breaking the bank!",POSITIVE
Overall good product. Good picture quality and sound.The television is bit slow while using apps like prime.,POSITIVE
"Display quality of this TV is exzeberant, display is comparable with OLED TV, hd content and 4K content looks like real on TV, sound quality is sufficiently good enough but if you need more bass you should use sound bar. Operation speed is very good , only initially it takes some time to open then scrolling on YouTube channel and other OTT channels are fast, blue connectivity is good enough, ok Google feature and mice features in TV is really useful and user friendly. Most of the OTT apps are default available, Google TV features is good once you login with your Google account you do not have to enter password to any OTT app. Only one downside is it's energy rating is single star but for TV energy rating does not make much difference as it does not consume much energy, pls do your own research on this. Till now overall experience is very good.",POSITIVE
"I’m extremely happy with this television! The picture quality is sharp and vibrant, and the sound is surprisingly good. It was easy to set up, and the smart features work flawlessly. Delivery was quick, and the packaging was secure. Highly recommend this TV for anyone looking for quality and value!",POSITIVE
"I can't say enough good things about my new Hisense TV! From the moment I turned it on, I was amazed by the stunning picture quality. The colors are so vivid, and the sharpness makes everything look lifelike. It feels like I'm at the cinema every time I watch a movie! (sometimes better than theater [watched Kalki and compared] )  The sound quality exceeded my expectations as well. Even without a soundbar, the audio is rich, clear, and fills the room perfectly. Plus, the setup was a breeze—within minutes, I was streaming my favorite shows.  What really stands out is the user-friendly interface. It’s incredibly smooth and easy to navigate, and I love how all the popular streaming apps are already there, ready to go. Hisense has packed this TV with incredible features that rival much more expensive brands, and yet it's so affordable!  Overall, I am beyond happy with my purchase. Hisense has truly delivered an outstanding product, and I would recommend this TV to anyone in a heartbeat. It’s a fantastic choice for anyone looking for top-tier quality without breaking the bank.",POSITIVE
"Pros: The picture quality is great! The build quality is good and It looks great It supports and detects all formats even from pendrive The google os is feature reach, the screen mirroring with android and mac is lag free It's not too great performance wise, but works for me The Blacks are good not great It offers flexibility to change all the settings The PC gaming with HDMI is really smooth and it supports HDR for windows  Cons: Youtube app crashes for 4K HDR videos sometimes It struggles with ""Hey google"" hands free command, and takes too long to respond. Though google assistant with remote is a little faster  I don't turn the tv off instead keep it on stand-by, that helps to deal with slow start-up time",POSITIVE
"Hisense TVs is a solid choice for budget-conscious buyers looking for decent picture quality and smart TV features without breaking the bank. They are particularly well-suited for casual viewing and streaming, though serious gamers or videophiles might notice the absence of some high-end features.  If you're looking for a reliable, affordable TV with good performance for everyday use, Hisense is definitely worth considering.",POSITIVE
"Very nice tv. satisfied with the functionality if u hv a high speed internet it's a go ahead. No lags, user friendly, beautiful picture quality and excellent at this price",POSITIVE

"I bought the 40 inch Smart Acer TV about 2 months back. It's simply awesome for this price. Colours, sound, connectivities. It also has Aux output also to enable connection to headphones thru extended Aux cable having male female ends. Now other family members need not get disturbed with noise. 😊 You can connect external storage, even 2 TB, and see all your Movies. You can even cast from mobile. I recommend Cast to TV X Cast app paid one is only 600 approx one time. So storage is not a hassle. It also has cloud storage option. Build quality, clarity, Support and Performance are outstanding. It's value for money. Don't hesitate. Go for it. 👍",POSITIVE
Satisfied with it but if the coustomer care little bit support then it ok.,POSITIVE
"The 40-inch Acer TV is a great choice. It has clear and bright picture quality, perfect for watching movies or playing games. The slim design looks modern and fits nicely in any room. It also comes with smart features like streaming apps and voice control, which are easy to use.  The sound is good, and you can easily connect other devices like a game console or speakers. Overall, it's a great TV for the price and offers excellent quality and features.",POSITIVE

"I recently purchased the Acer brand TV and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance and picture quality. The service from Acer was seamless, with quick delivery and hassle-free setup.  The picture quality of this TV is outstanding, with vibrant colors, deep blacks, and sharp details. Whether I'm watching movies, gaming, or streaming my favorite shows, the clarity and richness of the visuals never fail to amaze me. Beyond its impressive picture quality, the TV itself is well-designed and sleek, adding a touch of modern elegance to my living room. The interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it a breeze to access my favorite apps and content.  I also appreciate the variety of connectivity options available, including multiple HDMI ports and USB inputs, allowing me to easily connect my devices and accessories. Overall, I highly recommend the Acer brand TV to anyone in the market for a high-quality television. With its exceptional performance, stunning picture quality, and user-friendly features, it's definitely worth the investment.",POSITIVE
Very good picture quality. Price was ok compared to other brands. Installation was also quick.,POSITIVE

"Very poor quality customer service and resolution, I have perched a 43inch led with Foxsky company to saw the 5star rating But when I opened it, it's got cracked and the amazon company wants to sale thease type of defected product to his customer,, it's not a customer value company now its become a froad false advertisement company,,,I will never purchase from Amazon in the future,and also recommend you,, never purchase from Amazon,,",NEGATIVE
"Go head for purchase and enjoy entertainment without stopping..  Compare to other brand, this Tv is good Choice.  For Good experience definitely purchase",POSITIVE
"I recently upgraded to the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV, and I’m quite impressed by what it delivers at its price point. Here’s my personal take:  Picture Quality:  The 4K resolution with Dolby Vision really stands out. Watching UHD content is a treat, with vibrant colors and clear details, especially in brighter scenes. However, when streaming SDR content or older shows, you might notice some graininess, especially on larger screens like the 65-inch model. Adjusting the backlight and saturation can help if you prefer more natural tones, as the default settings can be a bit too vivid for my taste.  Sound:  The 30W speakers are surprisingly good for regular TV viewing, supporting Dolby Audio and DTS. For everyday use, they’re loud and clear enough, but I found the bass to be lacking, so if you're a fan of deep, immersive sound, investing in a soundbar might be a good idea.  User Interface:  Google TV is easy to navigate, and I love how it suggests shows and movies across platforms based on my viewing habits. Plus, Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature is a great addition, giving access to over 200 live channels without extra subscriptions. Switching between apps is generally smooth, though I noticed slight lag after prolonged use, but it’s nothing that impacts the overall experience too much.  Design:  The sleek black design with thin bezels looks great in any room. I opted to mount mine on the wall, which I think suits the larger models better as they can take up a lot of space on a stand. It's not a premium build, but it’s sturdy and fits well with modern interiors.  Smoothness In terms of smoothness, the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV is decent but not flawless. The TV is powered by a quad-core A55 chipset, paired with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. For regular tasks like switching between apps, browsing, and streaming, the performance is generally smooth. However, some users have reported occasional lag, especially after prolonged use or when loading heavier apps. It's not a dealbreaker, but the experience might not be as snappy as higher-end models.  The Google TV interface is a big plus here, as it runs efficiently, with intuitive navigation and quick access to content across various platforms. Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature adds to the smoothness, with seamless integration of live TV and streaming apps into one unified experience.  For basic daily use, the smoothness is acceptable, but if you’re after a flawless, zero-lag experience, you might notice occasional slowdowns with heavy multitasking.  Final Thoughts:  Overall, the Xiaomi X Series delivers excellent value for anyone seeking a 4K TV with smart features at an affordable price. Its picture quality shines with UHD content, and the Google TV integration is intuitive. Just be prepared for some occasional performance hiccups and consider adding external speakers if audio quality is a priority for you.",POSITIVE
"Very good and colourful panel, deep blacks, moderate viewing angles. Metal back feels solid. Speaker is also lound and clear. One con is that TV sometimes get slow and ui frames caps to like 30 hz, but it is rare. Hope this issue gets solved by update. Overall if anyone wants fabulous picture quality this should be a very good option. I got the tv at 21750 during sale, so it is value for money product",POSITIVE
"I bought it in August 2024 the packaging was good damage on executive delivered the product at my doorstep and the check the product whether it was damage or not then after 2 hours MI service centre technician called me for installation and they reach to my home within 1 hour and installed the product but I have to pay it extra 500 rupees for the Wall mount because the Wall mount was not including in the box but that is okay because the Wall mount brand is also MI, functionality of the product is good picture quality is good enough features of the product is good but the space of internal storage is not enough(only 8gb,free space is about 4gb)it should be 16GB or more for internal memory, installation was very quick and we are using the TV for last 2 month for me it's a good product I got it from Amazon at rupees of 20700 and extra 500 I paid for the Wall mount so basically it was a good deal but after that the TV was sold in great Indian festival at rupees of 17700 so I missed the opportunity to buy the product at a low price of that never mind, the product connectivity is good, picture quality was very good just go for it",NEGATIVE
As i purchase this Mi A Pro tv because of new launch and affordable price. As i can see some lag in OS as well as playing any 4k content and the internet speed was slow as i connected it through Hotspot...it was taking some time to load even though my internet speed was 300mbps and the delivery guys carelessly kept this Tv flat in their vehicle but tnx there was no damage rather then everything is good worth buying and i hope they fix some bugs in next update Quick Pros* Excellent Picture Quality Excellent Sound Build quality is good Affordable Price Worth buying  Cons* ( which i faced ) Little lag in OS & 4k content Response time is little slow Stand build quality is not good,NEGATIVE
"The worst ever sound quality. Good display but with performance lag! After a week, sound became weaker than it was in the beginning! No more option to replace the TV or replace with another brand!!",NEGATIVE
"Maha third class tv. I purchased this TV in oct 2024 and by mid december it has dead pixels First of all they dont have easy way of contacting AcerPure Customer Support. Once you connect they will keep you on waitlist by making false commitment of resolution. After sometime Nobody would be responding you over emails, you will be left frustrated. After 1 month they said they would be replacing my old tv with a new one, but dint define the timeline. Later after 2 months, company said that they dont have stock to replace that too after hundreds of emails and being very rude over email, they agreed for refund. If you want full detailed review, you can contact me on nin3 seven six 9 0 61 225.",NEGATIVE
Good product on a budget,POSITIVE
Much better than I expected.,POSITIVE
"This TV offers excellent picture quality with vibrant colors and sharp 4K resolution. Sound is also clear .The smart features are intuitive, with a responsive interface but a limited app store due to the OS. Its sleek design and ample connectivity options are also strong points. it's a solid choice for those seeking a high-quality TV at a reasonable price. Would recommend, especially for casual viewers.",POSITIVE
I have been using this tv since last 3 months and its the best tv anyone can consider at this price range with best 4k gaming features and quality output. It provides great colour and audio quality is also perfect over all sound effects - consist with good function and all expected and used ports - vidaa os is very smooth and with updates i think will provide better options - brightness over 70% feels very adequate and perfect  overall can be considered as the best 4k gaming tv with good refresh rate in budget range of 50-60k,POSITIVE
"Only thing that this tv lacked was the OS(not google/android). But after 3 months I think hisense own OS ""Vida"" is way faster,snappy. Casting your laptop or android phone has no lag. Also has airplay.  Specs are near perfect [in Q3/2024]. Speakers 40wt is good enough. I rarely turn on my home theater unless I neeed that Booom in my living room. Sound is enough to fill a big indian living room.  Only negative: google has more apps. Vida is adding apps but they need pick up some pace. They have all the basic apps you would need. You can run any video audio format via usb. No need to install video players. In jan 2025 these apps as available: Netflix,youtube, disneyplus, prime, sony, zee5, apply, crunchy roll, jio cinema, yupptv.  Most of the other are not for India region. No VPN app that I could find.  Conclusion: worth your money, perfect specs, needs more india based apps, no issues with PS5 or Ps4.",POSITIVE
"This is my second Hisense TV purchase, and I am very pleased once again. The picture quality is excellent. The sound quality is impressive considering the slim build of the TV; the subwoofer is decent, providing enough bass, though it doesn’t quite match the depth of a dedicated subwoofer. So you'll have to go for external speakers if you want that extra thump.  This TV has a lot of features, many of which I haven't tested yet. The Vidaa OS operates smoothly, but the downside with it not being an android/Google TV is the limited availability of apps. I'm a Spotify subscriber and I often listen to music on my old Hisense android tv which seamlessly connects with spotify, but this TV doesn't, which is disappointing. And if you have a Hotstar Premium subscription, you won’t be able to watch content in 4K on this TV for some reason, it only goes upto 1080p. However, I have paired this TV with a Jio STB, so I don't rely on the built-in apps much.  Overall, it’s a very good TV if you primarily want to enjoy your TV channels and some OTT apps.  I'd give it a solid 4.5/5 ⭐",POSITIVE
"I owned a Hisense Television which I was really happy with, and that encouraged me to choose Hisense while I was looking for a bigger size. And with all honesty, I can say that this one's even better. Picture, Sound, Built, even the viewing angles are excellent. Perfect TV at justifyable price",POSITIVE
"The Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers an excellent combination of performance, features, and value. With a large 65-inch screen, it delivers crisp 4K resolution, vibrant colors, and decent contrast. The picture quality is solid for the price, making it a great choice for those who want an affordable yet high-performing TV for watching movies, TV shows, or gaming.  The smart features are intuitive and easy to use, thanks to its Android TV platform, which provides access to a wide variety of streaming services, apps, and built-in voice control with Google Assistant. The TV supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, offering an enhanced viewing experience with deeper blacks and brighter highlights.  In terms of design, the Hisense 65-inch TV has a sleek and modern look, with slim bezels that allow for a more immersive viewing experience. The sound quality is decent, but for an enhanced audio experience, pairing it with an external soundbar or home theater system might be a good idea.  Connectivity options are solid, with multiple HDMI ports, USB inputs, and Wi-Fi support, making it easy to hook up your devices.  Overall, the Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers impressive value for its price, delivering great picture quality, user-friendly smart features, and a modern design. It’s a solid option for anyone looking for a large, budget-friendly smart TV.",POSITIVE
Im super impressed by this tv. Amazing quality crisp sound and video. Lets hope it has longetivity! For now definetly worth every rupee,POSITIVE
"Bought this Q7N Tornado in August 2024. Review after 4 months :- Problem : bright colors causes eye strain. I even tried cinema mode, film maker mode, energy saving mode, standard mode of video but the eyes pain / eyes feel tired after watching the TV from 10-12 feet distance for 1 to 2 hours.  Benefits: Very good picture quality and clarity. 4k is very nice but too bright. Sound quality is very good nothing negative there. Connectivity options are good hdmi, usb, Bluetooth WiFi all connect very well. Vida OS is awesome no lag so far and I need only few apps like Netflix, prime, YouTube, hotstar ,zee5, sonyliv. All these apps are sufficient.  Since the screen is smooth, if you have tubelight or light or window directly opposite face to the TV then you see the reflection/glare of that tubelight or window sun light. Need to make the room darker by curtains or off the tubelight to remove its glare. I wish the screen was with matt anti-glare finishing.  Atleast I hope the company puts out some video settings recommendations to reduce eye strain for watching this TV. My old Samsung LCD 32 inch screen was better and caused no eye strain.",POSITIVE
good quality for a good price,POSITIVE
"Multiple options of audio/video input/output. I can connect my Bluetooth headphones to it. Picture quality is great. Can control with phone via App. Some was saying that it is a bit slow to respond, I don't feel so. View angles are great, colour stays same at any direction. It's worth it money. Using it for 5 months so far.",POSITIVE
"BEST VALUE FOR MONEY, KEPT SEARCHING FOR 6 MONTHS, AND WHEN I PURCHASED IT, I WAS SO SCARED TO REGRET IT!  AND NOW AFTER COUPLE OF MONTHS I CAN CONFIRM I DID NOT REGRET IT! I USE IT ONLY TO WATCH CARTOON FOR KIDS AND ME STREAMING. I HAVE A CHROME CAST, BUT NO LONGER USING IT THE SOFTWARE IS STABLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME USE IT DIRECTLY AND NO CHROME CAST LIKE MY OLD TV  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,",NEGATIVE
"It's worth the price, i realy like this TV E7k 55""!!!picture quality,the tv speaker,for gaming ps5 with 60hz native.hiw fast to navigate on the homescreen.like they say, i recommend this TV with good features that will not break the bank.. But if you have budget for qled like this with 144hz go for it. But for me, from my 7 y/o LG 59"" its a great upgrade and i am satisfied with this TV.",POSITIVE
good in evry thing except it is vivid system not open app sestem program no way to add any app out of vivid stor,NEGATIVE
"Overall a value product (75 inch) with very good quality. Happy with the sound and screen brightness. Design could have been sleeker, yet Google TV makes it worth it",POSITIVE
Writing this review after 15 days of use I got the 55inch C61b for rs 31739 effective without no cost emi discount. For that price its a steal deal!! Pros: Sound - the 35w onkyo speaker system on this tv is beast. You won’t need a soundbar if your room is below 150 sqft. The bass is good. The sound clarity is superb. No distortion even in higher volumes. Best speaker system that I have seen in a tv. Picture- its a VA qled panel The picture quality is very good Blacks are deep Colours are punchy No complaints with picture fully satisfied The google tv os is very responsive with minor lags only after booting which goes away after sometimes. Dolby vision HDR HLG HDR10+ supports are there You need to adjust few settings to avoid motion smoothening issue Gaming mode is also there  Cons The con I felt is the little backlight bleeding on edges which you won’t notice normally But visible in grey screens not in black So not a big issue Installation is very late I got call after 8th day for installation  Overall this is the best tv you can buy under 40k Go for 55 inch or above the onkyo sound is superb Will definitely recommend,POSITIVE
TCL is very good picture quality with affordable price for this QLED TV and very nice audio experience. This TV is equal of samsung and sony and LG TV picture quality.  Worth product,POSITIVE
"Its a review of the 55 inch tv!!! PROS: 1. Design: With minimum bezels, its an updated design, feels premium by the sleek edges. 2. Display: The TV supports DOLBY vision, 4k with QLED. If you are upgrading from an HD tv, you are going to be blown away by the colour output it generates. The colour contrast with deep blacks is quite amazing. I personally haven't tried game mode so cannot comment. I have tried connecting my gaming laptop in HDMI, played FC24, it feels good by the amazing 55 inches display. The tv is quite bright even in sunny daylight. Viewing angle is also good. 3. Sound: The TV comes with a 20W speaker in the back, has a good bass and is quite loud. If you are music enthusiast, you won't be impressed. Its loud and clear and satisfactory when compared to other tv's in the market. No distortion even at 100% volume. 4. Connectivity: Wifi connectivity is good. I use my 5G phone for internet connection with unlimited pack. No lagging issues at all and its a GOOGLE TV so you get maximum app support. CONS: 1. Display: If you are a sports lover, you would be disappointed. The tv has jittering issues and motion clarity isn't good when it comes to sports. High action scenes with fast movement is where the tv lags. When watching cricket, the motion clarity isn't good enough. FINAL VERDICT: I bought this 55 inch tv for 34k. In this price point, you surely won't be disappointed at all. Its the best OLED TV you can find in the market. Trust me, even SAMSUNG, LG and SONY fails when compared with price. I personally visited Relaince Digital before buying the TV online. I compared all the TV's and bought this after thorough research. Buy this tv and you wouldn't regret at all. The only CON isn't a deal breaker at all. I love watching cricket and its ok with the jittering. I am pretty satisfied with the overall experience. I recommend buying the 4k pack of OTT's like Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime. You would love the overall viewing experience of watching movies and series in this huge display.",POSITIVE
I rarely give a 5 star .. It got amazing picture quality and decent soundd quality... The tv runs pretty fast and the blacks are so deep... Good upscaling... Best under 40k for 43inches tv,POSITIVE

"Our old LG tv was past it's best and with strong sunlight the picture was very dark. We looked at TCL and Hisense in Currys but they didn't really seem interested in selling us one and were trying to push expensive Samsung's onto us. We didn't want to spend that much so retired to Costa for a coffee. Whilst there I looked on Amazon and noticed the price of the 50"" TCL had dropped to £299 so went for it, the Currys price was £374 at the time.  So far it has been very good with excellent picture quality, however this is an Android tv and setting it up was a pain with not much help from the manual. Altogether it took two days messing around to get a decent setup! Android is a mobile phone operating system owned by Google, so they really push you to either log in to your Google account or set one up. I'm not the greatest fan of Google because it wants to know too much of your business but there are a few videos on YouTube (also owned by Google!) about setting it up as a standalone. On all my old tv's you scan for channels and it works, not any more so beware.  Once I'd scanned all the channels in (nearly 1000!) the picture went to a ""Home screen"" and I hadn't got a clue what to do next. Eventually by a matter of trial and error and just pushing buttons on the remote I got onto a channel list and got Freeview to work, please note there is no built in Freesat on this as there was on our old LG. The channels were all over the place with BBC at about channel 45. Lots of channels didn't work with a message saying some dongle or other wasn't installed and to be honest I was not very impressed at the end of day 1.  On day 2 I decided to re-scan the channels and noticed a few options so opted for ""Free only"". This made a big difference and the ""dongle"" channels had disappeared. The channels were all still mixed up and then I noticed the channel list was in alphabetical order, so ITV was way down the list. This was getting more and more frustrating by the minute until I found a channel organizer in the settings. This brings up the channel list again but using the remote it's possible to click on a channel which brings an option box up. One of the options is ""Move"", by clicking on this option then clicking on another channel number the first channel moves to the new position. So I was able to move BBC1 to channel 1 and then spent the next few hours moving dozens of other channels as well. There is a ""Favourites"" option but I still haven't worked that one out yet.  Is it a good tv? I would say yes but be prepared for a lot of faffing about unless you are a wizz kid geek. I still haven't worked it all out but have got it so it's watchable but even now after a few weeks I still get confused by it, mainly trying to get from the home screen onto normal channels.",NEGATIVE

Pros: Sound - the 35w onkyo speaker system on this tv is beast. You won’t need a soundbar if your room is below 150 sqft. The bass is good. The sound clarity is superb. No distortion even in higher volumes. Best speaker system that I have seen in a tv. Picture- its a VA qled panel The picture quality is very good Blacks are deep Colours are punchy No complaints with picture fully satisfied The google tv os is very responsive with minor lags only after booting which goes away after sometimes. Dolby vision HDR HLG HDR10+ supports are there You need to adjust few settings to avoid motion smoothening issue Gaming mode is also there  Cons The con I felt is the little backlight bleeding on edges which you won’t notice normally But visible in grey screens not in black So not a big issue Installation is very late I got call after 8th day for installation  Overall this is the best tv you can buy under 40k Go for 55 inch or above the onkyo sound is superb Will definitely recommend,POSITIVE
TCL is very good picture quality with affordable price for this QLED TV and very nice audio experience. This TV is equal of samsung and sony and LG TV picture quality.  Worth product,POSITIVE
"Its a review of the 55 inch tv!!! PROS: 1. Design: With minimum bezels, its an updated design, feels premium by the sleek edges. 2. Display: The TV supports DOLBY vision, 4k with QLED. If you are upgrading from an HD tv, you are going to be blown away by the colour output it generates. The colour contrast with deep blacks is quite amazing. I personally haven't tried game mode so cannot comment. I have tried connecting my gaming laptop in HDMI, played FC24, it feels good by the amazing 55 inches display. The tv is quite bright even in sunny daylight. Viewing angle is also good. 3. Sound: The TV comes with a 20W speaker in the back, has a good bass and is quite loud. If you are music enthusiast, you won't be impressed. Its loud and clear and satisfactory when compared to other tv's in the market. No distortion even at 100% volume. 4. Connectivity: Wifi connectivity is good. I use my 5G phone for internet connection with unlimited pack. No lagging issues at all and its a GOOGLE TV so you get maximum app support. CONS: 1. Display: If you are a sports lover, you would be disappointed. The tv has jittering issues and motion clarity isn't good when it comes to sports. High action scenes with fast movement is where the tv lags. When watching cricket, the motion clarity isn't good enough. FINAL VERDICT: I bought this 55 inch tv for 34k. In this price point, you surely won't be disappointed at all. Its the best OLED TV you can find in the market. Trust me, even SAMSUNG, LG and SONY fails when compared with price. I personally visited Relaince Digital before buying the TV online. I compared all the TV's and bought this after thorough research. Buy this tv and you wouldn't regret at all. The only CON isn't a deal breaker at all. I love watching cricket and its ok with the jittering. I am pretty satisfied with the overall experience. I recommend buying the 4k pack of OTT's like Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime. You would love the overall viewing experience of watching movies and series in this huge display.",POSITIVE
I rarely give a 5 star .. It got amazing picture quality and decent soundd quality... The tv runs pretty fast and the blacks are so deep... Good upscaling... Best under 40k for 43inches tv,POSITIVE
Product is good but installation guys were in hurry..as they are service provider also hence not raised any complaint..,NEGATIVE
After using 3 weeks i must say I chosen the best 4K TV with the price best sound best picture quality best configuration best product best 4K best colours on the TV,POSITIVE
"I bought this TV for watching in my home. I like the build and the sleek design. One Important matter I want to bring to your notice is that communication within Amazon to its customers are leaking out....... After delivery, I was informed by Amazon that the technician will come the next day (Sunday) who didn't turn up. After that, I got another intimation from Amazon stating that a new technician will come the NEXT day for installation. He did. However, in between I got an anonymous call from UK stating that they are calling from Amazon and informed me of the technician's visit and asked me to confirm by pressing 1 or 9 to cancel.....!!!! I ignored the call. This is just for your information to take up matter within so as to plug any loophole in your communication leakage.",NEGATIVE
"I haven't used an android/google TV before. If you're already a heavy youtube user, the TV is for you. The picture quality is great despite its price, it delivers great value for your money. This TV is a price - performance monster, I can honestly say.",POSITIVE
"TV was okay initially but started running slowly after a couple months. The menu scrolling lags so much and TV restarts evertime I start apps like netflix. I have kept the software up to date and done all sorts of trouble shooting with no fix. Picture and sound quality are excellent but TV is so laggy and unpredictable. I would have returned it, but window is closed.",NEGATIVE
"Our old LG tv was past it's best and with strong sunlight the picture was very dark. We looked at TCL and Hisense in Currys but they didn't really seem interested in selling us one and were trying to push expensive Samsung's onto us. We didn't want to spend that much so retired to Costa for a coffee. Whilst there I looked on Amazon and noticed the price of the 50"" TCL had dropped to £299 so went for it, the Currys price was £374 at the time.  So far it has been very good with excellent picture quality, however this is an Android tv and setting it up was a pain with not much help from the manual. Altogether it took two days messing around to get a decent setup! Android is a mobile phone operating system owned by Google, so they really push you to either log in to your Google account or set one up. I'm not the greatest fan of Google because it wants to know too much of your business but there are a few videos on YouTube (also owned by Google!) about setting it up as a standalone. On all my old tv's you scan for channels and it works, not any more so beware.  Once I'd scanned all the channels in (nearly 1000!) the picture went to a ""Home screen"" and I hadn't got a clue what to do next. Eventually by a matter of trial and error and just pushing buttons on the remote I got onto a channel list and got Freeview to work, please note there is no built in Freesat on this as there was on our old LG. The channels were all over the place with BBC at about channel 45. Lots of channels didn't work with a message saying some dongle or other wasn't installed and to be honest I was not very impressed at the end of day 1.  On day 2 I decided to re-scan the channels and noticed a few options so opted for ""Free only"". This made a big difference and the ""dongle"" channels had disappeared. The channels were all still mixed up and then I noticed the channel list was in alphabetical order, so ITV was way down the list. This was getting more and more frustrating by the minute until I found a channel organizer in the settings. This brings up the channel list again but using the remote it's possible to click on a channel which brings an option box up. One of the options is ""Move"", by clicking on this option then clicking on another channel number the first channel moves to the new position. So I was able to move BBC1 to channel 1 and then spent the next few hours moving dozens of other channels as well. There is a ""Favourites"" option but I still haven't worked that one out yet.  Is it a good tv? I would say yes but be prepared for a lot of faffing about unless you are a wizz kid geek. I still haven't worked it all out but have got it so it's watchable but even now after a few weeks I still get confused by it, mainly trying to get from the home screen onto normal channels.",NEGATIVE
Superb value great picture quality easy set up migration,POSITIVE
"I received the TV brand new, after i removed the tape, i saw that there are two huge dots where the pixels are dead.",NEGATIVE

"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE
Samsung products are good. Installation service is also good. Performance and display quality is very best. Really value for money. I bought this with the brand name.,POSITIVE
"Background : I was in search for a good but not pricey TV because of the following  1. My Samsung 49"" K6300 Curved TV had gone kaput in 4-5 years (DOP - Somewhere in 2017 - early 2018) 2. I was dragging my old TV with ever growing shadows accompanied with visibility issues. 3. K6300 was an eye pleasure when in good condition with amazing blacks and motion smoothness - beautiful out of the box colors.  Since a Tier 1 brand like Samsung had betrayed the trust after paying a premium , I was in the lookout of a mid range TV with up-to-date features - my check list included the following  1. Solid warranty clause with no Money extorsion policies like LG OLED post 1 year end. 2. Good sound system - Preferably with a sub-woofer. 3. Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.  I think I am tending to increase ratings from 4 to 5 stars. Just for the REGZA Pic & Sound from Toshiba.  Good and durable Japanese brands Like Sanyo, Toshiba, Panasonic ( that bring in proprietary tech) should be endorsed (even thought they may be manufactured locally under strategic partnerships) by the Indians else everything is gonna be PRC/Korea Inspired.",POSITIVE
"Initially I want to buy infinix qled t.v because of earlier experience with the brand was good moreover it was 8000 Rs economical to Toshiba but I switch over to Toshiba because of brand reputation most of the well-known brands like infinix,Motorola,Kodak,Blaupunkt, Thomson etc. used to market third party manufacturers product though I am not certain Toshiba manufacturer this t.v or it is also playing the same game but I take a bet because of goodwill and three years of warranty which no other brand is providing.I have been using the t.v for three months I have following observations about this t.v- 1-Picture quality is great (Good contrast,Punchy colours, Wide colour gamut,No screen bleeding issues,Deeper black level) can be good or at par with brands like Samsung,LG, Panasonic inferior to Sony) so there is no comparison with other brands they will fall short. 2- Toshiba's proprietary Regza chip is damm fast as well as do best upscaling moreover it's own ui makes it fast in comparison to android t.v's present in the market don't compare it's ram and rom because it can do it's work swiftly in comparision with brands having double ram and rom nodoubt because of rom storage can be issue for some. 3- Sound quality is great to me it varies person to person vocals are clear and crisp, lacking bass and surround experience is great.sound is pleasing in most of scenarios like 4k movies, webseries,games,news, loudness is sufficient for room 12×15 size of room is at par with Samsung and LG t.v's of this size. 4- settings menu is easily operable, build quality is good,great aesthetics with well built functional remote. Can be improved -. 1- Bass 2-behaves like va panel so viewing angles are not that great but not that much colour shift is seen. After one month see my video review of this t.v on my YouTube channel shobhits exact evaluation .",POSITIVE
"I've had this TV now for near 4 months. The positives are that the build quality, picture quality & sound quality are all great. The only two negatives are the OS & the lack of Filmmaker mode. So I recommend getting a FireTV device or a similar device to remedy the OS issue; the lack of Filmmaker mode means you will need to manually adjust the picture quality to give you the best viewing experience possible. Having said this the TV is still a very good buy at the price.",POSITIVE
"Toshiba TVs are known for their exceptional picture quality and impressive performance. The vibrant colors, sharp details, and smooth motion make the viewing experience truly enjoyable.

Giveing review after 1 month of use Pros- Overally video and audio Clearity is awesome. Value for money. Cons- In high moving object like while watching cricket observe when ball moves faster it gets blur some time it's seems 2-3 ball are moves faster back to back like that. In short MEMC not provided or not working properly. But it's not big issue,POSITIVE
"The performance of the Toshiba TV is excellent! The picture quality is vibrant, the sound is crisp, and the overall experience has been great. However, the installation process could have been better. While the setup was completed, one side of the TV is slightly tilted down, which was a bit disappointing.  Despite this minor issue, the TV itself delivers an outstanding viewing experience, and I’m very satisfied with the product. Highly recommend it for its performance!",POSITIVE
"The TV is awsome, very nice picture quality and dolby atmos is too good. At this price point you can't ask for more. Yes in comparison to all Android tv this is a bit slow but faster than the rest.  Important part- I read many negative comments or reviews regarding installation failure. The same happened with me, however with constant communication with Amazon they helped me to get the tv installed within the scheduled time. Yes if you are polite enough anyone will help you out.  There are reviews regarding the tv shutting down itself after some time. The same thing happened with me. But it's a energy saving feature of the TV, if you keep it in idle condition it will shutdown. That is a good feature. But illeterate consumers doesn't understand nor study the manual before posting such reviews. It's an awsome tv go for it",NEGATIVE
"TV is a good buy at this price point. Picture quality could have been better, sound is clear and loud. Overall a nice tv.",POSITIVE
"Positives: overall good performance, 2 years of warranty.  Negatives: White light bleeding at the edges of screen very clearly visible in grey screen.",NEGATIVE
"At this price range this is the only TV maybe which has 2 GB RAM, others come at 1 or 1.5 GB RAM. So as a Smart TV you are able to get a glitch free interface.",NEGATIVE

Variety: VU offers a wide range of TVs, from basic LED models to high-end QLEDs with Dolby Vision and HDR10 support. 4. Smart Features: Most VU TVs run Android TV OS, providing access to Google Play Store, Google Assistant, and Chromecast. 5. Build Quality: Decent build quality for the price, with sleek designs that compete with higher-end brands.  Cons:  1. Sound Quality: Audio performance, while serviceable, might not be as robust as higher-end brands. You may need a soundbar for better audio clarity. 2. Motion Handling: In some models, motion blur can be noticeable during fast-paced scenes. 3. Customer Support: Mixed reviews on after-sales service and support in some regions. 4. Software Updates: Updates can sometimes be slower compared to more established brands.  As I mentioned above I’ve been Using VU for Last 7 Years I’ve upgrade my TV for 3 Times within this 7 Years.

"IF you wish to face these troubles which i experienced then only buy this product :  This Company is full of fraud activities. 1) First its LED unit installer delayed a lot and caused so many issue to me which was resolved after several complaints with Amazon. 2) Apps which should be installed, were not already installed. 3) With in 3-4 months , low quality remote started showing issue and i am told that remote is not under warranty while there was no wear and tear, it just not working properly..",NEGATIVE
"Features are of smart TV. Very good remote control. Picture quality is Ok Ok. Not that great. But definitely it is value for money. I am using it for CCTV, sometimes watch YT and Netflix. Audio quality is OK. At this price point it is very good to have it for secondary use like CCTV monitoring or for continuous office displays.",POSITIVE

Remote normally ok. Amazon and vw provided good customer support and services. Good to buy this tv with this 13k budget. Long term useage wait and see I will update...,NEGATIVE
Like it's quality in price point but everything is just as good as per price not best. Remote is an issue and can be better,POSITIVE
"Worst product I ever purchased, the screen has completely blacked out within a week, I claimed warranty support two months ago, so far there is no progress at all, some random technician messaged me over watsapp half a month ago enquiring about the details of the issue and generated a complaint number, he never showed up his phone is switched off, another technician messaged me yesterday giving his introduction on assistance, I called him today and he says ""I am on leave today some other technician will come"". I think this brand will cease to exist soon. They don't just care about service their only concern is about selling their defective product as fast as they can.",NEGATIVE
Quality is good & voice is.amazing,POSITIVE
Bhai ye bhut hi cheap hai aur ye hamare budget ke hisab se bhut hi sasta hai to agar aapka budget kam ho to ye hi le varna na le Qki ye hamari personality pe suit nahi karta.... 😜,NEGATIVE
"Best tv with latest display tech..but I have short sight..so QLED or Neo QLED or 4K , 8K doesn't make much difference to me...also human eyes itna distinguish nahi kar paayega..so though it's very cheap and affordable, it's of no use because of my eyes capability to read each pixel..so I'm going to cry a little for not buying this affordable tv",NEGATIVE
So cheap... I cancelled my order... Buying this cheap product is beneath my dignity so I cancelled my order .... If your budget is low only then you can go for it others I won't recommend for this cheap product,NEGATIVE

Good product,POSITIVE
"The TV itself is good, and I’ve owned TCL products before without issues. However, purchasing high-value items from Amazon comes with serious risks due to their poor post-purchase support.  Installation was repeatedly delayed, and despite multiple follow-ups, no resolution was provided. Customer support was unprofessional, unhelpful, and unwilling to take ownership of the issue. I ultimately had to return the product—not because of TCL, but due to Amazon’s failure to provide the necessary service.  If you’re considering buying expensive electronics here, be prepared for a frustrating experience if you ever need support.",NEGATIVE
Good quality for this price. If u choose other brands you have to pay ₹5000 to 15000 extra .,POSITIVE
"I bought TCL 75 inches 4K UHD LED TV after lot of research on specifications and price bargain.  This TV is really a catch @ Rs 69,990 when I bought in December 2023. Great deal on 75 inches TV. Thanks to TCL.  Moreover, the colours and brightness and viewing pleasure is really very satisfactory.  I was dreaming to buy Mini LED TV but it was very costly and out of my budget. So I closed down on this great value for money deal on TCL 75 inches giant screen TV at an amazing price tag of Rs 69,990.  Sound is 30W RMS. It's really crystal clear and very good to listen each minute audio detail. I have a soundbar but now no need to use it as the TV sound is almost like a soundbar and it's powerful.  TV has got HDMI eARC connectivity. I am using soundbar as well as Sony wireless headphone L600 - both with eARC connectivity. So it was super easy to connect my soundbar as well as wireles headphone with TCL TV seamlessly.  The remote controller unit is also very nice. It's bit slim and long which looks different from other brands and easy to handle. All required shortcut buttons are given.  It's a Google TV. So supports Google voice search.  We are very happy on our decision to buy TCL 75 inches 4K UHD TV.  I hope this TV will serve us for few years to come without any technical problems. I will post my post use feedback soon in next year 2024.  Thank you.",POSITIVE
TCL is affordable price very good picture quality this TV equal samsung & Sony viewing experience,POSITIVE
Quality is very good.,POSITIVE
"We bought the TV 3 months back. In a month, the TV started getting hanged and did not work smoothly. Even after following all the instructions, the problem didn't get solved. Also the after service of the company is pathetic. When we asked to replace the product, they denied and did made reasons like technician will come and check the product. It's been more than 20 days we are trying to reach th but no one is responding to our complaint. Also the customer care number that is mentioned is of no use as no one answered or addressed our complaint. There is Lag, poor picture quality before the TV started getting hanged. And now TV is not working at all. It's stuck on TCL logo and keeping getting restart, doesn't go ahead of it. Never buy or go for TCL products as they don't respond or replace the product even when it's in the warranty period.  Just because it's less price, don't buy it as money gets wasted. Better to put extra and buy another brand.",NEGATIVE
Nice tv but it do not come with wall Mount,NEGATIVE
"Value For Money, Picture Clarity & Sound Quality Is Really Really Awesome Really I Liked This Product Quality Of Product is No.1 Installation Is Also Very Simple Size & Design Altimate.",POSITIVE
"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE
Samsung products are good. Installation service is also good. Performance and display quality is very best. Really value for money. I bought this with the brand name.,POSITIVE
"I bought a 55 inches tv , picture quality is awesome and sound quality is also good.",POSITIVE
"Delivery people are not at all cooperative worst delivery,product also not that good as far shown by the company,no service,no person came for installation,sound not that good,too bright. Worst part is company is not at all supportive do not buy.!",NEGATIVE
Big good tv Easy to use Mirroring is present Voice control is the best feature Morever its easy to handle and use,POSITIVE
"The TV is excellent! The Size, the HDR brightness, everything, its excellent. It Is a little slow in response, I believe it needs a couple GB's of RAM extra, but not a deal breaker, its responsive enough. Theres some light bleed from bottom left and right, but not enough to distract form whats being displayed in the screen (Unless the picture is completely black)  But the sound, even after attaching a soundbar (I have a SONY H-S20R) I need to be all the way at 70-80 to enjoy the audio, or even be audible in dialogues.  It might be a problem with my HDMI, but I doubt that.  It might be a problem with my TV too, but I can't tell now, can I? Overall, I am not disappointed with the product. I'll try the Optical Audio if the sound improves and edit this review later with the update.  Overall, the installation was quick, I was proactively asked by their CC if the installation was complete or even delivered on time, no complaints about the picture quality, Would recommend!",NEGATIVE
"Good picture quality and sound,",POSITIVE
TV I have purchased it was defective it was replaced but but yet be received,NEGATIVE
"I would rate this product 4.8 out of 5 based on my usage in the last few weeks, and for the price paid. The technology looks solid so far, and it has a good array of smart features for regular use. Amazon's delivery service and subsequent installation of the product by the seller have been prompt and professional. I wish I can set English subtitles (for foreign languages programs) through the TV settings, which is the only limitation I have noticed so far.",POSITIVE
I need how to solve this problem.. Can you customer care number..,NEGATIVE
ver good product,POSITIVE
"Background : I was in search for a good but not pricey TV because of the following  1. My Samsung 49"" K6300 Curved TV had gone kaput in 4-5 years (DOP - Somewhere in 2017 - early 2018) 2. I was dragging my old TV with ever growing shadows accompanied with visibility issues. 3. K6300 was an eye pleasure when in good condition with amazing blacks and motion smoothness - beautiful out of the box colors.  Since a Tier 1 brand like Samsung had betrayed the trust after paying a premium , I was in the lookout of a mid range TV with up-to-date features - my check list included the following  1. Solid warranty clause with no Money extorsion policies like LG OLED post 1 year end. 2. Good sound system - Preferably with a sub-woofer. 3. Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.  I think I am tending to increase ratings from 4 to 5 stars. Just for the REGZA Pic & Sound from Toshiba.  Good and durable Japanese brands Like Sanyo, Toshiba, Panasonic ( that bring in proprietary tech) should be endorsed (even thought they may be manufactured locally under strategic partnerships) by the Indians else everything is gonna be PRC/Korea Inspired.",POSITIVE
"Initially I want to buy infinix qled t.v because of earlier experience with the brand was good moreover it was 8000 Rs economical to Toshiba but I switch over to Toshiba because of brand reputation most of the well-known brands like infinix,Motorola,Kodak,Blaupunkt, Thomson etc. used to market third party manufacturers product though I am not certain Toshiba manufacturer this t.v or it is also playing the same game but I take a bet because of goodwill and three years of warranty which no other brand is providing.I have been using the t.v for three months I have following observations about this t.v- 1-Picture quality is great (Good contrast,Punchy colours, Wide colour gamut,No screen bleeding issues,Deeper black level) can be good or at par with brands like Samsung,LG, Panasonic inferior to Sony) so there is no comparison with other brands they will fall short. 2- Toshiba's proprietary Regza chip is damm fast as well as do best upscaling moreover it's own ui makes it fast in comparison to android t.v's present in the market don't compare it's ram and rom because it can do it's work swiftly in comparision with brands having double ram and rom nodoubt because of rom storage can be issue for some. 3- Sound quality is great to me it varies person to person vocals are clear and crisp, lacking bass and surround experience is great.sound is pleasing in most of scenarios like 4k movies, webseries,games,news, loudness is sufficient for room 12×15 size of room is at par with Samsung and LG t.v's of this size. 4- settings menu is easily operable, build quality is good,great aesthetics with well built functional remote. Can be improved -. 1- Bass 2-behaves like va panel so viewing angles are not that great but not that much colour shift is seen. After one month see my video review of this t.v on my YouTube channel shobhits exact evaluation .",POSITIVE
"I've had this TV now for near 4 months. The positives are that the build quality, picture quality & sound quality are all great. The only two negatives are the OS & the lack of Filmmaker mode. So I recommend getting a FireTV device or a similar device to remedy the OS issue; the lack of Filmmaker mode means you will need to manually adjust the picture quality to give you the best viewing experience possible. Having said this the TV is still a very good buy at the price.",POSITIVE
"I was thinking to get a car for roaming around, but then I came across this. I bought this one and now I'm able to experience the world on this 8k monitor... Life is better now... No risk of car accident... No petrol no maintenance...",POSITIVE

"I purchased a VU TV last month and I am extremely happy with my decision. The picture quality is outstanding, with vibrant colors and crisp details, making movie nights an absolute delight. The sound is clear and immersive, eliminating the need for an external speaker in most cases.  The smart TV features work flawlessly, with smooth navigation and quick app loading. The connectivity options are also impressive, allowing me to seamlessly connect my devices. The build quality feels premium, and the sleek design adds elegance to my living space.  Overall, this VU TV offers exceptional performance at a budget-friendly price. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a high-quality viewing experience!",POSITIVE
One of the best tv’s in this range. Best Audio and video clarity. Vey sleek and impressive design. Must Buy!!,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this TV from Amazon. The delivery was prompt, and the packaging was secure, ensuring the product arrived in perfect condition. The TV itself exceeds expectations, with stunning picture quality, vibrant colors, and crystal-clear sound. Setting it up was a breeze, and the smart features work flawlessly, making streaming and navigation incredibly convenient.  I’ve enjoyed watching my favorite movies and shows with an immersive experience, and the sleek design adds a modern touch to my living room. Overall, this TV is fantastic value for money. Highly recommend purchasing it from Amazon for a smooth and reliable shopping experience!",POSITIVE
"This is my first VU TV, and I can confidently say that best choice to choose this brand.  Display and Performance: The 55” VU Vibe TV comes with a ips panel that delivers vibrant, punchy colors, along with deep blacks and rich contrast. HDR content on OTT platforms looks stunning, and even without Dolby Vision support, the content still appears highly impressive.  Operating System and Usability: The performance is smooth and reliable.  Connectivity: The TV provides a solid range of connectivity options, including 2 USB ports (1 USB 3.0 and 1 USB 2.0) and 4 HDMI ports, one of which supports ARC/eARC for seamless audio integration.  Audio Quality: The sound quality is excellent, with clear vocals and an integrated soundbar that delivers loud, crisp audio. Although it doesn’t produce room-shaking bass, the clarity and Dolby Audio processing ensure a great listening experience.  Design: The TV features a sleek, premium design that adds a touch of elegance to any room.  Overall, I’m very satisfied with both the product and VU’s service. It's a great value for the price, and I’m happy to give it a 5-star rating.",POSITIVE
"I am writing this review after using this tv for more than a month. I am fully satisfied with my VU tv. Here are the pros: QLED Peak brightness Sound bar and it's clarity Smart TV and no lagging when logging to Google tv Voice remote works well Amazing picture clarity Wifi works seamless Bluetooth pairing is awesome HDMi ans USB does the job well Different picture and sound modes 4k videos are stunning Cheaper than Samsung, Sony and LG Very good customer support - Amazon tv installation didn't come on time. Brand installation visited the site as promised and i started enjoying this wonderful tv. Cons - Very slippery remote model. You need remote cover to hold it for long I will write more as I experience more features",POSITIVE
"Very good product. Accurate and punchy colours, Good sound quality in the native speaker. Vu is the only mainstream company providing option for 3yr warranty for their TV.",POSITIVE
"VU televisions are well-regarded for offering value for money with a mix of good picture quality, modern features, and competitive pricing. Here’s a detailed review:  Pros:  1. Picture Quality: VU TVs typically offer sharp, vibrant displays with good color reproduction, especially in their 4K and QLED models. 2. Affordable Pricing: They provide features comparable to premium brands like Samsung or LG at a fraction of the cost. 3. Variety: VU offers a wide range of TVs, from basic LED models to high-end QLEDs with Dolby Vision and HDR10 support. 4. Smart Features: Most VU TVs run Android TV OS, providing access to Google Play Store, Google Assistant, and Chromecast. 5. Build Quality: Decent build quality for the price, with sleek designs that compete with higher-end brands.  Cons:  1. Sound Quality: Audio performance, while serviceable, might not be as robust as higher-end brands. You may need a soundbar for better audio clarity. 2. Motion Handling: In some models, motion blur can be noticeable during fast-paced scenes. 3. Customer Support: Mixed reviews on after-sales service and support in some regions. 4. Software Updates: Updates can sometimes be slower compared to more established brands.  As I mentioned above I’ve been Using VU for Last 7 Years I’ve upgrade my TV for 3 Times within this 7 Years. Very Satisfied with the quality and performance till date. thank you.",POSITIVE
"I recently upgraded to the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV, and I’m quite impressed by what it delivers at its price point. Here’s my personal take:  Picture Quality:  The 4K resolution with Dolby Vision really stands out. Watching UHD content is a treat, with vibrant colors and clear details, especially in brighter scenes. However, when streaming SDR content or older shows, you might notice some graininess, especially on larger screens like the 65-inch model. Adjusting the backlight and saturation can help if you prefer more natural tones, as the default settings can be a bit too vivid for my taste.  Sound:  The 30W speakers are surprisingly good for regular TV viewing, supporting Dolby Audio and DTS. For everyday use, they’re loud and clear enough, but I found the bass to be lacking, so if you're a fan of deep, immersive sound, investing in a soundbar might be a good idea.  User Interface:  Google TV is easy to navigate, and I love how it suggests shows and movies across platforms based on my viewing habits. Plus, Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature is a great addition, giving access to over 200 live channels without extra subscriptions. Switching between apps is generally smooth, though I noticed slight lag after prolonged use, but it’s nothing that impacts the overall experience too much.  Design:  The sleek black design with thin bezels looks great in any room. I opted to mount mine on the wall, which I think suits the larger models better as they can take up a lot of space on a stand. It's not a premium build, but it’s sturdy and fits well with modern interiors.  Smoothness In terms of smoothness, the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV is decent but not flawless. The TV is powered by a quad-core A55 chipset, paired with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. For regular tasks like switching between apps, browsing, and streaming, the performance is generally smooth. However, some users have reported occasional lag, especially after prolonged use or when loading heavier apps. It's not a dealbreaker, but the experience might not be as snappy as higher-end models.  The Google TV interface is a big plus here, as it runs efficiently, with intuitive navigation and quick access to content across various platforms. Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature adds to the smoothness, with seamless integration of live TV and streaming apps into one unified experience.  For basic daily use, the smoothness is acceptable, but if you’re after a flawless, zero-lag experience, you might notice occasional slowdowns with heavy multitasking.  Final Thoughts:  Overall, the Xiaomi X Series delivers excellent value for anyone seeking a 4K TV with smart features at an affordable price. Its picture quality shines with UHD content, and the Google TV integration is intuitive. Just be prepared for some occasional performance hiccups and consider adding external speakers if audio quality is a priority for you.",POSITIVE
"Very good and colourful panel, deep blacks, moderate viewing angles. Metal back feels solid. Speaker is also lound and clear. One con is that TV sometimes get slow and ui frames caps to like 30 hz, but it is rare. Hope this issue gets solved by update. Overall if anyone wants fabulous picture quality this should be a very good option. I got the tv at 21750 during sale, so it is value for money product",POSITIVE
"I bought it in August 2024 the packaging was good damage on executive delivered the product at my doorstep and the check the product whether it was damage or not then after 2 hours MI service centre technician called me for installation and they reach to my home within 1 hour and installed the product but I have to pay it extra 500 rupees for the Wall mount because the Wall mount was not including in the box but that is okay because the Wall mount brand is also MI, functionality of the product is good picture quality is good enough features of the product is good but the space of internal storage is not enough(only 8gb,free space is about 4gb)it should be 16GB or more for internal memory, installation was very quick and we are using the TV for last 2 month for me it's a good product I got it from Amazon at rupees of 20700 and extra 500 I paid for the Wall mount so basically it was a good deal but after that the TV was sold in great Indian festival at rupees of 17700 so I missed the opportunity to buy the product at a low price of that never mind, the product connectivity is good, picture quality was very good just go for it",NEGATIVE
As i purchase this Mi A Pro tv because of new launch and affordable price. As i can see some lag in OS as well as playing any 4k content and the internet speed was slow as i connected it through Hotspot...it was taking some time to load even though my internet speed was 300mbps and the delivery guys carelessly kept this Tv flat in their vehicle but tnx there was no damage rather then everything is good worth buying and i hope they fix some bugs in next update Quick Pros* Excellent Picture Quality Excellent Sound Build quality is good Affordable Price Worth buying  Cons* ( which i faced ) Little lag in OS & 4k content Response time is little slow Stand build quality is not good,NEGATIVE
"The worst ever sound quality. Good display but with performance lag! After a week, sound became weaker than it was in the beginning! No more option to replace the TV or replace with another brand!!",NEGATIVE
"This one is hands down best combo of firetv stick and Indian made TV. This is 2020 version (H1F1), which has 20W sound instead of old 16W sound. Picture quality is great, sound is nice. Best part, apps and firetv stick responds so quick that my old Sony smart-tv looks lost in league. First time updates and everything will take time but is easy. Remote is much better than Alexa and Mi. Also supports voice command and screen off while listening music. Tons of apps and regular firmware update. In the end, in this small city ... Onida customer care called, fixed a technician appointment and then tech came. He checked the TV for damages and wrote down the warranty card with direct call number. Chinese... Brands... Go back from India. We have a contender now.",POSITIVE
"I ordered Onida 32 inch after going through several other options available (Mi. etc) Initially, it look some time due to updates, and once done, it started working smoothly. Sound quality is fine (considering 15k price range), Picture quality is nice. This TV 'Fire TV OS', which I found only little bit lag, but manageable. Overall I can say - under 15k, this is a smart and good choice.",POSITIVE

"*1 day review*  Amazon delivered the product within 24 hrs. Person from ONIDA came for installation within 48 hrs as they promised. Completely satisfy with picture and sound quality. (My previous TV was 20yrs old box type tv, so i dont know picture quality of other LED or LCD tv.) Connectivity is also good. No buffering on wifi, mobile casting works fine and faced no issues while using USB pendrives.  I will also upload 6 months review.",POSITIVE
This tv is value for money. It responds really fast to the remote. The picture and sound quality are really nice. You Dont need a sound bar with it. And no such problem of internet connection getting lost. It works so smooth once connected. Overall a very nice tv to buy. I am happy that I bought it after going through all the options. A thumbs up from me.,POSITIVE
"I have bought new TV in December 2020. I am continuously facing the issue of ""Power Drain"" in my New Remote. I realized this problem a month of use after my purchase. I immediately made a complaint to Onida for replacement. It's almost 5 months, I haven't received any replacement from the company. Every time I am following with them to know about replacement and they are ensuring I will receive new remote but not giving any timeline. It's really a painful experience in the after sale service with Onida. Have a second thought about After Sale Service before buying Onida Products. Also Sound fluctuation issue (sometimes suddenly sound ups and down) and voice recognition issue with remote, was raised service request with in warranty period. Service guys (2 members) visited my place, and upgraded software and checked remote, reset the remote. and as they have suggested batteries draining issue will check after 2 days observation. Later no update and no one visited. again when I have called the support they just told me that the service request is closed and your complaint is resolved.. I have raised complaint again and now this the 10th time in past 6 months I’m raising a complaint for the same issue… let’s s see.. if this’ll not work now the for sure I’ll blow the product on fire somewhere at Onida Showroom…",NEGATIVE
I got 2 tvs of hisense. Both are running perfectly fine. No issues so far. Sound and picture quality is really good. Will not feel cheap at any time. I would highly recommend it.,POSITIVE
"I have bought this TV in the month of September 2024. The screen is bright and clear and so far no issue with the connectivity of the TV. The sound quality is good. For this price, it's a good TV. The installation process was also smooth and the technician was polite and explained well.",POSITIVE
Good tv in budget. Sound is quality is very good. Picture quality is also good and clear.,POSITIVE
"Image quality and sound quality is good, easy to operate",POSITIVE
"At present the screen has several greyish colour spots on the screen. I should have checked it with a simple test : white wallpaper image or white video. I was able to confirm this issue in February-March 2023. I contacted Hisense. Their service team or whoever they have outsourced the service job to is poor. When the TV was under ""manufacturer's warranty"" this greyish issue was not resolved. But after a long time and several attempts this issue which began in February 2023 has finally been resolved in December 2023. Note that it might have been a pre-existing issue but the fact is that I noticed and was able to make sure that it was definitely an issue in February 2023. And again - to be specific - issue has not been resolved but I have been adequately compensated financially by the 3rd party insurance company. As per the service team associated with the insurance company the grey spots repair was not possible due to location, cost prohibitive, etc reasons therefore the insurance company refunded the amount (after deducting the service charges, depreciation, etc). So yes, issue has been resolved in that way which is also okay\good.  The TV screen was packed and delivered with protection using ample plastic lamination. There were 4 different protective lamination in front. There was one big lamination which covered the main screen. Then there were 2 lamination like tapes to hold this main lamination. Then there was one lamination which covered the Hisense brand name panel which is located at the bottom of the screen.  The volume control bar is 100% opaque. It is bright, white and 100% opaque and spoils the view. Moreover, when I try to change volume then this volume bar appears at the middle bottom of the screen. It is not helpful because it completely obscures the subtitles/captions and various other on screen texts/images. This volume bar is TV's system feature or perhaps it is an Android 11 feature. Location of the volume bar should be on the left or right of the screen not bottom. Else, they should have provided an option to change the transparency of the volume bar.  When this TV is about to go to standby it shows a black pop-up in the middle of the screen with the countdown timer. There is no way to cancel or snooze this timer at that moment. So it is not helpful especially if you are watching something important. TV will turn off to standby and you can't do anything about it at that moment.  The location, size, shape, etc of the mute button on the remote is not good at all. Mute button should be of a unique shape. It should be bigger than other buttons and easier to access. Button has been placed in the middle of all buttons which makes it difficult to access it conveniently/ immediately if you are watching something in dark.  I had a Sony LCD TV before. It had an excellent feature of keeping the screen off while audio was still on. It was a very helpful feature. This feature is not available in this TV.  Moreover, the Sony TV had another very useful feature which this TV doesn't have. The display area settings. There were 3 options in the display area settings in the Sony TV viz +1, 0, and -1 which were very helpful. This feature isn't available in this TV.  Options of screensaver timer are few and fixed eg 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc. I wish it was possible to set the screensaver timer of my choice eg 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, etc minutes.  In the Play Store app the installed apps often don't update even after several manual attempts let alone auto update. This is not good.  The OS is Android 11 and still there is no dark mode feature in the TV.  There should be a page up/down feature in the remote. This feature is needed quite often in various apps to browse through various genres, titles, etc. Tapping the up, down, left , right, etc keys repeatedly only to move between titles one by one requires a lot of effort and is a waste of time. It also causes hardware damage because the up, down, left, right, etc keys will wear off quickly and I'll have to buy a new remote soon.  I was focused on so many other features, prices, etc that while making a decision to buy this TV I totally forgot about confirming the energy rating before placing the order. When I placed the order nowhere was it mentioned on Amazon that it has only a 3 star energy rating. I am disappointed with this. I found out that this TV has only a 3 star energy rating after I received the delivery. The energy rating is mentioned on the sticker attached to the protective plastic lamination on the TV screen.  I had a very bad wall mount installation experience with the service company associated with this TV brand but that's a different and a long story and I guess will not be appreciated if I include that in this review.  There are several options in TV Options. One of which is the picture option. In this picture option there is a very helpful option called display mode. This display mode has 6 options. One of which is a 4:3 aspect ratio which is indeed very helpful. But unfortunately there is no option to zoom the video if you have selected this 4:3 aspect ratio. Due to which there are a lot of empty black spaces (black bars) on all 4 sides of the video. These bars or empty spaces are absolutely all right. But I also need to see the 4:3 videos in zoomed in / zoomed out mode sometimes. So an additional setting of zoom in and zoom out ""after"" selecting 4:3 display mode would have been terrific. Wish they had also included a 7th option of cinema aspect ratio ie 2.39:1 in the picture option. There is no aspect ratio above 16:9.  There are 7 modes in picture mode. If you try to change picture mode then there will be a pop-up warning saying ""this option may result in higher energy consumption"". Now amongst these 7 modes there is an ENERGY SAVING mode also. It is surprising that when you try to select this mode the same pop-up warning appears. This is contradictory. How can selecting energy saving mode result in higher energy consumption?  The home screen interface is not easy to use. The selected item or title should be prominent or conspicuous e.g. the selected item should be surrounded by a white / coloured outline so that it is easy to decipher which item is currently under selection. At present the selected item just gets a little bigger which is often difficult to distinguish from other items.  There is no option to download movies, shows, etc in any app unlike mobile phones, tablets, etc. There is no download option at all even in major apps such as Netflix, Amazon prime video, YouTube etc to watch something when offline. This is unexpected and disappointing.  I have a Bluetooth version 4.2 headphones. I could not find the Bluetooth version of the TV mentioned anywhere in the TV. I could not find the Bluetooth version of the tablet mentioned anywhere in the tablet either. The only info available in the tablet is that the Bluetooth AVRCP version is 1.4. The Bluetooth version of the tablet is probably 4.2 as per the information available on the tablet company / brand website. So anyway, I have already paired the headphones with this TV and the tablet. I usually connect headphones either with the tablet or this TV. Now if the headphones are already connected with the tablet and not with TV and then if I disconnect the headphones from the tablet (by switching off the Bluetooth of the tablet) then the headphones should automatically connect with TV. But that doesn't happen. I have to reboot the headphones so that it can automatically connect to TV.  While watching the new The Invisible Man movie (most probably on Netflix app) the visual experience was not good. The movie features a lot of greyish / dark / night scenes. These scenes looked blurry / unclear as if some sort of fog or vapour was floating on the screen. It appears that this TV is not very efficient in displaying true deep darkness in these types of scenes.  Remote often doesn't work efficiently or effectively when casting or screen mirroring e.g. it takes several attempts / pressing the up, down, left right, etc keys of the remote control before the progress bar appears on the TV screen. Progress bar is a basic necessity nowadays so that one could fast forward or fast backward a video.  If I am not mistaken, nowhere on the product page on Amazon or the TV package is mentioned that a wall mount bracket set will be provided. Moreover, there is no mention of the list of all the parts in the wall bracket set pack. There were 8 items in total. Or 1+2+2+2+2+3+3+4=19 individual pieces in total if you count the number of pieces in each item. Or 1+2+2+2+2+3+15+4=31 individual parts in total if you count every part of each piece e.g. each expansive bolt is made up of 5 parts. They should have mentioned this list on the box or on a paper or manual or somewhere appropriate.  I don't know why these brands don't recommend or provide a screen cleaning kit.  You can switch between wall hanging and tabletop mode yourself. You just need to attach the 2 tripod stands using regular screwdrivers. Screws and stands are provided with the TV. But table top stand mode is not satisfactory because it is unstable even on smooth straight surfaces.. TV wobbles when it is on the two tripod stands which- needless to mention - is precarious.  I have paired this TVs Bluetooth with my Moto g04 Android 14 smartphone Bluetooth several times. I wanted to use smartphone as remote control. But this TV keeps disappearing from the phone's Bluetooth list. Hisense support says TV won't pair with phone. Phone support says talk to Hisense.  Conclusion : Not satisfactory. Therefore - overall - after considering everything I rate this TV 2⭐ or 4/10. Since submitting 2.5 STARS is not possible here on Amazon therefore i have no option but to rate it 2 stars. I find it very difficult to rate it 3 stars because to me 3 stars stand for a faultless but good (or average) product (or service).",NEGATIVE
"The product is good built and picture quality is good. 4K videos played nicely. Sound output is also very nice Installation support was good, folks came on time and installed without any issues",POSITIVE
"Good quality TV. Well built and stylish. Good brightness and contrast especially considering the price. No lag noticed while viewing regular TV programs or cricket. Viewing OTT from Amazon prime, Disney etc is a breeze. Android boot up is a bit slow as compared to high end brands like Sony and Samsung but no problems once it is up and running. Best value proposition and having all the features as per latest technology. Excellent picture and sound quality . If you are looking for a premium TV at the very best price, then go for it without a secondary thought  NATWAR SINGH",POSITIVE

"I purchased a Blaupunkt 40 inch TV, a week ago so I share a geniune review. Tv installation done within 24 hours of delivery of tv. I am impressed with its performance in this price range . The picture quality is excellent, with vibrant colors and sharp details that make watching movies and shows a great experience. The sound quality is very good, crisp and clear , bass is also good , no need of any sound bar. Tv has a feature of Google assistant and its work fine. Remote of tv is also classy and easy to use. The smart features of tv work smoothly, Ott apps like Netflix, YouTube, jio tv , prime video and other open without lag and work good without any hassle.  Overall, I am satisfied with this Blaupunkt TV and recommend it to buy anyone who is looking for a good budget-friendly tv.",POSITIVE
"As many of us may think it's a unknown brand, let me clear that those who r having car since 80s or 90s must have used its sound system for their car, so I was well aware of the name. Buying the Blaupunkt tv 55inch was proven a good deal and it has the perfect picture quality and a far better sound quality than other brands not only in this budget range but above price range too. The design, build quality, live colors, smooth and easy operation and of course affordable price makes it a perfect buy TV.",POSITIVE
"We have been using this TV for a appx month now, and it's been an excellent experience. The image quality is outstanding, with vibrant colors and sharp 4K clarity that makes everything look stunning. The Quantum Dot technology really enhances the visuals, especially for HDR content.  The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering rich and immersive audio without needing external speakers. The built-in features and smart interface are smooth and responsive, making navigation and streaming a breeze.  Overall, it's a great value for the price and has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a budget-friendly yet premium TV experience! We will update this review in six moth as we get more experience with its performance..",POSITIVE

"I recently upgraded to the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV, and I’m quite impressed by what it delivers at its price point. Here’s my personal take:  Picture Quality:  The 4K resolution with Dolby Vision really stands out. Watching UHD content is a treat, with vibrant colors and clear details, especially in brighter scenes. However, when streaming SDR content or older shows, you might notice some graininess, especially on larger screens like the 65-inch model. Adjusting the backlight and saturation can help if you prefer more natural tones, as the default settings can be a bit too vivid for my taste.  Sound:  The 30W speakers are surprisingly good for regular TV viewing, supporting Dolby Audio and DTS. For everyday use, they’re loud and clear enough, but I found the bass to be lacking, so if you're a fan of deep, immersive sound, investing in a soundbar might be a good idea.  User Interface:  Google TV is easy to navigate, and I love how it suggests shows and movies across platforms based on my viewing habits. Plus, Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature is a great addition, giving access to over 200 live channels without extra subscriptions. Switching between apps is generally smooth, though I noticed slight lag after prolonged use, but it’s nothing that impacts the overall experience too much.  Design:  The sleek black design with thin bezels looks great in any room. I opted to mount mine on the wall, which I think suits the larger models better as they can take up a lot of space on a stand. It's not a premium build, but it’s sturdy and fits well with modern interiors.  Smoothness In terms of smoothness, the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV is decent but not flawless. The TV is powered by a quad-core A55 chipset, paired with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. For regular tasks like switching between apps, browsing, and streaming, the performance is generally smooth. However, some users have reported occasional lag, especially after prolonged use or when loading heavier apps. It's not a dealbreaker, but the experience might not be as snappy as higher-end models.  The Google TV interface is a big plus here, as it runs efficiently, with intuitive navigation and quick access to content across various platforms. Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature adds to the smoothness, with seamless integration of live TV and streaming apps into one unified experience.  For basic daily use, the smoothness is acceptable, but if you’re after a flawless, zero-lag experience, you might notice occasional slowdowns with heavy multitasking.  Final Thoughts:  Overall, the Xiaomi X Series delivers excellent value for anyone seeking a 4K TV with smart features at an affordable price. Its picture quality shines with UHD content, and the Google TV integration is intuitive. Just be prepared for some occasional performance hiccups and consider adding external speakers if audio quality is a priority for you.",POSITIVE
"Very good and colourful panel, deep blacks, moderate viewing angles. Metal back feels solid. Speaker is also lound and clear. One con is that TV sometimes get slow and ui frames caps to like 30 hz, but it is rare. Hope this issue gets solved by update. Overall if anyone wants fabulous picture quality this should be a very good option. I got the tv at 21750 during sale, so it is value for money product",POSITIVE
"I bought it in August 2024 the packaging was good damage on executive delivered the product at my doorstep and the check the product whether it was damage or not then after 2 hours MI service centre technician called me for installation and they reach to my home within 1 hour and installed the product but I have to pay it extra 500 rupees for the Wall mount because the Wall mount was not including in the box but that is okay because the Wall mount brand is also MI, functionality of the product is good picture quality is good enough features of the product is good but the space of internal storage is not enough(only 8gb,free space is about 4gb)it should be 16GB or more for internal memory, installation was very quick and we are using the TV for last 2 month for me it's a good product I got it from Amazon at rupees of 20700 and extra 500 I paid for the Wall mount so basically it was a good deal but after that the TV was sold in great Indian festival at rupees of 17700 so I missed the opportunity to buy the product at a low price of that never mind, the product connectivity is good, picture quality was very good just go for it",NEGATIVE
As i purchase this Mi A Pro tv because of new launch and affordable price. As i can see some lag in OS as well as playing any 4k content and the internet speed was slow as i connected it through Hotspot...it was taking some time to load even though my internet speed was 300mbps and the delivery guys carelessly kept this Tv flat in their vehicle but tnx there was no damage rather then everything is good worth buying and i hope they fix some bugs in next update Quick Pros* Excellent Picture Quality Excellent Sound Build quality is good Affordable Price Worth buying  Cons* ( which i faced ) Little lag in OS & 4k content Response time is little slow Stand build quality is not good,NEGATIVE
"The worst ever sound quality. Good display but with performance lag! After a week, sound became weaker than it was in the beginning! No more option to replace the TV or replace with another brand!!",NEGATIVE
"Toshiba TVs are known for their exceptional picture quality and impressive performance. The vibrant colors, sharp details, and smooth motion make the viewing experience truly enjoyable.

Giveing review after 1 month of use Pros- Overally video and audio Clearity is awesome. Value for money. Cons- In high moving object like while watching cricket observe when ball moves faster it gets blur some time it's seems 2-3 ball are moves faster back to back like that. In short MEMC not provided or not working properly. But it's not big issue,POSITIVE
"The performance of the Toshiba TV is excellent! The picture quality is vibrant, the sound is crisp, and the overall experience has been great. However, the installation process could have been better. While the setup was completed, one side of the TV is slightly tilted down, which was a bit disappointing.  Despite this minor issue, the TV itself delivers an outstanding viewing experience, and I’m very satisfied with the product. Highly recommend it for its performance!",POSITIVE
"The TV is awsome, very nice picture quality and dolby atmos is too good. At this price point you can't ask for more. Yes in comparison to all Android tv this is a bit slow but faster than the rest.  Important part- I read many negative comments or reviews regarding installation failure. The same happened with me, however with constant communication with Amazon they helped me to get the tv installed within the scheduled time. Yes if you are polite enough anyone will help you out.  There are reviews regarding the tv shutting down itself after some time. The same thing happened with me. But it's a energy saving feature of the TV, if you keep it in idle condition it will shutdown. That is a good feature. But illeterate consumers doesn't understand nor study the manual before posting such reviews. It's an awsome tv go for it",NEGATIVE
"TV is a good buy at this price point. Picture quality could have been better, sound is clear and loud. Overall a nice tv.",POSITIVE
"Positives: overall good performance, 2 years of warranty.  Negatives: White light bleeding at the edges of screen very clearly visible in grey screen.",NEGATIVE

"* Amazon delivered early morning * Installation done on the same day, knowledgeable service person * Review based on 2 months usage  Why I chose Panasonic? Nothing special, I still have my 13yr old 32 inch Panasonic TV running fine. So I wanted to buy same brand once again :D  PROs * Nice picture and sound quality. I upgraded from a older Panasonic 720p TV, so * OS is faster most of the times. I don't see much of a difference compared to the basic firestick. * Nice smart Remote with minimal keys * The wall mount coming with the TV is enough this TV. But it is recommended to buy a generic mount if there are any plans to upgrade in near future. * Connecting to WIFI and Bluetooth devices works fine.  CONs * OS lags some times when multiple apps are opened. So this is purely based on usage. * TV audio is ok but recommend to have a soundbar or something  Haven't tested ethernet connectivity, will update once done  Note : Recommended to get an external stabilizer",NEGATIVE
"The speed of processor is very slow. The remote goes stuck every few seconds..cant watch TV peacefully... It's like being using old age phone in this era.... The memory of the TV was written 16 gb in description but the memory is only 8gb total... It's showing 7.8 gb total... Available after apps of TV (in built) is 4.8 GB... I was expecting atleast that you don't lie AMAZON. Overall, I'm not happy what I got... Only good part is screen... It's good",NEGATIVE
Picture quality is excellent. As a basic TV it's easy to use. Overall a great TV.,POSITIVE
"Superb quality and excellent features  My Samsung Frame TV (Matt Finish)  The first thing I like is to have our customizable Photos / Paintings as a Frame and It looks like a real.  The picture quality is far better than I expected and is fully customizable to suit your room, even though it can adjust itself automatically depending on the darkness of the room, time of day etc.  The sound quality through the TV is excellent but I opted to add the Samsung Sound Bar with sourrended speakers for some really immersive viewing.  The one thing that I really like is that there’s just 1 thin cable from the TV, which plugs into the hub.  Features again are superb and there are loads of options to set up your TV exactly as you want it.  Finally, value for money? Yes most definitely in my opinion. I have an excellent TV, with the features, quality, and price I wanted, which I think is definitely value for money for a quality product like this.",POSITIVE
Qlty good sound qlty good eassy we installed it happy to buy. Picture qlty good 4k qlty good. As per price vallue good,POSITIVE
"This 2024 4k qled may be slightly better than a regular 4k LED tv.  Picture quality is good. Colour reproduction is uniform and consistent. But audio is cheap, Dolby audio is good but you would need to connect a soundbar.  HDR performance is good. Not great due to average brightness of the panel, peaks around 450nits.  No VRR. Watching Sports is normal like a regular 50Hz TV. For smoother sports action might consider different TV with120Hz or higher refresh rate.  Screen is reflective, so need to take some measures for direct light glares. Design is slim and looks premium. Minimal bezel. Build quality is good.  Accessibility of the port will be a major issue if you are planning to wall mount. Purchase a movable telescopic wall mount, some extra cost for ease of access and cleaning. Installation was within 24 hours. Remote is the highlight. Tiny and handy.  Tizen OS is light but not so snappy. App store is not so great, but you get most of the popular OTT. Could not locate samsung game hub support in this.  Edit: Sometimes I noticed clouding in non-HDR dark scenes. It may be due to edgelit LED in this tv, which cannot produce local dimming as you could get in a backlit panel.",NEGATIVE
"This is a review almost after one year of using the product. Great picture quality. But after the software update in October, the software has become really buggy and a hassle to use the TV. Everytime I switch on the TV, the brightness becomes completely low. The universal remote is so buggy that everytime I switch on the TV, the set top box would switch off. Now I have turned off the universal remote feature and that’s not happening. But the technicians are not able to understand that. Have communicated multiple times that these two issues have come up after the software update but they don’t even listen to me. Tired of changing the brightness setting every single time I turn on the TV. Been waiting for a software update since October 2023 but that is also not happening. Wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy this product and go through this effort. Not worth it.",NEGATIVE
I have been using this tv for almost a year now and I can certainly say that it one of the best smart tvs available in the market. I was sceptical initially about the picture quality comparing the other tv available in the market. But after using it for this long I am very happy with the picture quality. Built in speakers a way better than the other tvs in this range. It gives proper thump and crisp sound. At last talking about the best feature which is being a frame tv it looks super cool and whenever someone is coming to your house they are definitely going to talk about the tv. It stands out from the rest.,POSITIVE
"I am writing this review after using for 3 days.  I have watched - Movie and IND vs AUS live match in OTT apps: Video and audio quality is too good. - Watched latest video songs on YouTube app: Video quality and audio quality is too good. - Watched SD channel in DTH: SD channel is handled perfectly. I don't see any blur nees and video quality loss. Don't see colors banding, Video sharpness is also perfectly handled. - Watched HD channels in DTH: No need say. Quality is too good. - Watched 4K content from YouTube: Quality is too good.  Pleasure watching my all time favorite movie THOLIPREMA (1998) in this TV. Amazed with video quality, image sharpness and audio quality considering old movie.  Design: - Almost Baseless TV - Thin TV. Just like a frame. - Simple remote. But all controls has it. - Can charge remote with Solar and USB type C.  Delivery and installation: - Received TV in 1 day. - Installation done on next day.  Features: - Connected to smart things app. - From app, we can control TV with virtual remote. - TV turn on/ off also controlled with app.  I thought of buying Samsung Frame 2022 55 inches TV. But in offer sales I didn't get better deal.  I am happy with Samsung QLED 2023 55 inch TV. I strongly recommend this TV.",POSITIVE
"Cons: 1)It's expensive. 2)You have to buy a frame/bezel separately(3k-9k) 3)One Connect Box has to be stored or hidden somewhere & buy accessories to attach other devices 4)Software, yes it laggs (do proper switch off/on & it will be fine)  Is it worth buying? YES, DEFINITELY. 1) ART, ART & ART 2) Matte screen: Anti-glare, low gloss finish that handles reflections well ( IN DAY LIGHT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN A REALLY ART) 3) Picture quality & Design 4) Practical remote(no cells required, you have to charge it)",NEGATIVE

Overall, it's a great value for the price and has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a budget-friendly yet premium TV experience! We will update this review in six moth as we get more experience with its performance..",POSITIVE
"I am Giving my impression after using this TV for 5 months. This is a good Qled TV at this price point, with good picture quality and excellent sound.",POSITIVE

This is one of the best budget qled tv under 30k Picture quality is quite decent and good enough Sound quality is better and louder than other competitors. Working Seamlessly since last 6 months Con: Aux Audio output is Unavailable,POSITIVE
"This one is hands down best combo of firetv stick and Indian made TV. This is 2020 version (H1F1), which has 20W sound instead of old 16W sound. Picture quality is great, sound is nice. Best part, apps and firetv stick responds so quick that my old Sony smart-tv looks lost in league. First time updates and everything will take time but is easy. Remote is much better than Alexa and Mi. Also supports voice command and screen off while listening music. Tons of apps and regular firmware update. In the end, in this small city ... Onida customer care called, fixed a technician appointment and then tech came. He checked the TV for damages and wrote down the warranty card with direct call number. Chinese... Brands... Go back from India. We have a contender now.",POSITIVE
"I ordered Onida 32 inch after going through several other options available (Mi. etc) Initially, it look some time due to updates, and once done, it started working smoothly. Sound quality is fine (considering 15k price range), Picture quality is nice. This TV 'Fire TV OS', which I found only little bit lag, but manageable. Overall I can say - under 15k, this is a smart and good choice.",POSITIVE
Tv is good but remote quality is not good,NEGATIVE
With in 3 days of usgae the TV stopped working...now no power..not worth buying.,NEGATIVE
Video picture quality best lowest price best TV,NEGATIVE
"*1 day review*  Amazon delivered the product within 24 hrs. Person from ONIDA came for installation within 48 hrs as they promised. Completely satisfy with picture and sound quality. (My previous TV was 20yrs old box type tv, so i dont know picture quality of other LED or LCD tv.) Connectivity is also good. No buffering on wifi, mobile casting works fine and faced no issues while using USB pendrives.  I will also upload 6 months review.",POSITIVE
This tv is value for money. It responds really fast to the remote. The picture and sound quality are really nice. You Dont need a sound bar with it. And no such problem of internet connection getting lost. It works so smooth once connected. Overall a very nice tv to buy. I am happy that I bought it after going through all the options. A thumbs up from me.,POSITIVE
"I have bought new TV in December 2020. I am continuously facing the issue of ""Power Drain"" in my New Remote. I realized this problem a month of use after my purchase. I immediately made a complaint to Onida for replacement. It's almost 5 months, I haven't received any replacement from the company. Every time I am following with them to know about replacement and they are ensuring I will receive new remote but not giving any timeline. It's really a painful experience in the after sale service with Onida. Have a second thought about After Sale Service before buying Onida Products. Also Sound fluctuation issue (sometimes suddenly sound ups and down) and voice recognition issue with remote, was raised service request with in warranty period. Service guys (2 members) visited my place, and upgraded software and checked remote, reset the remote. and as they have suggested batteries draining issue will check after 2 days observation. Later no update and no one visited. again when I have called the support they just told me that the service request is closed and your complaint is resolved.. I have raised complaint again and now this the 10th time in past 6 months I’m raising a complaint for the same issue… let’s s see.. if this’ll not work now the for sure I’ll blow the product on fire somewhere at Onida Showroom…",NEGATIVE
"Value For Money, Picture Clarity & Sound Quality Is Really Really Awesome Really I Liked This Product Quality Of Product is No.1 Installation Is Also Very Simple Size & Design Altimate.",POSITIVE
"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE
Samsung products are good. Installation service is also good. Performance and display quality is very best. Really value for money. I bought this with the brand name.,POSITIVE
"Overall a value product (75 inch) with very good quality. Happy with the sound and screen brightness. Design could have been sleeker, yet Google TV makes it worth it",POSITIVE
Writing this review after 15 days of use I got the 55inch C61b for rs 31739 effective without no cost emi discount. For that price its a steal deal!! Pros: Sound - the 35w onkyo speaker system on this tv is beast. You won’t need a soundbar if your room is below 150 sqft. The bass is good. The sound clarity is superb. No distortion even in higher volumes. Best speaker system that I have seen in a tv. Picture- its a VA qled panel The picture quality is very good Blacks are deep Colours are punchy No complaints with picture fully satisfied The google tv os is very responsive with minor lags only after booting which goes away after sometimes. Dolby vision HDR HLG HDR10+ supports are there You need to adjust few settings to avoid motion smoothening issue Gaming mode is also there  Cons The con I felt is the little backlight bleeding on edges which you won’t notice normally But visible in grey screens not in black So not a big issue Installation is very late I got call after 8th day for installation  Overall this is the best tv you can buy under 40k Go for 55 inch or above the onkyo sound is superb Will definitely recommend,POSITIVE
TCL is very good picture quality with affordable price for this QLED TV and very nice audio experience. This TV is equal of samsung and sony and LG TV picture quality.  Worth product,POSITIVE
"Its a review of the 55 inch tv!!! PROS: 1. Design: With minimum bezels, its an updated design, feels premium by the sleek edges. 2. Display: The TV supports DOLBY vision, 4k with QLED. If you are upgrading from an HD tv, you are going to be blown away by the colour output it generates. The colour contrast with deep blacks is quite amazing. I personally haven't tried game mode so cannot comment. I have tried connecting my gaming laptop in HDMI, played FC24, it feels good by the amazing 55 inches display. The tv is quite bright even in sunny daylight. Viewing angle is also good. 3. Sound: The TV comes with a 20W speaker in the back, has a good bass and is quite loud. If you are music enthusiast, you won't be impressed. Its loud and clear and satisfactory when compared to other tv's in the market. No distortion even at 100% volume. 4. Connectivity: Wifi connectivity is good. I use my 5G phone for internet connection with unlimited pack. No lagging issues at all and its a GOOGLE TV so you get maximum app support. CONS: 1. Display: If you are a sports lover, you would be disappointed. The tv has jittering issues and motion clarity isn't good when it comes to sports. High action scenes with fast movement is where the tv lags. When watching cricket, the motion clarity isn't good enough. FINAL VERDICT: I bought this 55 inch tv for 34k. In this price point, you surely won't be disappointed at all. Its the best OLED TV you can find in the market. Trust me, even SAMSUNG, LG and SONY fails when compared with price. I personally visited Relaince Digital before buying the TV online. I compared all the TV's and bought this after thorough research. Buy this tv and you wouldn't regret at all. The only CON isn't a deal breaker at all. I love watching cricket and its ok with the jittering. I am pretty satisfied with the overall experience. I recommend buying the 4k pack of OTT's like Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime. You would love the overall viewing experience of watching movies and series in this huge display.",POSITIVE
I rarely give a 5 star .. It got amazing picture quality and decent soundd quality... The tv runs pretty fast and the blacks are so deep... Good upscaling... Best under 40k for 43inches tv,POSITIVE
Product is good but installation guys were in hurry..as they are service provider also hence not raised any complaint..,NEGATIVE
After using 3 weeks i must say I chosen the best 4K TV with the price best sound best picture quality best configuration best product best 4K best colours on the TV,POSITIVE
"I bought this TV for watching in my home. I like the build and the sleek design. One Important matter I want to bring to your notice is that communication within Amazon to its customers are leaking out....... After delivery, I was informed by Amazon that the technician will come the next day (Sunday) who didn't turn up. After that, I got another intimation from Amazon stating that a new technician will come the NEXT day for installation. He did. However, in between I got an anonymous call from UK stating that they are calling from Amazon and informed me of the technician's visit and asked me to confirm by pressing 1 or 9 to cancel.....!!!! I ignored the call. This is just for your information to take up matter within so as to plug any loophole in your communication leakage.",NEGATIVE
"I haven't used an android/google TV before. If you're already a heavy youtube user, the TV is for you. The picture quality is great despite its price, it delivers great value for your money. This TV is a price - performance monster, I can honestly say.",POSITIVE
"TV was okay initially but started running slowly after a couple months. The menu scrolling lags so much and TV restarts evertime I start apps like netflix. I have kept the software up to date and done all sorts of trouble shooting with no fix. Picture and sound quality are excellent but TV is so laggy and unpredictable. I would have returned it, but window is closed.",NEGATIVE
"Our old LG tv was past it's best and with strong sunlight the picture was very dark. We looked at TCL and Hisense in Currys but they didn't really seem interested in selling us one and were trying to push expensive Samsung's onto us. We didn't want to spend that much so retired to Costa for a coffee. Whilst there I looked on Amazon and noticed the price of the 50"" TCL had dropped to £299 so went for it, the Currys price was £374 at the time.  So far it has been very good with excellent picture quality, however this is an Android tv and setting it up was a pain with not much help from the manual. Altogether it took two days messing around to get a decent setup! Android is a mobile phone operating system owned by Google, so they really push you to either log in to your Google account or set one up. I'm not the greatest fan of Google because it wants to know too much of your business but there are a few videos on YouTube (also owned by Google!) about setting it up as a standalone. On all my old tv's you scan for channels and it works, not any more so beware.  Once I'd scanned all the channels in (nearly 1000!) the picture went to a ""Home screen"" and I hadn't got a clue what to do next. Eventually by a matter of trial and error and just pushing buttons on the remote I got onto a channel list and got Freeview to work, please note there is no built in Freesat on this as there was on our old LG. The channels were all over the place with BBC at about channel 45. Lots of channels didn't work with a message saying some dongle or other wasn't installed and to be honest I was not very impressed at the end of day 1.  On day 2 I decided to re-scan the channels and noticed a few options so opted for ""Free only"". This made a big difference and the ""dongle"" channels had disappeared. The channels were all still mixed up and then I noticed the channel list was in alphabetical order, so ITV was way down the list. This was getting more and more frustrating by the minute until I found a channel organizer in the settings. This brings up the channel list again but using the remote it's possible to click on a channel which brings an option box up. One of the options is ""Move"", by clicking on this option then clicking on another channel number the first channel moves to the new position. So I was able to move BBC1 to channel 1 and then spent the next few hours moving dozens of other channels as well. There is a ""Favourites"" option but I still haven't worked that one out yet.  Is it a good tv? I would say yes but be prepared for a lot of faffing about unless you are a wizz kid geek. I still haven't worked it all out but have got it so it's watchable but even now after a few weeks I still get confused by it, mainly trying to get from the home screen onto normal channels.",NEGATIVE
Superb value great picture quality easy set up migration,POSITIVE
"I received the TV brand new, after i removed the tape, i saw that there are two huge dots where the pixels are dead.",NEGATIVE
"I was in search of an affordable Android television for secondary usage and I was crawling through Amazon when I saw this VW smart television perfectly fitting in my budget I went through the reviews and found most of the reviews on the positive side and I ordered the product I was surprise to see such picture quality and sound quality in this price range + the software experience is also top notch as it's supports Play wall and YouTube without ads, lag free user interface, what else one can ask for, go for it without second thought.",POSITIVE
"If you're contemplating buying this for its price point, please don't. This useless piece of trash is not even worth 100 rs. If anything, VW should pay us to take this TV.  Bought one. Most of the apps weren't working in the initial stage. Tried to get a refund, but Amazon stipulates that only replacement is possible, that too after a technician visit. The support for VW is so bad they just refused to come.  Amazon agreed for a replacement after 6-7 days and we got a replacement. Please note that for apps like Netflix, you need to use a mouse button which will give you a good nostalgia of 15 year technology. When the replacement TV somehow was panting through its existence, after a good 7-8 days, the mouse pointer stopped working and the TV started showing the message: please uninstall apps as the storage space is low.  We got connected to the customer care center with a lot of trouble, and their solution is to do a factory reset. A WEEK AFTER THE TV WAS BOUGHT.  If you don't want to torture yourself please don't buy this useless piece of trash. I have already wasted 5-6 hours of my life trying to get this antique piece to a running mode and fully expect for it to crash in another week again. Amazon refuses to take the product back, and the technician support is next to useless. This is definitely your money down the drain and if you try for a refund, Amazon will ensure that you regret your existence by making you jump through impossible hoops like a circus monkey.",NEGATIVE
Works well. The remote has not full featured. No proper authorised service centers.,NEGATIVE
"Unmatchable experience at this price range….. No need to invest your hard earned money for the brands who will never give you any returns all those brands will give you the similar visuals which VW is offering and prices will be at least double than this…. I’m writing this review after one month of usage…. I liked the product very much and I have recently purchased the 40 inches model and gifted to my aunty! Unfortunately the remote wasn’t working but here I want to specify about the excellent after sale service of both Amazon and VW…. Amazon took immediate actions to replace the whole TV unit just because of the remote but due to my request that I just want remote to be replaced not the whole TV unit, they forwarded my request to VW and they contacted me today and they’ve already sent the remote to my aunt’s address! Fantastic customer handling and Fantastic product….. Go for it folks!!!!!",POSITIVE
Value for money,POSITIVE
"I bought 32inch tv for my parents not more than 7 months display gone i call one customer care number they simply ask me to send the details by whatsapp and cut off the call, later i send the details by whatsapp after 4 days one service person came check the Tv and he said Display problem have to change display it will take around 10 days but more two weeks no response from service person i call that service person he reply irresponsible we didn't get the spare from Brand if you want urgent you can contact brand but there is no way to contact Brand please don't buy this product any more Tv is ok until work but have any issues no proper person to contact there is no customer support mail id no propper office no proper comunications",NEGATIVE
Good,POSITIVE
"The television seems to offer excellent value for its price, boasting impressive display and sound quality. The 2.4GHz connectivity is reliable, with no network issues reported, which is a significant plus. For those with a budget under 15,000, this TV could be a strong contender, particularly for consumers prioritizing display quality. Even at a low volume setting, the audio quality remains satisfactory, enhancing the overall experience. Such positive feedback suggests this product is highly recommendable.",POSITIVE
"I must say, you will get what you pay......  It's a decent tv, but not my type and the reason for saying this.. I already have couple of high end tv's including a 65 inch Sony Android Tv, a Samsung 3D TV.  While going through the deals, found this and I must say it was a damn good deal 18K only for 40 inch Panasonic.....you can only get local Chinese brand for this price. As review was also good, so bought this for guest room.  Delivery was pathetic... Sent via Delivery... and instead of reaching to the nearest delivery station, it keeps lying in their warehouse for 3~4 days, as those guys don't have a van/tempo to deliver this (and that's in NCR region).... Even they called me and asked... ""Sir motorcycle par bandh lau kya as gadi nahi hai"".. If I allow them to tied up it on their motorcycle and deliver it..., I said no to them, so finally on last delivery date it got delivered.  Installation was quick just in 30 mins of delivery and guy was very polite and decent.  Now starting with TV, picture quality is quite crisp n clear... Not like Sony but decent in the given price after all its 10 times difference in the price.  Bad part is the viewing angle, which is worse  Sound is quite loud.... Louder then Sony or Samsung, but missed the clarity... But that's not a challenge for me as I connected a Bluetooth Speaker.  Pros: Crisp N clear picture A+ Panel Louder sound Good customer service Japanese technology and that's visible in the built Latest Android for TV and hope to get update as well as it's a latest launch frm Panasonic 2020 model. Supports App installation and Update Tried Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar... Working fine. Much much better then MI.... (my friend bought an MI and believe me it's worse)  Cons: Very bad viewing angle, picture looks crisp n clear when you are sitting in front, but if you are viewing from side it's blurry n greenish will share image...... Not sure but seems it's have a viewing angle of 60 to 80° degree only.... Even my VU have better viewing angle if 178°  It doesn't support 5Ghz wifi and it means you need to connect it with a 2.4Ghz wifi router.. Means less speed and might impact watching online content... Although in my case I don't face any such issue, but then I have 100Mbps connection and even on 2.4 ghz it's somewhere 60Mbps +  Sound is loud, but not clear... Better to use some good quality home theater.  Low RAM size.  So overall it's a good set and worth the price, you can go for it if it's your first smart TV, just keep in mind on viewing angle.  If you already using high-end tv I suggest not to go with this, better to go with high end tv's only or even VU is better.......  As per me the only bad part is it's viewing angle.. Rest all manageable and ok for the given price.",NEGATIVE
Very Good picture quality and Sound quality. I recommend everyone to buy this product. Timely installation by technician,POSITIVE
It's really a value for money product...Good picture quality and sound quality. Panasonic is one of the leading Japanese electronics brand so that was one of the main reason went ahead with the purchase and definitely satisfied.,POSITIVE
Not worthy a penny....manufacture year not mentioned....getting screen issues again n again....defected product....even not replacing the item saying it's a physical damage...but it's not...not advised to purchase this brand.,NEGATIVE
The tv is good I thought I will have to purchase an extra speeker but surprisingly the quality of the speaker is too good and the display quality is also good,POSITIVE

Very good,POSITIVE
"Great features and support for best price. Best Best Best. Westinghouse is offering budget-friendly electronics, including TVs. They’re not as well-known as some other brands like Samsung or LG, but they still provide a very good value. The 40-inch screen is a decent size for medium to small rooms. It’s good for general TV watching, gaming, and streaming. It is a perfect Smart TV with built-in streaming apps and internet connectivity. It supports the apps and services I use frequently. Voice Response feature is great for hands-free control. It’s useful who prefer voice commands over navigating menus with a remote. Comes with a dual 30-watt speaker setup is relatively powerful for a TV of this size. It provided clear and decent sound quality and enhanced audio. It has an excellent picture quality, for the price range. A professional installation crew was a great plus. They ensured that the TV is set up correctly and optimized its placement. It’s the lowest cost available, without compromising on critical features.  Additional Merits: Warranty and Support: They have given 2 years of warranty Connectivity: Has enough HDMI ports, USB ports, and other connections for your devices. Everything aligns with my needs and the price is right, it is an excellent choice i would suggest for anybody looking for best priced TV without compromising the features.",POSITIVE
"1. **""Great Value for the Price""**: ""I bought this Westinghouse TV a few weeks ago, and I'm thrilled with it. The picture quality is sharp, and the colors are vibrant.

The display is clear and bright, and the sound is more than adequate. It's been a solid performer and a great purchase.""",POSITIVE
"Reviewing after 2 months. It's nice TV under this price. Picture quality and especially sound quality is awesome. Only issue with the display panel. Dark scenes are bit ghosty which doesn't look great, probably it's not an IPS panel. Otherwise picture quality is good. I have deducted one star due to this only.  Pros: clear and crisp sound, enough bass. You won't get boom kind of bass but it's good enough considering an LCD TV.  Power consumption is under 50 watt. I have checked it through a smart switch device however in the description it's mentioned as 150 watt which is not right.  After adjusting equaliser and sound settings, you will get good theatre like sound. Don't turn on surround sound.  Remote works well.  Includes wall mount kit which saves some money for you.  Free of cost installation.  Cons: User interface is bit laggy probably because of 1GB RAM only but it's still much better than Amazon Fire Stick.  Ghosty image in dark background scenes. Could have used IPS panel and increased the price it more, however it's still a good deal.  Adding a ghosty image for your understanding.  It's my advice to add three years insurance for complete piece of mind.",POSITIVE
"I received a faulty product. It got delivered on 16th Dec. I started using the same day. On first look the panel looked cheap and the picture quality fell flat. Sound quality was fine. Since I paid 15.5K I didn’t mind. As I understood I am going to get a mediocre product.  The trouble started the same day. At first the screen was jittering from time to time. Then the display turned off while the sound was running. Then the TV started turning off every 5 mins. Now the display is completely off.  I called Amazon on 17th before the installation person arrived and I complained about this. The Amazon customer care mentioned the tech will reach out in 48 hours to resolve this. No one called. Today is the 20th, the TV doesn’t turn on any more. Apparently I might be eligible for only a replacement.  I want to understand the Amazon policy. If a customer got a faulty product, also the customer isn’t happy with the product, also the tech team is a no show and the customer isn’t happy with the service of the brand either doesn’t that qualify for a return? If not what else does?  I can’t believe I have to wait for over 5 days and multiple calls and video evidence collected. Still I can’t get a product return. I have used amazon US for 10 years. It’s fair to say there are double standards compared to India. And Indian customers aren’t treated fairly. Hope Amazon India reconsiders its stupid return policy.",NEGATIVE

"I bought it for 16k. Sound and screen were good i won't say superb but ok if u want buy good tv in budget. Pros- Screen clarity is ok Sound is good Design is super All apps: netflix,prime, Hotstar etc all are running without any issues Supports dual band wifi(u can take blindly for this option).  Cons- little lag This tv support only 1080p in youtube or anywhere i won't go above 1080p. So if u want full clarity of screen this is not for you but if u can adjust a little this TV is wonderful.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased a Toshiba TV, and I am thoroughly impressed. The picture clarity is outstanding, making every movie and show a visual treat. The colors are vibrant, and the details are sharp, even in fast-paced scenes. The sound quality is equally impressive, providing an immersive experience.  Setup was quick and easy, and the interface is user-friendly. With a sleek design and great features, this TV offers incredible value for its price. If you're looking for a reliable, high-quality television without breaking the bank, this is a must-buy. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE

"I recently upgraded to the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV, and I’m quite impressed by what it delivers at its price point. Here’s my personal take:  Picture Quality:  The 4K resolution with Dolby Vision really stands out. Watching UHD content is a treat, with vibrant colors and clear details, especially in brighter scenes. However, when streaming SDR content or older shows, you might notice some graininess, especially on larger screens like the 65-inch model. Adjusting the backlight and saturation can help if you prefer more natural tones, as the default settings can be a bit too vivid for my taste.  Sound:  The 30W speakers are surprisingly good for regular TV viewing, supporting Dolby Audio and DTS. For everyday use, they’re loud and clear enough, but I found the bass to be lacking, so if you're a fan of deep, immersive sound, investing in a soundbar might be a good idea.  User Interface:  Google TV is easy to navigate, and I love how it suggests shows and movies across platforms based on my viewing habits. Plus, Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature is a great addition, giving access to over 200 live channels without extra subscriptions. Switching between apps is generally smooth, though I noticed slight lag after prolonged use, but it’s nothing that impacts the overall experience too much.  Design:  The sleek black design with thin bezels looks great in any room. I opted to mount mine on the wall, which I think suits the larger models better as they can take up a lot of space on a stand. It's not a premium build, but it’s sturdy and fits well with modern interiors.  Smoothness In terms of smoothness, the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV is decent but not flawless. The TV is powered by a quad-core A55 chipset, paired with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. For regular tasks like switching between apps, browsing, and streaming, the performance is generally smooth. However, some users have reported occasional lag, especially after prolonged use or when loading heavier apps. It's not a dealbreaker, but the experience might not be as snappy as higher-end models.  The Google TV interface is a big plus here, as it runs efficiently, with intuitive navigation and quick access to content across various platforms. Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature adds to the smoothness, with seamless integration of live TV and streaming apps into one unified experience.  For basic daily use, the smoothness is acceptable, but if you’re after a flawless, zero-lag experience, you might notice occasional slowdowns with heavy multitasking.  Final Thoughts:  Overall, the Xiaomi X Series delivers excellent value for anyone seeking a 4K TV with smart features at an affordable price. Its picture quality shines with UHD content, and the Google TV integration is intuitive. Just be prepared for some occasional performance hiccups and consider adding external speakers if audio quality is a priority for you.",POSITIVE
"Very good and colourful panel, deep blacks, moderate viewing angles. Metal back feels solid. Speaker is also lound and clear. One con is that TV sometimes get slow and ui frames caps to like 30 hz, but it is rare. Hope this issue gets solved by update. Overall if anyone wants fabulous picture quality this should be a very good option. I got the tv at 21750 during sale, so it is value for money product",POSITIVE
"I bought it in August 2024 the packaging was good damage on executive delivered the product at my doorstep and the check the product whether it was damage or not then after 2 hours MI service centre technician called me for installation and they reach to my home within 1 hour and installed the product but I have to pay it extra 500 rupees for the Wall mount because the Wall mount was not including in the box but that is okay because the Wall mount brand is also MI, functionality of the product is good picture quality is good enough features of the product is good but the space of internal storage is not enough(only 8gb,free space is about 4gb)it should be 16GB or more for internal memory, installation was very quick and we are using the TV for last 2 month for me it's a good product I got it from Amazon at rupees of 20700 and extra 500 I paid for the Wall mount so basically it was a good deal but after that the TV was sold in great Indian festival at rupees of 17700 so I missed the opportunity to buy the product at a low price of that never mind, the product connectivity is good, picture quality was very good just go for it",NEGATIVE
As i purchase this Mi A Pro tv because of new launch and affordable price. As i can see some lag in OS as well as playing any 4k content and the internet speed was slow as i connected it through Hotspot...it was taking some time to load even though my internet speed was 300mbps and the delivery guys carelessly kept this Tv flat in their vehicle but tnx there was no damage rather then everything is good worth buying and i hope they fix some bugs in next update Quick Pros* Excellent Picture Quality Excellent Sound Build quality is good Affordable Price Worth buying  Cons* ( which i faced ) Little lag in OS & 4k content Response time is little slow Stand build quality is not good,NEGATIVE
"The worst ever sound quality. Good display but with performance lag! After a week, sound became weaker than it was in the beginning! No more option to replace the TV or replace with another brand!!",NEGATIVE
I have been using the TV for a month or so. I am fully satisfied with the picture and sound quality. Installation was done by the company personal on the next day (best service). Build quality is good. I am having various apps installed from Google Play Store. I am very happy with my decision to purchase this TV.,POSITIVE
"So it displays colours excellently, sometimes you might find the HDR making a scene a little dark, but it's a nitpick. The audio on the other hand is a mixed bag, the vocals are not that pronounced so you might face problems while listening to podcasts/interviews and even dialogues in the movies (but that's on rare occasions). Apart from this, the TV is value for money. Go for it.",NEGATIVE
This product is a nice product. The look is very good. Picture quality is awesome. Volume quality is good. Little slow and wi-fi functions is little-bit hazardous. The technician who install the product for me is technically sound and co-operative.. I must say this is good cost-effective product to buy.,POSITIVE
We have requested to replace our product because sound of the TV was not working. Amazon has accepted our request but don't replaced the product. Don't buy this product from Amazon.,NEGATIVE
You will get 5 different sound quality and 9 different picture quality in this Product. You will find the difference one to another,POSITIVE
At this price it a nice product value for money and quality is excellent..,POSITIVE
"Quality of screen is good,sound is good till the 3 months of usage... but it has bit lag in remote to TV..... not suitable for elders in home, useful as cctv monitor and secondary screen for computer... not suits for TV in home..... but for a shorter term like 8 months pretty good after 4 months we experience full lag.",NEGATIVE
"I bought a Kodak TV, which was well within my budget and I needed this TV for very minimalistic usage. nonetheless, it has exceeded my expectations regarding functionality and picture quality. I generally don't write reviews but this TV's performance compelled me to write it. So if anyone is planning to buy any TV of the most sold brand this is comfortably competing with them and way ahead in terms of value for money and smooth remote function. I will go for it again if needed. Feature and remote buttons are very user-friendly.",POSITIVE
"Built quality is decent but at this price point features is great, a bluetooth remote, Sound quality, easy to use, sometimes it run slow. You can also install 3rd party apps. And I purchased @7999",POSITIVE
"I purchased a Kodak TV on January 9th, 2025, but unfortunately, it stopped working within 10 days. The screen went blank, and despite numerous attempts, I couldn't get a proper response from Kodak's customer service.  It's been over 10 days, and no action has been taken to resolve the issue. To make matters worse, calling the customer care number is a frustrating experience, with wait times exceeding 30 minutes.  I would advise potential buyers to think twice before purchasing a Kodak TV due to their poor after-sales service.",NEGATIVE
"The sound quality is good. I didn't experience any installation issue. They called, came and installed all the components. The screen is not that best but keeping in mind of the budget the screen is decent without any complaint. Overall, first experience, the TV is looking good. I have to see and wait for few days if any issues is coming or not.",POSITIVE

Setup was a breeze, thanks to the intuitive interface and straightforward instructions. The sound quality is surprisingly good, filling the room with clear audio. I appreciate the variety of connectivity options available, including HDMI and USB ports, which make it easy to connect all my devices. Overall, this TV offers incredible value for its price, combining excellent performance with affordability. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"At the time of purchase, my requirement was just for a 32-inch LED TV that supports HDMI connection because I needed to put this in Guard room so that he can watch the camera recordings. When I bought this product, I got it for a very reasonable price and that too with the functions it support. It has built-in android so that we can download all the OTT apps for our entertainment. I didn't buy it for those functions but having them in this price is nice. Also, I thought that these features are just for marketing and we will not get the quality and apps would hang, but, I was wrong, they work fine and the display quality is also very good. I am satisfied with this product, and it fulfils all my requirements.  P.S.: I didn't connect Wi-fi on this TV, or else the guard would wind up watching youtube for the whole day😅😅.",POSITIVE
"JVC TV Review – Great Value for Money!  I recently got a JVC TV, and it’s been a fantastic purchase! The picture quality is sharp and vibrant, making movies and games look great.

Picture and sound quality is very good.,POSITIVE
"The TV's picture quality is far below expectations, failing to meet even basic HD standards despite being marketed as QLED. The remote’s voice command and Google Assistant are non-functional, and it lacks a mute button. Despite repeated complaints, no technician has visited, and no complaint number was provided, showing a lack of transparency and accountability.",NEGATIVE
"Very good product compared to many other brands. Good sound output. 👍Good 50"" display.",POSITIVE
"Feel good and satisfied about my purchase of JVC brand QLED TV at reasonable price, Amazon's safe and prompt delivery and after-service. The picture quality is phenomenal and I really enjoyed this purchase through Amazon. I strongly recommend this brand of TV to anyone who planned to buy a TV without any hesitation.",POSITIVE
JCV 40 Inch TV is very good picture quality and sound system is also very good.,POSITIVE
"Today i purchased the 50-inch Wooble QLED TV, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The picture quality is simply stunning—sharp, vibrant colors and deep contrasts make watching movies or shows a truly immersive experience. Whether it's HD or 4K content, the visuals are crisp and crystal clear, doing full justice to the QLED technology.  The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering rich, full-bodied audio that complements the visual experience. I didn't need any external speakers as the in-built sound system offers a well-balanced range of highs and lows, making it perfect for everything from action-packed films to quiet dialogues.  The design of the TV is another highlight—sleek, modern, and minimalist. It seamlessly blends into any room, and the slim bezels ensure that your focus is always on the screen. It’s a stylish addition to my living room, and the overall build quality feels premium.  Lastly, I want to commend the delivery service. The TV arrived on time, exactly as promised, in perfect condition. The packaging was secure, and the setup process was hassle-free.  Overall, Wooble has done an outstanding job with this QLED TV. For a Made-in-India brand, it competes with international brands in terms of both performance and design. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Remote buttons have poor response - after 3 to 5 press of button, it mostly responds once - the hassles to the user is enormous. However, Amazon policy does not allow replacement of only remote. Either return the product in totality or live with the problematic accessories. So, after taking out from the box and then installation taking about 4 to 5 hours, customer will have to undo all and then re-pack. What a punishment for the customer! Please surely to be carefull while buing any consumer durable from Amazon. 2. Wall mounting kit is actually a clamp to hang the TV and no tilting to change viewing angle is possible. The word ""kit"" is a misnomer. 3. Picture quality is more or less OK; colour response and contrast are poor",NEGATIVE
Nice product picture quality is good sound is good make in india product,POSITIVE
Audio quality is truly horrible 😔,NEGATIVE
Good quality nice product faster installation paisa vasul,POSITIVE
Poor Sound Quality and Picture Clarity. HD version is better this QLED version. My suggestions is not go for it. Waste of Money.,NEGATIVE
This Monitor is from FRONTECH a branded company.  My this Rewiew is after one month use of the Monitor.  The Picture quality is very nice.  Connectivity preferences VGA and HDMI are very useful.  Thanks to you all.,POSITIVE
"⭐☆☆☆☆ (1/5)  I recently purchased the Frontech 19-inch monitor, and unfortunately, my experience has been quite disappointing.  Upon receiving the monitor, I noticed that the stand was defective—it was wobbly and didn't provide a stable base. This made it difficult to use, as the monitor kept shifting position with the slightest touch.  Additionally, I encountered an issue with the screen itself. There were noticeable white blurs in the corners, which was very distracting, especially during video playback and when viewing images. This significantly impacted my ability to use the monitor for any kind of detailed work.  Overall, I'm really frustrated with this purchase. I expected better quality for the price. I would not recommend this monitor to anyone, as both the stand and screen issues made it unusable for my needs. I'm in the process of returning it and looking for a more reliable option. Save yourself the hassle!  Forntech moniter seller can you pls contect me my email is 2vansh80@gmail.com",NEGATIVE
good product offer . value for money. good packing and home delivery. base stand design is very flimsy and delicate. installation and commissioning was easy. good prformance so far,POSITIVE
it's an excellent product at this Price. I purchased a 20-inch Monitor and using it for WFH purposes. This review I'm inking on the very first day of the use and very satisfied.,POSITIVE
The display quality is not so good. The colour contrast is also not good specially the red colour when you watch a video. But as per the price it is a OK product but if you invest Rs.1000 more then you will get a better product. I bought it for office clerical work.,NEGATIVE
"I received a defective product from day1 , there is green lines in the monitor, called Amazon customer care but they were unable to replace the product as they faced issue in that .. asked me to take refund but still no update yet... Product was delivered on 30th October 2024.  I had a service centre replacement option which was valid for seven days ... So took it personally to service centre which was 29 km from my location... The positive side of the service center was they immediately replaced with another product (although the product was not latest manufactured , as that was not available so they gave me option if I can accept 5 months older product which was working and left in stock... I took that working one... As the warranty remains the same they told me..)  So in short the product is cleap.. but you may have to bear your own cost too , as seller is not trustworthy, and Amazon too could not rectify that. If you want to buy it will be upon your luck.",NEGATIVE

If you're looking for a compact monitor that combines both form and function, this model is definitely worth considering.",POSITIVE
"This has to be the worst monitor money can buy.  Even if it was made of cardboard, the frame would’ve been stronger than what it is. The scientists at frontech might’ve invented a new material to make it weaker than paper it self.  The wall mount holes are not the standard VESA 75 or 100. The guys have come up with their own standard and there’s not even a manual to refer to.  The monitor stand and frame arrived broken. Yes, it’s is very inexpensive but even then this is not worth the money.",NEGATIVE
Nice tv picture quality is super this products are value for money,POSITIVE
"Good Sharp picture , easy setup for smart TV , sound is high on treble , better speakers could have been provided.",POSITIVE
"Top quality TVs (Sony, Samsung, LG) are about 2.5-3 times the price... cheap TV (but reputed names.. like MI, Micromax) are abt 2 times this price - this is so low price (other similar priced TVs were of unknown brands.. Kevin has made some name/presence by now), I was pretty sure it was a cheap quality dud! I thought if this TV lasted the warranty period, then its still value for money,... so i took the risk. TV arrived.. it stopped working on the same day!!!!!! inspection+replacement request registered with amazon.. smooth experience there, finally replaced.. and the new TV works perfectly. Note - the installation+warranty time servicing+repairs etc.. has been outsourced by Kevin to a third party company called Jeeves.. they're all digital, with all communications and visits etc recorded via sms-es, emails, etc... very professional. So, if tv ever gets spoilt, the toll-free experience+service/repair experience should be trouble-free. Also Note - There is an extended warranty provided at the time of purchase - for such a cheap tv, if I had 1 yr of extra warranty, then why not? But fr some reason I could not purchase the extended warranty. But at the time of installation, the Jeeves technician offered me extended warranty from them - so, i bought - 2 yrs for 1100Rs. Am glad I couldn't buy extended warranty at time of checkout.. and since Jeeves is the main entity handling repairs etc, it was better to buy from them... So now my cheap TV has a 1+2=3yr warranty! Nice!!!  TV - picture quality - OK.. does the job pretty well, the 15k-20k+Rs TV will be better.. but I don't care, at this price. The non-HD channels have slightly pixellated edges, but I noticed that if I reduced the sharpness to 0, the problem goes away. Everything else is all good - only thing is the ""whites"" seems a bit over-exposed/too bright, and if you reduce the brightness and contrast so that pure white ares of the picture looks alright, then the dark/shadowy/black areas of the picture appear too dark... you have to strike a balance(best settings worked for me at - Brightness-55, Contrast-35, Sharpness-0, Colour/Saturation-35... good balance of reducing overexposed whites and maximising dark-zone clarity), but trust me.. at this price, this is nothing, and you would have a good viewing experience. All other features - eco mode, sound, build quality etc is pretty decent.. no complaints there.  Final verdict - Go for it! super low price, pretty good viewing experience.. total value for money.. definitely go for it if your priority is getting max for your money.. if priority is quality, go for samsung, lg etc. Also, I'd suggest - skip the extended warranty and buy the same at installation time from the Jeeves technician - he may not offer it to you on his own, so ask for it.",NEGATIVE
"Here's a sample review:  *Disappointed with Post-Purchase Experience - Chargeable Installation*  *Rating: 2/5*  I purchased the vw tv from Amazon on 20 oct and received it on 24th October. The delivery was prompt, and the product seems to be in good condition.  However, my excitement was short-lived. When I contacted the installation team, I was informed that installation would be chargeable, which was not mentioned at the time of purchase. This added expense was unexpected and feels like a bait-and-switch.  *Pros:*  - Prompt delivery - Good product quality  *Cons:*  - Misleading information regarding installation costs - Additional charges for installation  *Suggestions:*  - Clearly mention installation costs (if applicable) on the product page - Provide transparent and accurate information to customers before purchase  *Recommendation:*  While the TV itself is satisfactory, the post-purchase experience has left a sour taste. Buyers, beware of potential additional costs. Amazon, please clarify installation costs upfront to avoid disappointing customers.",NEGATIVE
EXCELLENT PRODUCT WITH GOOD REASONABLE AMOUNT MY FAMILY IS VERY HAPY,POSITIVE
"I am extremely impressed with this VW TV! The picture quality is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and sharp details, making it perfect for watching movies and shows. The sound is also surprisingly good for a TV of this size, filling the room nicely without needing a soundbar. The setup was quick and easy, and the smart features work flawlessly, allowing me to stream all my favorite apps without any lag. It's a great value for the price, perfect for smaller rooms or as a second TV. Highly recommend.",POSITIVE

Best product in this price range. No other brands provide such type of features in this price range. Pros- 1. Best picture quality 2. Good sound quality. 20W speaker provide nice sound for watching movies and tv series. 3. Good customer care support 4. Android OS and playstore available. 5. All connectivity ports are available. Cons. * Installation services is very bad. Service provider not available even after 10 days of delivery.,NEGATIVE
Good product,POSITIVE
"The TV itself is good, and I’ve owned TCL products before without issues. However, purchasing high-value items from Amazon comes with serious risks due to their poor post-purchase support.  Installation was repeatedly delayed, and despite multiple follow-ups, no resolution was provided. Customer support was unprofessional, unhelpful, and unwilling to take ownership of the issue. I ultimately had to return the product—not because of TCL, but due to Amazon’s failure to provide the necessary service.  If you’re considering buying expensive electronics here, be prepared for a frustrating experience if you ever need support.",NEGATIVE
Good quality for this price. If u choose other brands you have to pay ₹5000 to 15000 extra .,POSITIVE
"I bought TCL 75 inches 4K UHD LED TV after lot of research on specifications and price bargain.  This TV is really a catch @ Rs 69,990 when I bought in December 2023. Great deal on 75 inches TV. Thanks to TCL.  Moreover, the colours and brightness and viewing pleasure is really very satisfactory.  I was dreaming to buy Mini LED TV but it was very costly and out of my budget. So I closed down on this great value for money deal on TCL 75 inches giant screen TV at an amazing price tag of Rs 69,990.  Sound is 30W RMS. It's really crystal clear and very good to listen each minute audio detail. I have a soundbar but now no need to use it as the TV sound is almost like a soundbar and it's powerful.  TV has got HDMI eARC connectivity. I am using soundbar as well as Sony wireless headphone L600 - both with eARC connectivity. So it was super easy to connect my soundbar as well as wireles headphone with TCL TV seamlessly.  The remote controller unit is also very nice. It's bit slim and long which looks different from other brands and easy to handle. All required shortcut buttons are given.  It's a Google TV. So supports Google voice search.  We are very happy on our decision to buy TCL 75 inches 4K UHD TV.  I hope this TV will serve us for few years to come without any technical problems. I will post my post use feedback soon in next year 2024.  Thank you.",POSITIVE
TCL is affordable price very good picture quality this TV equal samsung & Sony viewing experience,POSITIVE
Quality is very good.,POSITIVE
"We bought the TV 3 months back. In a month, the TV started getting hanged and did not work smoothly. Even after following all the instructions, the problem didn't get solved. Also the after service of the company is pathetic. When we asked to replace the product, they denied and did made reasons like technician will come and check the product. It's been more than 20 days we are trying to reach th but no one is responding to our complaint. Also the customer care number that is mentioned is of no use as no one answered or addressed our complaint. There is Lag, poor picture quality before the TV started getting hanged. And now TV is not working at all. It's stuck on TCL logo and keeping getting restart, doesn't go ahead of it. Never buy or go for TCL products as they don't respond or replace the product even when it's in the warranty period.  Just because it's less price, don't buy it as money gets wasted. Better to put extra and buy another brand.",NEGATIVE

"If you're looking for a 55-inch 4K TV with excellent picture quality, a wide range of features, and a user-friendly interface at an affordable price, I highly recommend the Xiaomi Smart TV X Pro.  Here are some of the things I love about it:  The picture quality is good. The 4K resolution, HDR10+, Dolby Vision IQ, and MEMC all work together to deliver a truly immersive viewing experience. The wide viewing angles mean that you can enjoy the same great picture quality from anywhere in the room. Google TV is a great platform but its slower than LG or Samsung, with a wide range of apps and features, including hands-free Google Assistant support it good. The sound quality is not that good but with dolby content its good, especially for a TV at this price point. The price is very affordable, especially with the credit card offer and big billion discount that I was able to take advantage of. I got this @41500 Overall, I'm very happy with the Xiaomi Smart TV X Pro 55-inch. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great value for money 55-inch 4K TV.",POSITIVE

"I have purchased Mi TV in March and it started giving issues within a month only. I have requested services several times but my TV is still not working properly. Now today, it started giving block & white lines then suddenly, TV stopped working & nothing is visible on the screen. I will never recommend Mi TV to anyone. Its services is very worst. Their is no number to whom we can contact regarding the issue. They just say book an appointment, engineer will visit & repair and they just disconnect the call every time. I'm too much fed up and frustrated with the TV. Neither they come & repair the TV nor they replace the same. Their engineer/technician doesn't come on time and the person named Surender Pal Rajput never speak in good way. Whenever we call him, he is in a hurry to just end up the call. My hard earned money got wasted. I'll recommend to everyone NOT TO PURCHASE XIAOMI MI TV You will surely regret one day.",NEGATIVE
"All must have features included in this TV. Good picture quality, sound, user friendly interface. Don’t buy such costly TV like other brands. Because actual life of smart TV is just 4-5 years. And after that if your any tv starts trouble shooting that replace with new one. Because repairing cost is as much as high as you can buy a new tv by adding some more amount. Overall best tv in this price range.",NEGATIVE

Patchwall works fine to watch free live TV. Inbuilt Google Assistant mic easy to controlling TV and Chromecast inbuilt. Brilliant remote finishing and very sleek design.  It's 1 star BEE rated TV which consume more electric power. TV frequency refresh rate lags, should have improved in time frame. No wall mount free. No power adaptor.

"After buying 75inch TV for 1.2 lakh all the HDMI ports alone stopped working after 7 months. Since it was in warranty they tried to repair it by changing the new main board which has the HDMI ports. But remote stopped working because Bluetooth /wifi boards was not compatible with the main board. They changed to new Bluetooth board still remote was not working. They did this 3 times. Every time it takes 2 to 3 weeks to place order for new board to arrive and customer service center were silent. I had to folowup continuously every 3 days for 4 months but whatever board they change either one only works, if HDMI port works remote doesn't work and viceverse. They kept trying again and again. Then i escalated to till CEO, requested for replacement of whole new TV from the beginning. But they kept trying to repair by changing boards again and again. Finally after 4th repair attempt also failed they agreed to replace complete TV. To my surprise they bought a refurbished TV with lots of scratches without accessories like Stand, remote etc. I refused to accept it and asked them to take back. I again escalated and asked for a brand New TV. Finally after 4 months they replaced with brand new TV. But in those 4 months i went into severe mental stress because of irresponsible behavior by service person and no response from Mi company side. What I found is that nothing is manufactured by Mi. All the components are manufactured by different companies , Mi just does the branding and sales and service. Example all the board's are from TCL , screen is from RoHS. Don't buy LED TV from Mi. Mi is good for mobiles.",NEGATIVE
I've been using this product since it was launched and today I can say that it has a laggy interface and sometimes remote doesn't response. Overall it's a good tv with some bug. Go for it you want to experience an immersive display.,POSITIVE
"Value for money, liked the seamless same day installation, 4k quality seems satisfactory. TV lags slightly for a few seconds just after restart, but that's fine.",POSITIVE
"Honestly wasn’t expecting much because of the price. It is great for this price, be it with regards to the picture quality, functionalities or sound quality. Installation though pretty straightforward, Amazon screwed up with their ‘Premium Installation’, absolutely pathetic!",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this tv and a faulty unit was delivered as from day 1 the tv had screen flickering issues. I raised this with Amazon and they arranged for brands support staff visit to check the issue during which the brand technician told me that there is mismatch in the serial number i.e the serial number of the tv delivered and the serial number in the invoice downloaded from Amazon app doesn't match. So no support was provided from brands side due to this issue.  I raised this concern as well with Amazon and it has been 10 days that i have been continuously connecting with Amazon support executives and absolutely no help is being provided. They keep on transferring calls to some specialised teams which doesn't have a resolution. After continuing on each call for almost 30-45 mins , the call some how gets disconnected and on reconnecting some new staff gets alloted to whom i have to explain the same story again. This loop continues. Being a Amazon prime customer there has been no support from Amazon's side whatsoever. This is my worst experience with Amazon till date. There is still no return / replacement being provided from Amazon' side , they are asking me to contact brand support for the same. All the problems are on Amazon's side but they are not taking any onus of the same.  And i am stuck with the faulty tv...",NEGATIVE
"I decided to purchase this TV despite mixed reviews, as my previous Xiaomi Full HD TV served me well for nearly six years without any issues. I opted for the 43"" model, and after using it for 10 days, my overall impression is mixed.  The TV isn’t bad, but be prepared to invest in external speakers for a better audio experience. I’m using a JBL 4 Bluetooth speaker connected via AUX cable, which significantly enhances the content-watching experience.  The default picture and sound modes are underwhelming, requiring considerable customization to achieve satisfactory results. A major drawback is the TV's inability to accurately handle red colors, which is disappointing regardless of the settings. Another issue is the remote, which sometimes requires a second press with a firmer touch to respond properly.  As for lag, I found that if you allow the TV to fully start up and load its processes (around 2 minutes), it runs smoothly without any performance issues.  On a positive note, the installation and service provided by Amazon were seamless and hassle-free.",NEGATIVE
Great but average quality,POSITIVE
"Today i purchased the 50-inch Wooble QLED TV, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The picture quality is simply stunning—sharp, vibrant colors and deep contrasts make watching movies or shows a truly immersive experience. Whether it's HD or 4K content, the visuals are crisp and crystal clear, doing full justice to the QLED technology.  The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering rich, full-bodied audio that complements the visual experience. I didn't need any external speakers as the in-built sound system offers a well-balanced range of highs and lows, making it perfect for everything from action-packed films to quiet dialogues.  The design of the TV is another highlight—sleek, modern, and minimalist. It seamlessly blends into any room, and the slim bezels ensure that your focus is always on the screen. It’s a stylish addition to my living room, and the overall build quality feels premium.  Lastly, I want to commend the delivery service. The TV arrived on time, exactly as promised, in perfect condition. The packaging was secure, and the setup process was hassle-free.  Overall, Wooble has done an outstanding job with this QLED TV. For a Made-in-India brand, it competes with international brands in terms of both performance and design. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Remote buttons have poor response - after 3 to 5 press of button, it mostly responds once - the hassles to the user is enormous. However, Amazon policy does not allow replacement of only remote. Either return the product in totality or live with the problematic accessories. So, after taking out from the box and then installation taking about 4 to 5 hours, customer will have to undo all and then re-pack. What a punishment for the customer! Please surely to be carefull while buing any consumer durable from Amazon. 2. Wall mounting kit is actually a clamp to hang the TV and no tilting to change viewing angle is possible. The word ""kit"" is a misnomer. 3. Picture quality is more or less OK; colour response and contrast are poor",NEGATIVE

This Monitor is from FRONTECH a branded company.  My this Rewiew is after one month use of the Monitor.  The Picture quality is very nice.  Connectivity preferences VGA and HDMI are very useful.  Thanks to you all.,POSITIVE
"⭐☆☆☆☆ (1/5)  I recently purchased the Frontech 19-inch monitor, and unfortunately, my experience has been quite disappointing.  Upon receiving the monitor, I noticed that the stand was defective—it was wobbly and didn't provide a stable base. This made it difficult to use, as the monitor kept shifting position with the slightest touch.  Additionally, I encountered an issue with the screen itself. There were noticeable white blurs in the corners, which was very distracting, especially during video playback and when viewing images. This significantly impacted my ability to use the monitor for any kind of detailed work.  Overall, I'm really frustrated with this purchase. I expected better quality for the price. I would not recommend this monitor to anyone, as both the stand and screen issues made it unusable for my needs. I'm in the process of returning it and looking for a more reliable option. Save yourself the hassle!  Forntech moniter seller can you pls contect me my email is 2vansh80@gmail.com",NEGATIVE
good product offer . value for money. good packing and home delivery. base stand design is very flimsy and delicate. installation and commissioning was easy. good prformance so far,POSITIVE
it's an excellent product at this Price. I purchased a 20-inch Monitor and using it for WFH purposes. This review I'm inking on the very first day of the use and very satisfied.,POSITIVE
The display quality is not so good. The colour contrast is also not good specially the red colour when you watch a video. But as per the price it is a OK product but if you invest Rs.1000 more then you will get a better product. I bought it for office clerical work.,NEGATIVE
"I received a defective product from day1 , there is green lines in the monitor, called Amazon customer care but they were unable to replace the product as they faced issue in that .. asked me to take refund but still no update yet... Product was delivered on 30th October 2024.  I had a service centre replacement option which was valid for seven days ... So took it personally to service centre which was 29 km from my location... The positive side of the service center was they immediately replaced with another product (although the product was not latest manufactured , as that was not available so they gave me option if I can accept 5 months older product which was working and left in stock... I took that working one... As the warranty remains the same they told me..)  So in short the product is cleap.. but you may have to bear your own cost too , as seller is not trustworthy, and Amazon too could not rectify that. If you want to buy it will be upon your luck.",NEGATIVE

If you're looking for a compact monitor that combines both form and function, this model is definitely worth considering.",POSITIVE
"This has to be the worst monitor money can buy.  Even if it was made of cardboard, the frame would’ve been stronger than what it is. The scientists at frontech might’ve invented a new material to make it weaker than paper it self.  The wall mount holes are not the standard VESA 75 or 100. The guys have come up with their own standard and there’s not even a manual to refer to.  The monitor stand and frame arrived broken. Yes, it’s is very inexpensive but even then this is not worth the money.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased a Kodak TV, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance and value for money. The picture quality is truly exceptional, delivering vibrant colors and crisp details that enhance the viewing experience. The sound output is clear and immersive, making it perfect for watching movies and enjoying music.  The user interface is intuitive and responsive, offering easy access to a variety of apps and streaming platforms.

"Top quality TVs (Sony, Samsung, LG) are about 2.5-3 times the price... cheap TV (but reputed names.. like MI, Micromax) are abt 2 times this price - this is so low price (other similar priced TVs were of unknown brands.. Kevin has made some name/presence by now), I was pretty sure it was a cheap quality dud! I thought if this TV lasted the warranty period, then its still value for money,... so i took the risk. TV arrived.. it stopped working on the same day!!!!!! inspection+replacement request registered with amazon.. smooth experience there, finally replaced.. and the new TV works perfectly. Note - the installation+warranty time servicing+repairs etc.. has been outsourced by Kevin to a third party company called Jeeves.. they're all digital, with all communications and visits etc recorded via sms-es, emails, etc... very professional. So, if tv ever gets spoilt, the toll-free experience+service/repair experience should be trouble-free. Also Note - There is an extended warranty provided at the time of purchase - for such a cheap tv, if I had 1 yr of extra warranty, then why not? But fr some reason I could not purchase the extended warranty. But at the time of installation, the Jeeves technician offered me extended warranty from them - so, i bought - 2 yrs for 1100Rs. Am glad I couldn't buy extended warranty at time of checkout.. and since Jeeves is the main entity handling repairs etc, it was better to buy from them... So now my cheap TV has a 1+2=3yr warranty! Nice!!!  TV - picture quality - OK.. does the job pretty well, the 15k-20k+Rs TV will be better.. but I don't care, at this price. The non-HD channels have slightly pixellated edges, but I noticed that if I reduced the sharpness to 0, the problem goes away. Everything else is all good - only thing is the ""whites"" seems a bit over-exposed/too bright, and if you reduce the brightness and contrast so that pure white ares of the picture looks alright, then the dark/shadowy/black areas of the picture appear too dark... you have to strike a balance(best settings worked for me at - Brightness-55, Contrast-35, Sharpness-0, Colour/Saturation-35... good balance of reducing overexposed whites and maximising dark-zone clarity), but trust me.. at this price, this is nothing, and you would have a good viewing experience. All other features - eco mode, sound, build quality etc is pretty decent.. no complaints there.  Final verdict - Go for it! super low price, pretty good viewing experience.. total value for money.. definitely go for it if your priority is getting max for your money.. if priority is quality, go for samsung, lg etc. Also, I'd suggest - skip the extended warranty and buy the same at installation time from the Jeeves technician - he may not offer it to you on his own, so ask for it.",NEGATIVE
"Here's a sample review:  *Disappointed with Post-Purchase Experience - Chargeable Installation*  *Rating: 2/5*  I purchased the vw tv from Amazon on 20 oct and received it on 24th October. The delivery was prompt, and the product seems to be in good condition.  However, my excitement was short-lived. When I contacted the installation team, I was informed that installation would be chargeable, which was not mentioned at the time of purchase. This added expense was unexpected and feels like a bait-and-switch.  *Pros:*  - Prompt delivery - Good product quality  *Cons:*  - Misleading information regarding installation costs - Additional charges for installation  *Suggestions:*  - Clearly mention installation costs (if applicable) on the product page - Provide transparent and accurate information to customers before purchase  *Recommendation:*  While the TV itself is satisfactory, the post-purchase experience has left a sour taste. Buyers, beware of potential additional costs. Amazon, please clarify installation costs upfront to avoid disappointing customers.",NEGATIVE
EXCELLENT PRODUCT WITH GOOD REASONABLE AMOUNT MY FAMILY IS VERY HAPY,POSITIVE
"I am extremely impressed with this VW TV! The picture quality is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and sharp details, making it perfect for watching movies and shows. The sound is also surprisingly good for a TV of this size, filling the room nicely without needing a soundbar.

It's a great value for the price, perfect for smaller rooms or as a second TV. Highly recommend.",POSITIVE

Best product in this price range. No other brands provide such type of features in this price range. Pros- 1. Best picture quality 2. Good sound quality. 20W speaker provide nice sound for watching movies and tv series. 3. Good customer care support 4. Android OS and playstore available. 5. All connectivity ports are available. Cons. * Installation services is very bad. Service provider not available even after 10 days of delivery.,NEGATIVE
"I bought a Kodak TV, which was well within my budget and I needed this TV for very minimalistic usage. nonetheless, it has exceeded my expectations regarding functionality and picture quality. I generally don't write reviews but this TV's performance compelled me to write it. So if anyone is planning to buy any TV of the most sold brand this is comfortably competing with them and way ahead in terms of value for money and smooth remote function. I will go for it again if needed. Feature and remote buttons are very user-friendly.",POSITIVE

"I purchased a Kodak TV on January 9th, 2025, but unfortunately, it stopped working within 10 days. The screen went blank, and despite numerous attempts, I couldn't get a proper response from Kodak's customer service.  It's been over 10 days, and no action has been taken to resolve the issue. To make matters worse, calling the customer care number is a frustrating experience, with wait times exceeding 30 minutes.  I would advise potential buyers to think twice before purchasing a Kodak TV due to their poor after-sales service.",NEGATIVE
"The sound quality is good. I didn't experience any installation issue. They called, came and installed all the components. The screen is not that best but keeping in mind of the budget the screen is decent without any complaint. Overall, first experience, the TV is looking good.

"At the time of purchase, my requirement was just for a 32-inch LED TV that supports HDMI connection because I needed to put this in Guard room so that he can watch the camera recordings. When I bought this product, I got it for a very reasonable price and that too with the functions it support. It has built-in android so that we can download all the OTT apps for our entertainment. I didn't buy it for those functions but having them in this price is nice. Also, I thought that these features are just for marketing and we will not get the quality and apps would hang, but, I was wrong, they work fine and the display quality is also very good. I am satisfied with this product, and it fulfils all my requirements.  P.S.: I didn't connect Wi-fi on this TV, or else the guard would wind up watching youtube for the whole day😅😅.",POSITIVE

"If you're looking for a 55-inch 4K TV with excellent picture quality, a wide range of features, and a user-friendly interface at an affordable price, I highly recommend the Xiaomi Smart TV X Pro.  Here are some of the things I love about it:  The picture quality is good. The 4K resolution, HDR10+, Dolby Vision IQ, and MEMC all work together to deliver a truly immersive viewing experience. The wide viewing angles mean that you can enjoy the same great picture quality from anywhere in the room. Google TV is a great platform but its slower than LG or Samsung, with a wide range of apps and features, including hands-free Google Assistant support it good. The sound quality is not that good but with dolby content its good, especially for a TV at this price point. The price is very affordable, especially with the credit card offer and big billion discount that I was able to take advantage of. I got this @41500 Overall, I'm very happy with the Xiaomi Smart TV X Pro 55-inch. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great value for money 55-inch 4K TV.",POSITIVE

"I have purchased Mi TV in March and it started giving issues within a month only. I have requested services several times but my TV is still not working properly. Now today, it started giving block & white lines then suddenly, TV stopped working & nothing is visible on the screen. I will never recommend Mi TV to anyone. Its services is very worst. Their is no number to whom we can contact regarding the issue. They just say book an appointment, engineer will visit & repair and they just disconnect the call every time. I'm too much fed up and frustrated with the TV. Neither they come & repair the TV nor they replace the same. Their engineer/technician doesn't come on time and the person named Surender Pal Rajput never speak in good way. Whenever we call him, he is in a hurry to just end up the call. My hard earned money got wasted. I'll recommend to everyone NOT TO PURCHASE XIAOMI MI TV You will surely regret one day.",NEGATIVE
"All must have features included in this TV. Good picture quality, sound, user friendly interface. Don’t buy such costly TV like other brands. Because actual life of smart TV is just 4-5 years. And after that if your any tv starts trouble shooting that replace with new one. Because repairing cost is as much as high as you can buy a new tv by adding some more amount. Overall best tv in this price range.",NEGATIVE

"Overall 4K performance is very good. Very sleek, elegant look and attractive design. Dolby vision enhance the colour, Black brightness performance is very good. Dolby Atmos/DTS sound is ok and should have enhanced the experience. Dual network, works with 5G for better internet speed. Google TV and Alexa Fire TV both function well with their assistants. Patchwall works fine to watch free live TV. Inbuilt Google Assistant mic easy to controlling TV and Chromecast inbuilt. Brilliant remote finishing and very sleek design.  It's 1 star BEE rated TV which consume more electric power. TV frequency refresh rate lags, should have improved in time frame. No wall mount free. No power adaptor.  Installation is from Amazon, they are charging high amount for wall mount comparing with MI brand. Suggest to get installation from MI brand.  Giving 4 star for installation hidden/false charges and TV frequency refresh rate.",POSITIVE
Enough quality display,POSITIVE
"I recently upgraded to the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV, and I’m quite impressed by what it delivers at its price point. Here’s my personal take:  Picture Quality:  The 4K resolution with Dolby Vision really stands out. Watching UHD content is a treat, with vibrant colors and clear details, especially in brighter scenes. However, when streaming SDR content or older shows, you might notice some graininess, especially on larger screens like the 65-inch model. Adjusting the backlight and saturation can help if you prefer more natural tones, as the default settings can be a bit too vivid for my taste.  Sound:  The 30W speakers are surprisingly good for regular TV viewing, supporting Dolby Audio and DTS. For everyday use, they’re loud and clear enough, but I found the bass to be lacking, so if you're a fan of deep, immersive sound, investing in a soundbar might be a good idea.  User Interface:  Google TV is easy to navigate, and I love how it suggests shows and movies across platforms based on my viewing habits. Plus, Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature is a great addition, giving access to over 200 live channels without extra subscriptions. Switching between apps is generally smooth, though I noticed slight lag after prolonged use, but it’s nothing that impacts the overall experience too much.  Design:  The sleek black design with thin bezels looks great in any room. I opted to mount mine on the wall, which I think suits the larger models better as they can take up a lot of space on a stand. It's not a premium build, but it’s sturdy and fits well with modern interiors.  Smoothness In terms of smoothness, the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV is decent but not flawless. The TV is powered by a quad-core A55 chipset, paired with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. For regular tasks like switching between apps, browsing, and streaming, the performance is generally smooth. However, some users have reported occasional lag, especially after prolonged use or when loading heavier apps. It's not a dealbreaker, but the experience might not be as snappy as higher-end models.  The Google TV interface is a big plus here, as it runs efficiently, with intuitive navigation and quick access to content across various platforms. Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature adds to the smoothness, with seamless integration of live TV and streaming apps into one unified experience.  For basic daily use, the smoothness is acceptable, but if you’re after a flawless, zero-lag experience, you might notice occasional slowdowns with heavy multitasking.  Final Thoughts:  Overall, the Xiaomi X Series delivers excellent value for anyone seeking a 4K TV with smart features at an affordable price. Its picture quality shines with UHD content, and the Google TV integration is intuitive. Just be prepared for some occasional performance hiccups and consider adding external speakers if audio quality is a priority for you.",POSITIVE
"Very good and colourful panel, deep blacks, moderate viewing angles. Metal back feels solid. Speaker is also lound and clear. One con is that TV sometimes get slow and ui frames caps to like 30 hz, but it is rare. Hope this issue gets solved by update. Overall if anyone wants fabulous picture quality this should be a very good option. I got the tv at 21750 during sale, so it is value for money product",POSITIVE
"I bought it in August 2024 the packaging was good damage on executive delivered the product at my doorstep and the check the product whether it was damage or not then after 2 hours MI service centre technician called me for installation and they reach to my home within 1 hour and installed the product but I have to pay it extra 500 rupees for the Wall mount because the Wall mount was not including in the box but that is okay because the Wall mount brand is also MI, functionality of the product is good picture quality is good enough features of the product is good but the space of internal storage is not enough(only 8gb,free space is about 4gb)it should be 16GB or more for internal memory, installation was very quick and we are using the TV for last 2 month for me it's a good product I got it from Amazon at rupees of 20700 and extra 500 I paid for the Wall mount so basically it was a good deal but after that the TV was sold in great Indian festival at rupees of 17700 so I missed the opportunity to buy the product at a low price of that never mind, the product connectivity is good, picture quality was very good just go for it",NEGATIVE
As i purchase this Mi A Pro tv because of new launch and affordable price. As i can see some lag in OS as well as playing any 4k content and the internet speed was slow as i connected it through Hotspot...it was taking some time to load even though my internet speed was 300mbps and the delivery guys carelessly kept this Tv flat in their vehicle but tnx there was no damage rather then everything is good worth buying and i hope they fix some bugs in next update Quick Pros* Excellent Picture Quality Excellent Sound Build quality is good Affordable Price Worth buying  Cons* ( which i faced ) Little lag in OS & 4k content Response time is little slow Stand build quality is not good,NEGATIVE
"The worst ever sound quality. Good display but with performance lag! After a week, sound became weaker than it was in the beginning! No more option to replace the TV or replace with another brand!!",NEGATIVE
"Purchased this tv in July 2024 and after using it for around 5 months now, I can say that it's a really good TV. After doing so much research I finalized this tv over other brands like Sony samsung lg TCL acer etc. others are offering similar features at higher price. But this tv came in just around 20.5k.  Pros: - Best picture quality - looks premium in the room - most amazing part is sound is loud, clear and balanced. Never faced audio issues like other TVs. In other TVs either music is good but not loud enough or bass is too much that you can't watch movies with clear sound. We were thinking of having speakers and hometheater but dropped that idea after having this tv as the sound is good, loud and best - installation was quick and easy - UI is really good. Never hangs even while playing Dolby vision 4k HD videos - Gets regular software updates - remote is sleek and has better button replacement than other tv remotes - customer care called me after 2 months to take my feedback about tv. Such things don't exist in today's world. Felt good that customer care actually cares  I had already used or seen mi tv(parents have one), redmi tv(brother have one), acer tv(friend has this), sony tv(cousin has this), TCL tv(another friend has this), OnePlus tv(one friend has this). , so I had experience with tvs of all these companies... They have issues like low sound, bad picture quality, software hanging, tv getting slow after a few months even if updated etc.... after enough comparisons and experience I can say that Kodak tv is best and worth the amount you spend.  Go for this tv if on low budget like me. It's worth every penny.",POSITIVE
"Awesome sturdiness, easy to use, clear pictures, odisha sound. But overall value for money",POSITIVE
"I’ve been using this budget-friendly Android TV for over a year now, and it has been a great experience overall. The picture quality has remained sharp, and the performance is consistent with smooth app functionality and minimal lag. It’s impressive how reliable this TV has been for the price!  That said, the remote has been a bit of a challenge—it stopped working properly a few months ago. Fortunately, the TV’s mobile app has been a lifesaver, offering a seamless remote control alternative.  For the price, this TV delivers excellent value, and despite the minor remote issue, I would still recommend it for anyone looking for an affordable smart TV option.",POSITIVE

Good product,POSITIVE
"The TV itself is good, and I’ve owned TCL products before without issues. However, purchasing high-value items from Amazon comes with serious risks due to their poor post-purchase support.  Installation was repeatedly delayed, and despite multiple follow-ups, no resolution was provided. Customer support was unprofessional, unhelpful, and unwilling to take ownership of the issue. I ultimately had to return the product—not because of TCL, but due to Amazon’s failure to provide the necessary service.  If you’re considering buying expensive electronics here, be prepared for a frustrating experience if you ever need support.",NEGATIVE
Good quality for this price. If u choose other brands you have to pay ₹5000 to 15000 extra .,POSITIVE
"I bought TCL 75 inches 4K UHD LED TV after lot of research on specifications and price bargain.  This TV is really a catch @ Rs 69,990 when I bought in December 2023. Great deal on 75 inches TV. Thanks to TCL.  Moreover, the colours and brightness and viewing pleasure is really very satisfactory.  I was dreaming to buy Mini LED TV but it was very costly and out of my budget. So I closed down on this great value for money deal on TCL 75 inches giant screen TV at an amazing price tag of Rs 69,990.  Sound is 30W RMS. It's really crystal clear and very good to listen each minute audio detail. I have a soundbar but now no need to use it as the TV sound is almost like a soundbar and it's powerful.  TV has got HDMI eARC connectivity. I am using soundbar as well as Sony wireless headphone L600 - both with eARC connectivity. So it was super easy to connect my soundbar as well as wireles headphone with TCL TV seamlessly.  The remote controller unit is also very nice. It's bit slim and long which looks different from other brands and easy to handle. All required shortcut buttons are given.  It's a Google TV. So supports Google voice search.  We are very happy on our decision to buy TCL 75 inches 4K UHD TV.  I hope this TV will serve us for few years to come without any technical problems. I will post my post use feedback soon in next year 2024.  Thank you.",POSITIVE
TCL is affordable price very good picture quality this TV equal samsung & Sony viewing experience,POSITIVE
Quality is very good.,POSITIVE
"We bought the TV 3 months back. In a month, the TV started getting hanged and did not work smoothly. Even after following all the instructions, the problem didn't get solved. Also the after service of the company is pathetic. When we asked to replace the product, they denied and did made reasons like technician will come and check the product. It's been more than 20 days we are trying to reach th but no one is responding to our complaint. Also the customer care number that is mentioned is of no use as no one answered or addressed our complaint. There is Lag, poor picture quality before the TV started getting hanged. And now TV is not working at all. It's stuck on TCL logo and keeping getting restart, doesn't go ahead of it. Never buy or go for TCL products as they don't respond or replace the product even when it's in the warranty period.  Just because it's less price, don't buy it as money gets wasted. Better to put extra and buy another brand.",NEGATIVE
Nice tv but it do not come with wall Mount,NEGATIVE
"Toshiba TVs are known for their exceptional picture quality and impressive performance. The vibrant colors, sharp details, and smooth motion make the viewing experience truly enjoyable. Whether you're watching movies, sports, or playing games, the display quality never fails to impress. Additionally, the sound clarity and build quality reflect Toshiba's commitment to excellence. Overall, it's a great choice for anyone looking for a premium yet affordable TV. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Toshiba 55-inch TV and I must say, I am extremely impressed with the overall performance and quality of this product. The picture quality is outstanding, with vibrant colors and sharp details that make watching movies and TV shows a truly immersive experience. The sound quality is also top-notch, providing clear and crisp audio that enhances the viewing experience.  I appreciate the sleek and modern design of it ,which looks great in my living room and adds a touch of elegance to the space. The setup was quick and easy, and the user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it a breeze to navigate through different settings and apps.

Giveing review after 1 month of use Pros- Overally video and audio Clearity is awesome. Value for money. Cons- In high moving object like while watching cricket observe when ball moves faster it gets blur some time it's seems 2-3 ball are moves faster back to back like that. In short MEMC not provided or not working properly. But it's not big issue,POSITIVE
"The performance of the Toshiba TV is excellent! The picture quality is vibrant, the sound is crisp, and the overall experience has been great. However, the installation process could have been better. While the setup was completed, one side of the TV is slightly tilted down, which was a bit disappointing.  Despite this minor issue, the TV itself delivers an outstanding viewing experience, and I’m very satisfied with the product. Highly recommend it for its performance!",POSITIVE
"The TV is awsome, very nice picture quality and dolby atmos is too good. At this price point you can't ask for more. Yes in comparison to all Android tv this is a bit slow but faster than the rest.  Important part- I read many negative comments or reviews regarding installation failure. The same happened with me, however with constant communication with Amazon they helped me to get the tv installed within the scheduled time. Yes if you are polite enough anyone will help you out.  There are reviews regarding the tv shutting down itself after some time. The same thing happened with me. But it's a energy saving feature of the TV, if you keep it in idle condition it will shutdown. That is a good feature. But illeterate consumers doesn't understand nor study the manual before posting such reviews. It's an awsome tv go for it",NEGATIVE
"TV is a good buy at this price point. Picture quality could have been better, sound is clear and loud. Overall a nice tv.",POSITIVE
"Positives: overall good performance, 2 years of warranty.  Negatives: White light bleeding at the edges of screen very clearly visible in grey screen.",NEGATIVE
"At this price range this is the only TV maybe which has 2 GB RAM, others come at 1 or 1.5 GB RAM. So as a Smart TV you are able to get a glitch free interface.",NEGATIVE
"Tv picture quality was very good in 55 inchs. Remote quality was also very good. But installation was bad he use very low quality bracket due to which tv was tilted towards front. Value for money, sound of tv was awesome. Must buy",POSITIVE
Tv is very good. Installed with electrician. Amazon installation persons never came. Buy from flipkart,POSITIVE
Good clarity and nice sound. but installation team is not professional,NEGATIVE
"Never brought this TV from Amazon. The amazon courier service was very bad. 1st time they delay the service to deliver the TV due to late delivery I cancelled the order. I order it again for 2nd time. Then 2nd issue was they didn't give the installation service. My experience for order this TV through Amazon was bad.  But TCL TV was very good 👍. The picture, sound and features are awesome. It comes with Dolby Atmos, Dolby vision, Onkoy 2.1 sound subwoofer, HDR 10. The Google applications are performing very smoothly. I recommend to all TV lover please brought this TV to experience a great picture, sound and other features of TV.",POSITIVE
Best tv in price and size,POSITIVE
"I got faulty TV, IR receiver inside TV didn’t responded. I need to raise warranty service request but they responded with worst solutions, later they assigned technicians to fix it. Technician contacted me by saying that I need to pay him 450INR to come to my home and fix it. I asked him, why i need to pay when its under warranty, but he denied saying that TV company will give them only 150INR to do the job, which will not cover my petrol costs also. Then he warned me saying that if i am interested for that price he will come to do service else leave. I contacted customer care and reported the issue with Technician, they said he should not take any money, and from their side they also escalated the issue. No reply from anyone, so i contacted technician again and said will see after the job done about money, first visit. He came and tried to do something with remote but no use. So he left that day saying he will be back again. After 2 days he came and opened TV , there we can see clearly that IR receiver cable is not connected to board. Its simply a assembly issue in manufacturing. He just clipped it, it worked. He asked for 750rs , then i asked it its under warranty right why i need to pay but he denied. Then he argued a lot and took money. Such a Worst customer care by TCL.  One more thing is that Amazon misleading or miscommunication about the product, by displaying it as OLED Tv . I thought its OLED and purchased but its not Oled tv. I got cheated by amazon",NEGATIVE
"not a qled, no mention of qled in box. pixel density is bad looks pixeleted even in 4k from close , delivery was late, charged me another 1000 rupees, which is a scam it offers a 200rs mounting kit. If you ask them to reschedule they asked me to install on my own. They will just claim the warranty and leave. Other this works fine with the tv perticularly game mode makes a good smoothing.",NEGATIVE

"JVC TV Review – Great Value for Money!  I recently got a JVC TV, and it’s been a fantastic purchase! The picture quality is sharp and vibrant, making movies and games look great. Sound is clear and decent, though a soundbar enhances the experience. The smart features work smoothly, with easy navigation and quick access to apps.

"The TV's picture quality is far below expectations, failing to meet even basic HD standards despite being marketed as QLED. The remote’s voice command and Google Assistant are non-functional, and it lacks a mute button. Despite repeated complaints, no technician has visited, and no complaint number was provided, showing a lack of transparency and accountability.",NEGATIVE

"Background : I was in search for a good but not pricey TV because of the following  1. My Samsung 49"" K6300 Curved TV had gone kaput in 4-5 years (DOP - Somewhere in 2017 - early 2018) 2. I was dragging my old TV with ever growing shadows accompanied with visibility issues. 3. K6300 was an eye pleasure when in good condition with amazing blacks and motion smoothness - beautiful out of the box colors.  Since a Tier 1 brand like Samsung had betrayed the trust after paying a premium , I was in the lookout of a mid range TV with up-to-date features - my check list included the following  1. Solid warranty clause with no Money extorsion policies like LG OLED post 1 year end. 2. Good sound system - Preferably with a sub-woofer. 3. Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.  I think I am tending to increase ratings from 4 to 5 stars. Just for the REGZA Pic & Sound from Toshiba.  Good and durable Japanese brands Like Sanyo, Toshiba, Panasonic ( that bring in proprietary tech) should be endorsed (even thought they may be manufactured locally under strategic partnerships) by the Indians else everything is gonna be PRC/Korea Inspired.",POSITIVE
"Initially I want to buy infinix qled t.v because of earlier experience with the brand was good moreover it was 8000 Rs economical to Toshiba but I switch over to Toshiba because of brand reputation most of the well-known brands like infinix,Motorola,Kodak,Blaupunkt, Thomson etc. used to market third party manufacturers product though I am not certain Toshiba manufacturer this t.v or it is also playing the same game but I take a bet because of goodwill and three years of warranty which no other brand is providing.I have been using the t.v for three months I have following observations about this t.v- 1-Picture quality is great (Good contrast,Punchy colours, Wide colour gamut,No screen bleeding issues,Deeper black level) can be good or at par with brands like Samsung,LG, Panasonic inferior to Sony) so there is no comparison with other brands they will fall short. 2- Toshiba's proprietary Regza chip is damm fast as well as do best upscaling moreover it's own ui makes it fast in comparison to android t.v's present in the market don't compare it's ram and rom because it can do it's work swiftly in comparision with brands having double ram and rom nodoubt because of rom storage can be issue for some. 3- Sound quality is great to me it varies person to person vocals are clear and crisp, lacking bass and surround experience is great.sound is pleasing in most of scenarios like 4k movies, webseries,games,news, loudness is sufficient for room 12×15 size of room is at par with Samsung and LG t.v's of this size. 4- settings menu is easily operable, build quality is good,great aesthetics with well built functional remote. Can be improved -. 1- Bass 2-behaves like va panel so viewing angles are not that great but not that much colour shift is seen. After one month see my video review of this t.v on my YouTube channel shobhits exact evaluation .",POSITIVE
"I've had this TV now for near 4 months. The positives are that the build quality, picture quality & sound quality are all great. The only two negatives are the OS & the lack of Filmmaker mode. So I recommend getting a FireTV device or a similar device to remedy the OS issue; the lack of Filmmaker mode means you will need to manually adjust the picture quality to give you the best viewing experience possible. Having said this the TV is still a very good buy at the price.",POSITIVE
"I purchased an Acer Super series 55 inc tv on Jan 2025 , and its very nice tv that I filter for mid-range people who look for the best Audio quality and Best Video Quality.

"I recently purchased the Acer V Pro 32-inch TV, and overall, I'm extremely satisfied with its performance. The picture quality is crisp and clear, the sound is impressive, and the smart TV features are seamless.  However, I've encountered one major issue - the Chromecast feature is not working. Despite multiple attempts to troubleshoot, I've been unable to get it to work. This is a significant drawback, as I was looking forward to casting content from my phone to the TV.  Aside from this issue, the TV has exceeded my expectations. The design is sleek, the interface is user-friendly, and the price is unbeatable.  If Acer can resolve the Chromecast issue, I'd gladly give this TV a 5-star rating. Until then, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great smart TV, but with the caveat that Chromecast may not work.  Pros:  - Excellent picture quality - Impressive sound - Seamless smart TV features - Sleek design - Affordable price  Cons:  - Chromecast feature not working",NEGATIVE
"The Acer V Pro Series 32-inch QLED HD Ready Smart Google TV is a great budget-friendly option with impressive features. Its QLED display delivers vibrant colors and sharp visuals, while the 30W Dolby Audio system provides clear, immersive sound. Powered by Google TV with Android 14, it offers a smooth interface and access to a wide range of apps.",POSITIVE
"Do not fall for the stamping of the word ""QLED"" or the ""4 years Warranty"", as it doesn't have any characteristics or quality of a QLED and anyhow that warranty of 4 years can only replace a defective product, but not improve an inferior product.  At first the TV would appear very compelling right upon installation and when the room is light up. But as you use it more often and watch different types of content on different OTT apps and under different lighting conditions, you'll come to realise how inferior this TV is .  Here's what my observations are after 72 hours of thorough usage:  1. YouTube app is unusable. Whenever you play an HDR 4K video, there is some popping and cracking sound ( like pat-pat-pat) coming from the speakers, whether the volume is at 20% or 80% or full . I have reset the TV thrice and restart it each time this popping sound comes, but barely 10 minutes after a restart/reset the sound starts coming again. Check the uploaded video.  2. The Panel is a really low quality one. Blacks seem to be non existent. The screen appears to be greyish with dark patches on the screen. Photo uploaded.  3. There is notable heavy vertical banding on bluish tint pictures. Observe the thick greenish pixelated and vertical bands on the Hotstar app's menu in the photo uploaded.  4. MEMC does nothing. In fast moving scenes there is heavy blurring around moving objects. For reference - watch the tiger fight scene in movie RRR. Moreover it's a headache watching a cricket match. The ball appears blurry and the follow through of batsmen is so choppy.  5. If you use the TV for more than 30 minutes with a couple of app switching in between, the UI starts lagging. (a)You press Netflix hotkey and it takes 10 seconds to open . (b)You tap on the volume up key, the volume bar starts increasing volume rapidly and then immediately starts decreasing on its own. (c) Moreover the menu selection bar gets cropped and stuck. A portion of the bar gets stuck on the menu page and the remaining bar continues to scroll. Photo attached .  6. Either it's a bug or the TV has no volume memory feature. Everytime you switch off the TV from the mains and turn it back on, the volume goes to 100%. You'll be startled by the blasting sound when you accidentally play anything without realising the volume is at 100%.  7. The Bluetooth Connectivity is really bad on this TV. I like to connect my Bluetooth TWS at night time so that next room family member doesn't get disturbed by the sound/music. But the sound is very choppy over Bluetooth and with the slightest of head movement, the Bluetooth connection between the TV and TWS starts to break and sound gets distorted. I use Samsung Buds PRO and they work well without any issues at 30 feet distance from my phone. So there's definitely something wrong with the Bluetooth of the TV as the Bluetooth remote of the TV also has lag and response issues.  My Advice after learning from this purchase the hard way:  1. Rather than buying an entry level QLED at 30K , go for a premium LED at that price point .  2. Never be the first to try out a budget version of a high end product category (QLED) from a tier 2 or tier 3 brand.  3. There is no possible way to make and sell a QLED at half the price of reputed brands. If a brand is selling such a product at half the price, then accept the fact that there is going to be a major compromise on Screen quality, Processor, Imaging & Graphics engine.",NEGATIVE
"Product is very good. Picture Quality is Very Good & Sound Quality is really Great! Even in very high volume, sound doesn't crack & there is good ""Bass"" & also crisp ""Treble"" in sound. There are extensive controls for Picture(like Backlight, Brightness, Contrast, Colour, Gamma...) & Sound(like Eualizer). Definitely recommended to anyone looking for high quality at a reasonable price!",POSITIVE

"Today i purchased the 50-inch Wooble QLED TV, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The picture quality is simply stunning—sharp, vibrant colors and deep contrasts make watching movies or shows a truly immersive experience. Whether it's HD or 4K content, the visuals are crisp and crystal clear, doing full justice to the QLED technology.  The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering rich, full-bodied audio that complements the visual experience. I didn't need any external speakers as the in-built sound system offers a well-balanced range of highs and lows, making it perfect for everything from action-packed films to quiet dialogues.  The design of the TV is another highlight—sleek, modern, and minimalist. It seamlessly blends into any room, and the slim bezels ensure that your focus is always on the screen. It’s a stylish addition to my living room, and the overall build quality feels premium.  Lastly, I want to commend the delivery service. The TV arrived on time, exactly as promised, in perfect condition. The packaging was secure, and the setup process was hassle-free.  Overall, Wooble has done an outstanding job with this QLED TV. For a Made-in-India brand, it competes with international brands in terms of both performance and design. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Remote buttons have poor response - after 3 to 5 press of button, it mostly responds once - the hassles to the user is enormous. However, Amazon policy does not allow replacement of only remote. Either return the product in totality or live with the problematic accessories. So, after taking out from the box and then installation taking about 4 to 5 hours, customer will have to undo all and then re-pack. What a punishment for the customer! Please surely to be carefull while buing any consumer durable from Amazon. 2. Wall mounting kit is actually a clamp to hang the TV and no tilting to change viewing angle is possible. The word ""kit"" is a misnomer. 3. Picture quality is more or less OK; colour response and contrast are poor",NEGATIVE
Nice product picture quality is good sound is good make in india product,POSITIVE
Audio quality is truly horrible 😔,NEGATIVE
Good quality nice product faster installation paisa vasul,POSITIVE
Poor Sound Quality and Picture Clarity. HD version is better this QLED version. My suggestions is not go for it. Waste of Money.,NEGATIVE

Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.  I think I am tending to increase ratings from 4 to 5 stars. Just for the REGZA Pic & Sound from Toshiba.  Good and durable Japanese brands Like Sanyo, Toshiba, Panasonic ( that bring in proprietary tech) should be endorsed (even thought they may be manufactured locally under strategic partnerships) by the Indians else everything is gonna be PRC/Korea Inspired.",POSITIVE
"Initially I want to buy infinix qled t.v because of earlier experience with the brand was good moreover it was 8000 Rs economical to Toshiba but I switch over to Toshiba because of brand reputation most of the well-known brands like infinix,Motorola,Kodak,Blaupunkt, Thomson etc. used to market third party manufacturers product though I am not certain Toshiba manufacturer this t.v or it is also playing the same game but I take a bet because of goodwill and three years of warranty which no other brand is providing.I have been using the t.v for three months I have following observations about this t.v- 1-Picture quality is great (Good contrast,Punchy colours, Wide colour gamut,No screen bleeding issues,Deeper black level) can be good or at par with brands like Samsung,LG, Panasonic inferior to Sony) so there is no comparison with other brands they will fall short. 2- Toshiba's proprietary Regza chip is damm fast as well as do best upscaling moreover it's own ui makes it fast in comparison to android t.v's present in the market don't compare it's ram and rom because it can do it's work swiftly in comparision with brands having double ram and rom nodoubt because of rom storage can be issue for some. 3- Sound quality is great to me it varies person to person vocals are clear and crisp, lacking bass and surround experience is great.sound is pleasing in most of scenarios like 4k movies, webseries,games,news, loudness is sufficient for room 12×15 size of room is at par with Samsung and LG t.v's of this size. 4- settings menu is easily operable, build quality is good,great aesthetics with well built functional remote. Can be improved -. 1- Bass 2-behaves like va panel so viewing angles are not that great but not that much colour shift is seen. After one month see my video review of this t.v on my YouTube channel shobhits exact evaluation .",POSITIVE
"I've had this TV now for near 4 months. The positives are that the build quality, picture quality & sound quality are all great. The only two negatives are the OS & the lack of Filmmaker mode. So I recommend getting a FireTV device or a similar device to remedy the OS issue; the lack of Filmmaker mode means you will need to manually adjust the picture quality to give you the best viewing experience possible. Having said this the TV is still a very good buy at the price.",POSITIVE
It has crossed my expectations in quality and setup.,POSITIVE
This is good product for those people whom tv is not smart this device has no connectionivity issue and good speed also but some time it can cause flicker issue so beware of this issue sound quality is good but screen quality is decent it is easy to install,POSITIVE
"Pathetic, it did not load even just firestic icon came and This device not even loaded connected seems they sent faulty device without check, also Amazon is worst rhey have no option to replace or fix no customercare support pathativ Amazon support blank screen,",NEGATIVE
"I'm thoroughly impressed with my Amazon Fire Stick, which arrived today. The packaging was top-notch, and I was eager to get started.  Setup took a bit longer than expected due to the numerous updates and software downloads. However, the wait was worth it – the device works flawlessly.  I've been using my smart TV to watch YouTube, but the Fire Stick has taken my viewing experience to the next level. The picture clarity and resolution are significantly better, making it a joy to watch my favorite content.  For now, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase, and I'm confident it will continue to deliver in the future. Kudos to Amazon for creating an exceptional product!  Rating: 5/5 stars",POSITIVE

Better quality for low cost. I brought this 43 inch iFFLCON TV in July-2024 for my sister. Seems to be good for the money I spent. Better quality picture and sound system. Performance so far found to be good.,POSITIVE
"This TV is sick! The quality is top-notch, and the sound is on point. No need to waste money on a soundbar. Plus, the viewing angles and picture quality are dope.",NEGATIVE

Nice looking,POSITIVE
Fantastic Clarity with a great audio,POSITIVE
I Purchased 50 Inch Television. Overall Good Television in this Budget. Sounds are Perfect and Pixels Clarity are Good. Onlything TV is slow i dont know why. Its not responding fast.,NEGATIVE
I like the TV by its Sound and Picture quality. For RAM management this tv has 2 gb ram and tv having good response time. Option to use the tv without remote either Google assistant or Google tv android app,POSITIVE
It has been maybe a month since I brought it. Working well. Some may find brightness too high. So set it to zero using the button behind the display. Happy to have recieved HDMI cable with it.,NEGATIVE
"The monitor is performing well since a week after delivery, no hardware issues were found, but the monitor is very bright and causes strain to eyes if continuously used. This is probably a flaw in controller firmware and brightness cannot be reduced via any operating system. Reducing brightness from built-in OSD menu (Buttons provided on monitor) does not help either.  If anyone faces this issue, one solution is to try out different combinations of brightness and contrast in the OSD menu. You can also try reducing the RGB color values. Most graphics drivers have brightness and color options. Overall, this monitor is not bad in the given price range.",POSITIVE
"Please don't purchase this product worst quality and worst company service, we have received a Damaged moniter and also lines are present in the screen Company customer care not responding about my complaint and amzon customer care also",NEGATIVE
"Moniter is bit old model but better in low budget color accuracy you should set as per your eyes carefully, design is good and good fitting, height is ok for people who use from less distance and brightness is enough and it's very bright but some what blur and it doesn't have inbuilt sound system",POSITIVE
Letters are blurred. Brightness control not working. Overall it is just a monitor. Can't use it for longer duration.,NEGATIVE
"Product is good and working properly, I suggest everyone to buy this product. It's sound is good , brightness size every thing is perfect, easy to install, cost is reasonable. Picture quality is good Thank you.",POSITIVE
"Okay, Good quality",POSITIVE
The stand doesn’t support the monitors weight. Worst design. Will return the product after trying out for a day or two if the build quality is this low.,NEGATIVE
"My 10 year old Sony TV had Netflix hard installed and I started getting messages from the provider that it would be no longer supported on the TV model. This was in June 24. No OTA supports from Sony or Netflix to upgrade the app.  I had to look for an alternative. I zeroed in on this. And I have no regrets.  I get Netflix, YouTube ,Amazon Prime and a host of other channels (paid and free) which have opened up a whole world of entertainment for me .  This device is not without its quirks. Sometimes the disk space runs out and I have issues updating existing apps. Sometimes the response is low.  But these issues are not deal breakers. This device is a mini computer with its own processor and memory. You have to be a borderline tecchie or a nerd to use this. I've had no issues working with it.  Bluetooth wireless beautifully and you can watch quietly without disturbing anyone.  You can even get a VPN connection, install the vpn app and watch old Hollywood movies. I wont tell you how. What's the fun in that? :-)  Picture quality and sound are great. Go for it. I've had no regrets.",POSITIVE
I purchased a Refurbished Fire tv stick with Alexa voice remote 3rd gen at a reduced price with AMZ guarantee that it is checked and as good as new. It did not work .wasted my time cannot reset it. Says Android corrupt and TV screen freezes. Waste. No customer help . Says now only replace..again !,NEGATIVE
"The Certified Refurbished Fire TV Stick HD Streaming Device with the All-New Alexa Voice Remote is an extremely popular and useful device. Here are the pros and cons of it: Offers excellent video and audio quality, enriching the viewing experience. Voice control is simple and effective. Easy access to apps like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Hotstar. Cost-effective compared to a new product as it is certified refurbished. Connect to TV and be ready to use in minutes. Disliked (disadvantages): Storage Limitations: Limited internal storage makes it difficult to download multiple apps. 🙏☺️",POSITIVE
"This product is bang for buck as it is basically a new and unused unit and the remote, cables and the firestick itself feels of good quality. The mic of remote also feels good. I ran this firestick on a chinese wisdom share tv and had issue of volume and power button button not working, this is because during the setup i had selected my tv brand name as brand not listed, but for these features to work i had to select correct tv brand name. This is because to get the correct IR code we have to specify the tv brand. Since I had chinese tv I had to select a chinese brand of tv like tcl, hisense or skyworth. If the don't work use samsung, lg or sony as tv brand and the features will work overall this is a very good product.",POSITIVE
Everything working fine easy to install .,POSITIVE
"Items received physically are as it was described. About performance, I am yet to use i t. I have not started using it so can not say about the performance, Look wise, fire stick and it's assembly look sturdy but remote looks very delicate. If standard sise (bigger) sturdy remote is supplied it will be much better.",POSITIVE
Very good product....working very well.... Attains a good speed....I m enjoying,POSITIVE
"The firestick looks just like new. Everything works except for volume control and ON/OFF. These two features, as claimed by Firestick, does not work. You still need your old TV remote to ON the TV and control the volume. The rest of the features works perfectly on time!",POSITIVE

"Toshiba TVs are known for their exceptional picture quality and impressive performance. The vibrant colors, sharp details, and smooth motion make the viewing experience truly enjoyable. Whether you're watching movies, sports, or playing games, the display quality never fails to impress. Additionally, the sound clarity and build quality reflect Toshiba's commitment to excellence. Overall, it's a great choice for anyone looking for a premium yet affordable TV. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Toshiba 55-inch TV and I must say, I am extremely impressed with the overall performance and quality of this product. The picture quality is outstanding, with vibrant colors and sharp details that make watching movies and TV shows a truly immersive experience. The sound quality is also top-notch, providing clear and crisp audio that enhances the viewing experience.  I appreciate the sleek and modern design of it ,which looks great in my living room and adds a touch of elegance to the space. The setup was quick and easy, and the user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it a breeze to navigate through different settings and apps.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. It has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, design, and features. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a high-quality viewing experience at an affordable price. Thank you, Toshiba, for delivering such a fantastic product!",POSITIVE
Giveing review after 1 month of use Pros- Overally video and audio Clearity is awesome. Value for money. Cons- In high moving object like while watching cricket observe when ball moves faster it gets blur some time it's seems 2-3 ball are moves faster back to back like that. In short MEMC not provided or not working properly. But it's not big issue,POSITIVE
"The performance of the Toshiba TV is excellent! The picture quality is vibrant, the sound is crisp, and the overall experience has been great. However, the installation process could have been better. While the setup was completed, one side of the TV is slightly tilted down, which was a bit disappointing.  Despite this minor issue, the TV itself delivers an outstanding viewing experience, and I’m very satisfied with the product. Highly recommend it for its performance!",POSITIVE
"The TV is awsome, very nice picture quality and dolby atmos is too good. At this price point you can't ask for more. Yes in comparison to all Android tv this is a bit slow but faster than the rest.  Important part- I read many negative comments or reviews regarding installation failure. The same happened with me, however with constant communication with Amazon they helped me to get the tv installed within the scheduled time. Yes if you are polite enough anyone will help you out.  There are reviews regarding the tv shutting down itself after some time. The same thing happened with me. But it's a energy saving feature of the TV, if you keep it in idle condition it will shutdown. That is a good feature. But illeterate consumers doesn't understand nor study the manual before posting such reviews. It's an awsome tv go for it",NEGATIVE
"TV is a good buy at this price point. Picture quality could have been better, sound is clear and loud. Overall a nice tv.",POSITIVE
"Positives: overall good performance, 2 years of warranty.  Negatives: White light bleeding at the edges of screen very clearly visible in grey screen.",NEGATIVE
"At this price range this is the only TV maybe which has 2 GB RAM, others come at 1 or 1.5 GB RAM. So as a Smart TV you are able to get a glitch free interface.",NEGATIVE
"I recently upgraded to the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV, and I’m quite impressed by what it delivers at its price point. Here’s my personal take:  Picture Quality:  The 4K resolution with Dolby Vision really stands out. Watching UHD content is a treat, with vibrant colors and clear details, especially in brighter scenes. However, when streaming SDR content or older shows, you might notice some graininess, especially on larger screens like the 65-inch model. Adjusting the backlight and saturation can help if you prefer more natural tones, as the default settings can be a bit too vivid for my taste.  Sound:  The 30W speakers are surprisingly good for regular TV viewing, supporting Dolby Audio and DTS. For everyday use, they’re loud and clear enough, but I found the bass to be lacking, so if you're a fan of deep, immersive sound, investing in a soundbar might be a good idea.  User Interface:  Google TV is easy to navigate, and I love how it suggests shows and movies across platforms based on my viewing habits. Plus, Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature is a great addition, giving access to over 200 live channels without extra subscriptions. Switching between apps is generally smooth, though I noticed slight lag after prolonged use, but it’s nothing that impacts the overall experience too much.  Design:  The sleek black design with thin bezels looks great in any room. I opted to mount mine on the wall, which I think suits the larger models better as they can take up a lot of space on a stand. It's not a premium build, but it’s sturdy and fits well with modern interiors.  Smoothness In terms of smoothness, the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV is decent but not flawless. The TV is powered by a quad-core A55 chipset, paired with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. For regular tasks like switching between apps, browsing, and streaming, the performance is generally smooth. However, some users have reported occasional lag, especially after prolonged use or when loading heavier apps. It's not a dealbreaker, but the experience might not be as snappy as higher-end models.  The Google TV interface is a big plus here, as it runs efficiently, with intuitive navigation and quick access to content across various platforms. Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature adds to the smoothness, with seamless integration of live TV and streaming apps into one unified experience.  For basic daily use, the smoothness is acceptable, but if you’re after a flawless, zero-lag experience, you might notice occasional slowdowns with heavy multitasking.  Final Thoughts:  Overall, the Xiaomi X Series delivers excellent value for anyone seeking a 4K TV with smart features at an affordable price. Its picture quality shines with UHD content, and the Google TV integration is intuitive. Just be prepared for some occasional performance hiccups and consider adding external speakers if audio quality is a priority for you.",POSITIVE
"Very good and colourful panel, deep blacks, moderate viewing angles. Metal back feels solid. Speaker is also lound and clear. One con is that TV sometimes get slow and ui frames caps to like 30 hz, but it is rare. Hope this issue gets solved by update. Overall if anyone wants fabulous picture quality this should be a very good option. I got the tv at 21750 during sale, so it is value for money product",POSITIVE
"I bought it in August 2024 the packaging was good damage on executive delivered the product at my doorstep and the check the product whether it was damage or not then after 2 hours MI service centre technician called me for installation and they reach to my home within 1 hour and installed the product but I have to pay it extra 500 rupees for the Wall mount because the Wall mount was not including in the box but that is okay because the Wall mount brand is also MI, functionality of the product is good picture quality is good enough features of the product is good but the space of internal storage is not enough(only 8gb,free space is about 4gb)it should be 16GB or more for internal memory, installation was very quick and we are using the TV for last 2 month for me it's a good product I got it from Amazon at rupees of 20700 and extra 500 I paid for the Wall mount so basically it was a good deal but after that the TV was sold in great Indian festival at rupees of 17700 so I missed the opportunity to buy the product at a low price of that never mind, the product connectivity is good, picture quality was very good just go for it",NEGATIVE
As i purchase this Mi A Pro tv because of new launch and affordable price. As i can see some lag in OS as well as playing any 4k content and the internet speed was slow as i connected it through Hotspot...it was taking some time to load even though my internet speed was 300mbps and the delivery guys carelessly kept this Tv flat in their vehicle but tnx there was no damage rather then everything is good worth buying and i hope they fix some bugs in next update Quick Pros* Excellent Picture Quality Excellent Sound Build quality is good Affordable Price Worth buying  Cons* ( which i faced ) Little lag in OS & 4k content Response time is little slow Stand build quality is not good,NEGATIVE
"The worst ever sound quality. Good display but with performance lag! After a week, sound became weaker than it was in the beginning! No more option to replace the TV or replace with another brand!!",NEGATIVE
Firstly The Tv Quality is good...Wall Hugging Design was the main USP ..Some People Got 2 magnets for wall mount but i got four as mentioned..All the TV Settings which are required like display settings sound settings network settings etc etc all available and OS is Good and smooth as expected.. Unnecessary apps are not there no bloatwares which i liked the most.. Motion sensor and far field mic works good...Remote is too clicky too noisy which could be better at this price otherwise good Hot keys working great..TV Sound Not good you will have to connect Soundbar for better sound quality and experience... .I am giving this Feedback after 8 days of continuous usage...You will have to set the settings after installation because the default settings does not give good picture quality... Secondly If you have soundbar and conneted with HDMI you will definitely experience a sound delay in TV which is a lot delay and you will get annoyed so don't worry you have to just set the Digital audio Delay ..Some Tvs/soundbars Will adjust the sound in 25m/s some will adjust in 50m/s some in 75 and some in 100 etc etc ..so do the settings...If you have a JBL soundbar and this Tv i will recommend you to adjust it in 100m/s.. the display quality and OS UI is Very good and as expected..I didnt have any issues in delivery...the delivery was done smoothly without any flaws...the representatives were good... Thankyou Hope this Review will help You!,POSITIVE
"This tv is really good in picture quality, it supports all forms of HDR ... colours are beautiful and can get really bright too. The speakers are also amazing very loud and clear with good base. It is a steel in this price range. Really awesome performance.",POSITIVE
Amazon will not do the premium installation as promised. I wasted my entire week following with them. Get ready to she'll out Rs. 800 to 1000 from your pocket. The TV is manufactured in 2022 and has VA panel so viewing angle are not 178 degrees. Don't ever purchase a TV from Amazon.Bad service.,NEGATIVE
"This TV commands attention with its captivating display, boasting vibrant colors and sharp contrasts that immerse you in your favorite content. However, the audio falls short, lacking the depth to match the impressive visuals. The built-in speakers deliver passable sound, but audiophiles might consider external speakers for a better experience. The operating system performance is a mixed bag, with occasional lag and system hangs that disrupt an otherwise smooth interface. While the TV shows promise, audio enhancements and more consistent OS performance are needed to fully match its visual prowess.",NEGATIVE
"I had read hundreds and thousands of Customer product review for an informed purchase decisions. Now, it is my turn to give back the honest review to community.  I had wanted a glare-free TV for my brightly lit Room, and there were only two options in the market. The other one is pricey, has only 1 year warranty so I opted for the Newly launched Acer TV 65 inch W series which has Super Anti-glare Screen and 3 year onsite comprehensive warranty.  After initial glitch in getting installing TV, finally the support and service team of Acer did a wonderful job and now I am enjoying TV in Dolby Vision & Dolby Atmos on stunning Anti-Glare screen that too with superb picture clarity & quality. Exactly as I had wanted. --- Update-  After using well above 1 week, here is my long-term use review:  Pros: 1 – Anti-glare screen. Though its screen coating is not at par with that of Samsung Frame which has Matt screen, still, there is no other TV at this price having Antiglare Screen. 2 – Display – with Dolby Vision, its display is bright and stunning.  Cons:  1 – Average Sound quality. You need a good Sound Bar or external 5.1 Audio system to enjoy this beast at its fullest. 2 – TV OS is quite slow and sluggish. Its system has 2 GB RAM and Quad core, whereas, since it is kind of ‘Flagship & high-end’ model, it must have 8 GB RAM and Octa core system.  3 - TV display is VERY bright, perfect for bright room at day time. But at night you need to adjust picture for low light. There is no Auto brightness facility. It needs one. -- Update – 2  There is issue in using Apple TV streaming device with this unit - it does not work properly with Dolby Atmos content & External Sound bar with HDMI-eARC. However, it works well with FireTV 4K stick.",NEGATIVE
Acer qled wallpaper paper design tv really value for money. Brilliant sound and picture clarity awaome.. Even I m not finding these features in latest Acer tv collection... As per my view ACER QLED W Series Top notch TV in premium segment. I don't know still why company discontinued this model.,POSITIVE
"It's been more than 10 months I bought this TV. It runs almost 12 hours everyday picture quality, performance is awesome.  TV is the device where remote performance is utmost important and I rate it minus -10⭐ for remote. It bothers you alot n you can't even operate properly.  I got the remote replaced with lot of efforts. The service is very pathetic.",NEGATIVE
"I bought this Acer Ultra HD QLED Smart Android TV for INR 50K with all the discounts and the Acer support technician installed it on our preferred time. It supports a wide variety of on-demand, OTT entertainment apps & other features that we needed and more. Even the normal TV channels look HD and if you have a good WiFi connection, the Internet based feeds stream in ultra HD mode. We have had this TV running for nearly 2 months now and haven't encountered any issues so far. Overall it's a nice TV with good product support and well worth the price tag.",POSITIVE
Nice tv picture quality is super this products are value for money,POSITIVE
"Good Sharp picture , easy setup for smart TV , sound is high on treble , better speakers could have been provided.",POSITIVE
"Top quality TVs (Sony, Samsung, LG) are about 2.5-3 times the price... cheap TV (but reputed names.. like MI, Micromax) are abt 2 times this price - this is so low price (other similar priced TVs were of unknown brands.. Kevin has made some name/presence by now), I was pretty sure it was a cheap quality dud! I thought if this TV lasted the warranty period, then its still value for money,... so i took the risk. TV arrived.. it stopped working on the same day!!!!!! inspection+replacement request registered with amazon.. smooth experience there, finally replaced.. and the new TV works perfectly. Note - the installation+warranty time servicing+repairs etc.. has been outsourced by Kevin to a third party company called Jeeves.. they're all digital, with all communications and visits etc recorded via sms-es, emails, etc... very professional. So, if tv ever gets spoilt, the toll-free experience+service/repair experience should be trouble-free. Also Note - There is an extended warranty provided at the time of purchase - for such a cheap tv, if I had 1 yr of extra warranty, then why not? But fr some reason I could not purchase the extended warranty. But at the time of installation, the Jeeves technician offered me extended warranty from them - so, i bought - 2 yrs for 1100Rs. Am glad I couldn't buy extended warranty at time of checkout.. and since Jeeves is the main entity handling repairs etc, it was better to buy from them... So now my cheap TV has a 1+2=3yr warranty! Nice!!!  TV - picture quality - OK.. does the job pretty well, the 15k-20k+Rs TV will be better.. but I don't care, at this price. The non-HD channels have slightly pixellated edges, but I noticed that if I reduced the sharpness to 0, the problem goes away. Everything else is all good - only thing is the ""whites"" seems a bit over-exposed/too bright, and if you reduce the brightness and contrast so that pure white ares of the picture looks alright, then the dark/shadowy/black areas of the picture appear too dark... you have to strike a balance(best settings worked for me at - Brightness-55, Contrast-35, Sharpness-0, Colour/Saturation-35... good balance of reducing overexposed whites and maximising dark-zone clarity), but trust me.. at this price, this is nothing, and you would have a good viewing experience. All other features - eco mode, sound, build quality etc is pretty decent.. no complaints there.  Final verdict - Go for it! super low price, pretty good viewing experience.. total value for money.. definitely go for it if your priority is getting max for your money.. if priority is quality, go for samsung, lg etc. Also, I'd suggest - skip the extended warranty and buy the same at installation time from the Jeeves technician - he may not offer it to you on his own, so ask for it.",NEGATIVE
"Here's a sample review:  *Disappointed with Post-Purchase Experience - Chargeable Installation*  *Rating: 2/5*  I purchased the vw tv from Amazon on 20 oct and received it on 24th October. The delivery was prompt, and the product seems to be in good condition.  However, my excitement was short-lived. When I contacted the installation team, I was informed that installation would be chargeable, which was not mentioned at the time of purchase. This added expense was unexpected and feels like a bait-and-switch.  *Pros:*  - Prompt delivery - Good product quality  *Cons:*  - Misleading information regarding installation costs - Additional charges for installation  *Suggestions:*  - Clearly mention installation costs (if applicable) on the product page - Provide transparent and accurate information to customers before purchase  *Recommendation:*  While the TV itself is satisfactory, the post-purchase experience has left a sour taste. Buyers, beware of potential additional costs. Amazon, please clarify installation costs upfront to avoid disappointing customers.",NEGATIVE
EXCELLENT PRODUCT WITH GOOD REASONABLE AMOUNT MY FAMILY IS VERY HAPY,POSITIVE
"I am extremely impressed with this VW TV! The picture quality is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and sharp details, making it perfect for watching movies and shows. The sound is also surprisingly good for a TV of this size, filling the room nicely without needing a soundbar. The setup was quick and easy, and the smart features work flawlessly, allowing me to stream all my favorite apps without any lag. It's a great value for the price, perfect for smaller rooms or as a second TV. Highly recommend.",POSITIVE

"I recently purchased the Acer V Pro 32-inch TV, and overall, I'm extremely satisfied with its performance. The picture quality is crisp and clear, the sound is impressive, and the smart TV features are seamless.  However, I've encountered one major issue - the Chromecast feature is not working. Despite multiple attempts to troubleshoot, I've been unable to get it to work. This is a significant drawback, as I was looking forward to casting content from my phone to the TV.  Aside from this issue, the TV has exceeded my expectations. The design is sleek, the interface is user-friendly, and the price is unbeatable.  If Acer can resolve the Chromecast issue, I'd gladly give this TV a 5-star rating. Until then, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great smart TV, but with the caveat that Chromecast may not work.  Pros:  - Excellent picture quality - Impressive sound - Seamless smart TV features - Sleek design - Affordable price  Cons:  - Chromecast feature not working",NEGATIVE
"The Acer V Pro Series 32-inch QLED HD Ready Smart Google TV is a great budget-friendly option with impressive features. Its QLED display delivers vibrant colors and sharp visuals, while the 30W Dolby Audio system provides clear, immersive sound. Powered by Google TV with Android 14, it offers a smooth interface and access to a wide range of apps.",POSITIVE
"Do not fall for the stamping of the word ""QLED"" or the ""4 years Warranty"", as it doesn't have any characteristics or quality of a QLED and anyhow that warranty of 4 years can only replace a defective product, but not improve an inferior product.  At first the TV would appear very compelling right upon installation and when the room is light up. But as you use it more often and watch different types of content on different OTT apps and under different lighting conditions, you'll come to realise how inferior this TV is .  Here's what my observations are after 72 hours of thorough usage:  1. YouTube app is unusable. Whenever you play an HDR 4K video, there is some popping and cracking sound ( like pat-pat-pat) coming from the speakers, whether the volume is at 20% or 80% or full . I have reset the TV thrice and restart it each time this popping sound comes, but barely 10 minutes after a restart/reset the sound starts coming again. Check the uploaded video.  2. The Panel is a really low quality one. Blacks seem to be non existent. The screen appears to be greyish with dark patches on the screen. Photo uploaded.  3. There is notable heavy vertical banding on bluish tint pictures. Observe the thick greenish pixelated and vertical bands on the Hotstar app's menu in the photo uploaded.  4. MEMC does nothing. In fast moving scenes there is heavy blurring around moving objects. For reference - watch the tiger fight scene in movie RRR. Moreover it's a headache watching a cricket match. The ball appears blurry and the follow through of batsmen is so choppy.  5. If you use the TV for more than 30 minutes with a couple of app switching in between, the UI starts lagging. (a)You press Netflix hotkey and it takes 10 seconds to open . (b)You tap on the volume up key, the volume bar starts increasing volume rapidly and then immediately starts decreasing on its own. (c) Moreover the menu selection bar gets cropped and stuck. A portion of the bar gets stuck on the menu page and the remaining bar continues to scroll. Photo attached .  6. Either it's a bug or the TV has no volume memory feature. Everytime you switch off the TV from the mains and turn it back on, the volume goes to 100%. You'll be startled by the blasting sound when you accidentally play anything without realising the volume is at 100%.  7. The Bluetooth Connectivity is really bad on this TV. I like to connect my Bluetooth TWS at night time so that next room family member doesn't get disturbed by the sound/music. But the sound is very choppy over Bluetooth and with the slightest of head movement, the Bluetooth connection between the TV and TWS starts to break and sound gets distorted. I use Samsung Buds PRO and they work well without any issues at 30 feet distance from my phone. So there's definitely something wrong with the Bluetooth of the TV as the Bluetooth remote of the TV also has lag and response issues.  My Advice after learning from this purchase the hard way:  1. Rather than buying an entry level QLED at 30K , go for a premium LED at that price point .  2. Never be the first to try out a budget version of a high end product category (QLED) from a tier 2 or tier 3 brand.  3. There is no possible way to make and sell a QLED at half the price of reputed brands. If a brand is selling such a product at half the price, then accept the fact that there is going to be a major compromise on Screen quality, Processor, Imaging & Graphics engine.",NEGATIVE
"Product is very good. Picture Quality is Very Good & Sound Quality is really Great! Even in very high volume, sound doesn't crack & there is good ""Bass"" & also crisp ""Treble"" in sound. There are extensive controls for Picture(like Backlight, Brightness, Contrast, Colour, Gamma...) & Sound(like Eualizer). Definitely recommended to anyone looking for high quality at a reasonable price!",POSITIVE
The product is really Good. The installation was done immediately the next day and a neat demo was given. The product quality is good and nice and it is strongly recommended to anyone who is interested to buy a quality and cost-effective smart tv. The Tv has various features. Thank you Acer for the product quality.,POSITIVE
"1. Picture quality and clarity are superb. 8/10 2. Sound quality is also amazing. 9/10 3. Supported apps and UI (OS Google) are also smooth, but sometimes it tends to get laggy. 6/10 4. Connectivity is an issue; whenever I try to pair it with my Bluetooth device, it fails. 2/10 Overall, at such a price, it's a value for money.",NEGATIVE
This tv is a good and well performed.but some times it may be stucked and doesnot respond.but overall performance is good and clarity wise and sound quality it's nice tv.worth for money,POSITIVE
"The screen is bright and does its job quite well while displaying 4k content. Speakers are of only 36wh but the output is way better for an apartment type home. Its value for money definitely acer is doing amazing in budget TV section. The processor is one con that I discovered that it can get laggy, it forcefully gets out of apps to maintain the performance but you can sometimes feel the laggyness. I'd hope acer will use better processors for next lineup of TVs. Except the processor, everything is good and the product is recommendable.",POSITIVE

"Putting this review after almost a month of usage. Picture quality and streaming quality is good. Display colour and sound also great. But lagging in performance, bluetooth remote sometimes not working, and only works through IR mode. Surfing between apps is still a bad experience. Viewing files in the pendrive is so much difficult. Even a 720p video can't be played smoothly when it's on my pendrive, but streaming a 1080p video through ott apps still works smoother. User interface is good, adjusting screen brightness, making some changes in the settings during an app usage is better than MI TVs. On an average It's good for the pricing, but it's not promising the specifications mentioned by the company, Acer should improve these things in the upcoming updates.",NEGATIVE
The acer I pro 43 inch 4k tv has very nice picture quality. There is minor lag in settings. Other then that UI is very smooth. My only problem is with the video playback from external hard disk. The inbuilt media player keep crashing while play 4k movies. some time takes too much time to load videos from hard disk and also sometimes it got stuck while fast forwarding. The issue doesn't solve with other media player. Nova player works fine in this tv but doesn't support HDR . The MX plays can play HDR videos but keeps freezing in this. (Both player works fine with my mi box 4k). I purchased this tv hoping the newer processor in this model will be more powerful but that's not the case. Or it may be it is some optimization problem. Otherwise tha picture quality is very good while playing online videos.,NEGATIVE
"Today, I received my Acer I Pro 55-inch TV, and after watching it, I want to share my review with all of you. This review will focus on my experience with the VA panel TV.  After watching multiple reviews on YouTube, I bought this TV, but I am very disappointed with those YouTubers. While they highlighted many positive aspects of the TV, they did not properly explain the limitations of the VA panel.  Here’s the issue: VA panels lose color accuracy when viewed from angles beyond 20 degrees. These panels are excellent if you’re viewing the TV directly from the front, where they provide 100% color accuracy. However, as soon as you change your viewing angle, you will notice significant color distortion. The picture begins to fade, and if your seating position changes to 30 to 40 degrees, the colors look completely washed out, and the picture loses its vibrancy.  Based on my experience, I strongly suggest that before purchasing a large-screen TV, visit a store and compare VA panels TV with IPS panels TV, especially on SD channels, which many of us watch daily. This will help you make a more informed decision.",NEGATIVE
Sound quality is good Performance can be better but its okay in this price range Colour quality is excellent,POSITIVE
Quality Onida just like old times. Best quality In its affordable range.,POSITIVE
"It is good, sound quality and display are good.",POSITIVE
"Folks, I write this review with great pain. But APATHY-laden AMAZON & Obnoxious ONIDA collaborates to mistreat a customer. Almost all smart TVs in this price range are of the same quality. One chooses to buy from a platform like Amazon for the ease of it.  But, that’s exactly what I did not get. The EASE and the PEACE OF MIND.  First of all, the delivery of Amazon in mountains regions for heavy appliances is outsourced to Delhivery and those folks have their own attitude. They won’t deliver the product even if your house is one step away from the road. I had to practically carry the TV on my own.  Now starts the real Agony from Amazon. A simple installation that should have taken 2 days, took THREE WEEKS. Yes, you read that right. It took three weeks for the installation guys to get bothered. On top of that, Amazon had the audacity to mark the installation service as COMPLETE without bothering to check what was happening.  When contacted, the lackadaisical customer service of Amazon (“Amazon’s poor customer service”) simply washed their hands off the matter an asked me to contact the brand again for installation. No apology, no attitude of customer satisfaction, no nothing. When I pushed, they were still arrogant enough to say, “Get it installed yourself, we will pay the money.”  Was it just about the money, folks? Who will make up for the mistreatment from Onida and Amazon; the APATHY FOR NOT EVEN CHECKING THE STATUS OF THE SERVICE and still MARKING IT “COMPLETE”?  Extremely poor customer service from Apathy-laden Amazon! Never buy heavy appliances from them if you live in a non-metro location.",NEGATIVE
Sound quality and speed were the negatives to this tv .. apart from its ok,NEGATIVE
"Writing this review after 5 months of use, I must say Onida is a trustworthy company. The sound experience is excellent, and the display quality is also outstanding.",POSITIVE
"There is a problem in sound always when I go to any OTT apps and switch to DTH TV there is no audio I have to restart it again and also whenever the power is gone DTH TV remote does not work I have to use both the Remotes to operate. Picture Quality is average, not User friendly, lag between apps and DTH.",NEGATIVE
"Nice picture quality, no issue in connectivity, warming, value for money, old brand but very good advance features. I am happy on purchasing the product.",POSITIVE
"Background : I was in search for a good but not pricey TV because of the following  1. My Samsung 49"" K6300 Curved TV had gone kaput in 4-5 years (DOP - Somewhere in 2017 - early 2018) 2. I was dragging my old TV with ever growing shadows accompanied with visibility issues. 3. K6300 was an eye pleasure when in good condition with amazing blacks and motion smoothness - beautiful out of the box colors.  Since a Tier 1 brand like Samsung had betrayed the trust after paying a premium , I was in the lookout of a mid range TV with up-to-date features - my check list included the following  1. Solid warranty clause with no Money extorsion policies like LG OLED post 1 year end. 2. Good sound system - Preferably with a sub-woofer. 3. Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.  I think I am tending to increase ratings from 4 to 5 stars. Just for the REGZA Pic & Sound from Toshiba.  Good and durable Japanese brands Like Sanyo, Toshiba, Panasonic ( that bring in proprietary tech) should be endorsed (even thought they may be manufactured locally under strategic partnerships) by the Indians else everything is gonna be PRC/Korea Inspired.",POSITIVE
"Initially I want to buy infinix qled t.v because of earlier experience with the brand was good moreover it was 8000 Rs economical to Toshiba but I switch over to Toshiba because of brand reputation most of the well-known brands like infinix,Motorola,Kodak,Blaupunkt, Thomson etc. used to market third party manufacturers product though I am not certain Toshiba manufacturer this t.v or it is also playing the same game but I take a bet because of goodwill and three years of warranty which no other brand is providing.I have been using the t.v for three months I have following observations about this t.v- 1-Picture quality is great (Good contrast,Punchy colours, Wide colour gamut,No screen bleeding issues,Deeper black level) can be good or at par with brands like Samsung,LG, Panasonic inferior to Sony) so there is no comparison with other brands they will fall short. 2- Toshiba's proprietary Regza chip is damm fast as well as do best upscaling moreover it's own ui makes it fast in comparison to android t.v's present in the market don't compare it's ram and rom because it can do it's work swiftly in comparision with brands having double ram and rom nodoubt because of rom storage can be issue for some. 3- Sound quality is great to me it varies person to person vocals are clear and crisp, lacking bass and surround experience is great.sound is pleasing in most of scenarios like 4k movies, webseries,games,news, loudness is sufficient for room 12×15 size of room is at par with Samsung and LG t.v's of this size. 4- settings menu is easily operable, build quality is good,great aesthetics with well built functional remote. Can be improved -. 1- Bass 2-behaves like va panel so viewing angles are not that great but not that much colour shift is seen. After one month see my video review of this t.v on my YouTube channel shobhits exact evaluation .",POSITIVE
"I've had this TV now for near 4 months. The positives are that the build quality, picture quality & sound quality are all great. The only two negatives are the OS & the lack of Filmmaker mode. So I recommend getting a FireTV device or a similar device to remedy the OS issue; the lack of Filmmaker mode means you will need to manually adjust the picture quality to give you the best viewing experience possible. Having said this the TV is still a very good buy at the price.",POSITIVE
"I purchased a Blaupunkt 40 inch TV, a week ago so I share a geniune review. Tv installation done within 24 hours of delivery of tv. I am impressed with its performance in this price range . The picture quality is excellent, with vibrant colors and sharp details that make watching movies and shows a great experience. The sound quality is very good, crisp and clear , bass is also good , no need of any sound bar. Tv has a feature of Google assistant and its work fine. Remote of tv is also classy and easy to use. The smart features of tv work smoothly, Ott apps like Netflix, YouTube, jio tv , prime video and other open without lag and work good without any hassle.  Overall, I am satisfied with this Blaupunkt TV and recommend it to buy anyone who is looking for a good budget-friendly tv.",POSITIVE
"As many of us may think it's a unknown brand, let me clear that those who r having car since 80s or 90s must have used its sound system for their car, so I was well aware of the name. Buying the Blaupunkt tv 55inch was proven a good deal and it has the perfect picture quality and a far better sound quality than other brands not only in this budget range but above price range too. The design, build quality, live colors, smooth and easy operation and of course affordable price makes it a perfect buy TV.",POSITIVE
"We have been using this TV for a appx month now, and it's been an excellent experience. The image quality is outstanding, with vibrant colors and sharp 4K clarity that makes everything look stunning. The Quantum Dot technology really enhances the visuals, especially for HDR content.  The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering rich and immersive audio without needing external speakers. The built-in features and smart interface are smooth and responsive, making navigation and streaming a breeze.  Overall, it's a great value for the price and has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a budget-friendly yet premium TV experience! We will update this review in six moth as we get more experience with its performance..",POSITIVE

"I couldn’t be happier with my decision to buy the Hisense Q6N! After spending hours researching online, this TV stood out as the clear winner in its price range. It’s packed with amazing features that truly enhance the viewing experience. The picture quality is stunning, the sound is crisp, and it handles everything I throw at it with ease.  Reviewing after using the TV for 3 months, I can confidently say it has exceeded my expectations. What sealed the deal for me was the availability of service centers nearby, giving me extra peace of mind. So far, it’s been flawless, and I’m loving every moment with it. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium experience without breaking the bank!",POSITIVE
Overall good product. Good picture quality and sound.The television is bit slow while using apps like prime.,POSITIVE
"Display quality of this TV is exzeberant, display is comparable with OLED TV, hd content and 4K content looks like real on TV, sound quality is sufficiently good enough but if you need more bass you should use sound bar. Operation speed is very good , only initially it takes some time to open then scrolling on YouTube channel and other OTT channels are fast, blue connectivity is good enough, ok Google feature and mice features in TV is really useful and user friendly. Most of the OTT apps are default available, Google TV features is good once you login with your Google account you do not have to enter password to any OTT app. Only one downside is it's energy rating is single star but for TV energy rating does not make much difference as it does not consume much energy, pls do your own research on this. Till now overall experience is very good.",POSITIVE
"I’m extremely happy with this television! The picture quality is sharp and vibrant, and the sound is surprisingly good. It was easy to set up, and the smart features work flawlessly. Delivery was quick, and the packaging was secure. Highly recommend this TV for anyone looking for quality and value!",POSITIVE
"I can't say enough good things about my new Hisense TV! From the moment I turned it on, I was amazed by the stunning picture quality. The colors are so vivid, and the sharpness makes everything look lifelike. It feels like I'm at the cinema every time I watch a movie! (sometimes better than theater [watched Kalki and compared] )  The sound quality exceeded my expectations as well. Even without a soundbar, the audio is rich, clear, and fills the room perfectly. Plus, the setup was a breeze—within minutes, I was streaming my favorite shows.  What really stands out is the user-friendly interface. It’s incredibly smooth and easy to navigate, and I love how all the popular streaming apps are already there, ready to go. Hisense has packed this TV with incredible features that rival much more expensive brands, and yet it's so affordable!  Overall, I am beyond happy with my purchase. Hisense has truly delivered an outstanding product, and I would recommend this TV to anyone in a heartbeat. It’s a fantastic choice for anyone looking for top-tier quality without breaking the bank.",POSITIVE
"Pros: The picture quality is great! The build quality is good and It looks great It supports and detects all formats even from pendrive The google os is feature reach, the screen mirroring with android and mac is lag free It's not too great performance wise, but works for me The Blacks are good not great It offers flexibility to change all the settings The PC gaming with HDMI is really smooth and it supports HDR for windows  Cons: Youtube app crashes for 4K HDR videos sometimes It struggles with ""Hey google"" hands free command, and takes too long to respond. Though google assistant with remote is a little faster  I don't turn the tv off instead keep it on stand-by, that helps to deal with slow start-up time",POSITIVE
"Hisense TVs is a solid choice for budget-conscious buyers looking for decent picture quality and smart TV features without breaking the bank. They are particularly well-suited for casual viewing and streaming, though serious gamers or videophiles might notice the absence of some high-end features.  If you're looking for a reliable, affordable TV with good performance for everyday use, Hisense is definitely worth considering.",POSITIVE

I am using this TV. It is QLed but there is lag in the middle east version. Not recommended. Better choose Samsung UHD than this. It come with Vidaa OS not Google tb.,NEGATIVE
In description its shown as Google tv. But this TV comes with Vidaa OS.,NEGATIVE
"The television seems to offer excellent value for its price, boasting impressive display and sound quality. The 2.4GHz connectivity is reliable, with no network issues reported, which is a significant plus. For those with a budget under 15,000, this TV could be a strong contender, particularly for consumers prioritizing display quality. Even at a low volume setting, the audio quality remains satisfactory, enhancing the overall experience. Such positive feedback suggests this product is highly recommendable.",POSITIVE
"I must say, you will get what you pay......  It's a decent tv, but not my type and the reason for saying this.. I already have couple of high end tv's including a 65 inch Sony Android Tv, a Samsung 3D TV.  While going through the deals, found this and I must say it was a damn good deal 18K only for 40 inch Panasonic.....you can only get local Chinese brand for this price. As review was also good, so bought this for guest room.  Delivery was pathetic... Sent via Delivery... and instead of reaching to the nearest delivery station, it keeps lying in their warehouse for 3~4 days, as those guys don't have a van/tempo to deliver this (and that's in NCR region).... Even they called me and asked... ""Sir motorcycle par bandh lau kya as gadi nahi hai"".. If I allow them to tied up it on their motorcycle and deliver it..., I said no to them, so finally on last delivery date it got delivered.  Installation was quick just in 30 mins of delivery and guy was very polite and decent.  Now starting with TV, picture quality is quite crisp n clear... Not like Sony but decent in the given price after all its 10 times difference in the price.  Bad part is the viewing angle, which is worse  Sound is quite loud.... Louder then Sony or Samsung, but missed the clarity... But that's not a challenge for me as I connected a Bluetooth Speaker.  Pros: Crisp N clear picture A+ Panel Louder sound Good customer service Japanese technology and that's visible in the built Latest Android for TV and hope to get update as well as it's a latest launch frm Panasonic 2020 model. Supports App installation and Update Tried Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar... Working fine. Much much better then MI.... (my friend bought an MI and believe me it's worse)  Cons: Very bad viewing angle, picture looks crisp n clear when you are sitting in front, but if you are viewing from side it's blurry n greenish will share image...... Not sure but seems it's have a viewing angle of 60 to 80° degree only.... Even my VU have better viewing angle if 178°  It doesn't support 5Ghz wifi and it means you need to connect it with a 2.4Ghz wifi router.. Means less speed and might impact watching online content... Although in my case I don't face any such issue, but then I have 100Mbps connection and even on 2.4 ghz it's somewhere 60Mbps +  Sound is loud, but not clear... Better to use some good quality home theater.  Low RAM size.  So overall it's a good set and worth the price, you can go for it if it's your first smart TV, just keep in mind on viewing angle.  If you already using high-end tv I suggest not to go with this, better to go with high end tv's only or even VU is better.......  As per me the only bad part is it's viewing angle.. Rest all manageable and ok for the given price.",NEGATIVE
Very Good picture quality and Sound quality. I recommend everyone to buy this product. Timely installation by technician,POSITIVE
It's really a value for money product...Good picture quality and sound quality. Panasonic is one of the leading Japanese electronics brand so that was one of the main reason went ahead with the purchase and definitely satisfied.,POSITIVE

"I recently upgraded to the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV, and I’m quite impressed by what it delivers at its price point. Here’s my personal take:  Picture Quality:  The 4K resolution with Dolby Vision really stands out. Watching UHD content is a treat, with vibrant colors and clear details, especially in brighter scenes. However, when streaming SDR content or older shows, you might notice some graininess, especially on larger screens like the 65-inch model. Adjusting the backlight and saturation can help if you prefer more natural tones, as the default settings can be a bit too vivid for my taste.  Sound:  The 30W speakers are surprisingly good for regular TV viewing, supporting Dolby Audio and DTS. For everyday use, they’re loud and clear enough, but I found the bass to be lacking, so if you're a fan of deep, immersive sound, investing in a soundbar might be a good idea.  User Interface:  Google TV is easy to navigate, and I love how it suggests shows and movies across platforms based on my viewing habits. Plus, Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature is a great addition, giving access to over 200 live channels without extra subscriptions. Switching between apps is generally smooth, though I noticed slight lag after prolonged use, but it’s nothing that impacts the overall experience too much.  Design:  The sleek black design with thin bezels looks great in any room. I opted to mount mine on the wall, which I think suits the larger models better as they can take up a lot of space on a stand. It's not a premium build, but it’s sturdy and fits well with modern interiors.  Smoothness In terms of smoothness, the Xiaomi X Series 4K UHD Google TV is decent but not flawless. The TV is powered by a quad-core A55 chipset, paired with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. For regular tasks like switching between apps, browsing, and streaming, the performance is generally smooth. However, some users have reported occasional lag, especially after prolonged use or when loading heavier apps. It's not a dealbreaker, but the experience might not be as snappy as higher-end models.  The Google TV interface is a big plus here, as it runs efficiently, with intuitive navigation and quick access to content across various platforms. Xiaomi’s PatchWall feature adds to the smoothness, with seamless integration of live TV and streaming apps into one unified experience.  For basic daily use, the smoothness is acceptable, but if you’re after a flawless, zero-lag experience, you might notice occasional slowdowns with heavy multitasking.  Final Thoughts:  Overall, the Xiaomi X Series delivers excellent value for anyone seeking a 4K TV with smart features at an affordable price. Its picture quality shines with UHD content, and the Google TV integration is intuitive. Just be prepared for some occasional performance hiccups and consider adding external speakers if audio quality is a priority for you.",POSITIVE
"Very good and colourful panel, deep blacks, moderate viewing angles. Metal back feels solid. Speaker is also lound and clear. One con is that TV sometimes get slow and ui frames caps to like 30 hz, but it is rare. Hope this issue gets solved by update. Overall if anyone wants fabulous picture quality this should be a very good option. I got the tv at 21750 during sale, so it is value for money product",POSITIVE
"I bought it in August 2024 the packaging was good damage on executive delivered the product at my doorstep and the check the product whether it was damage or not then after 2 hours MI service centre technician called me for installation and they reach to my home within 1 hour and installed the product but I have to pay it extra 500 rupees for the Wall mount because the Wall mount was not including in the box but that is okay because the Wall mount brand is also MI, functionality of the product is good picture quality is good enough features of the product is good but the space of internal storage is not enough(only 8gb,free space is about 4gb)it should be 16GB or more for internal memory, installation was very quick and we are using the TV for last 2 month for me it's a good product I got it from Amazon at rupees of 20700 and extra 500 I paid for the Wall mount so basically it was a good deal but after that the TV was sold in great Indian festival at rupees of 17700 so I missed the opportunity to buy the product at a low price of that never mind, the product connectivity is good, picture quality was very good just go for it",NEGATIVE
As i purchase this Mi A Pro tv because of new launch and affordable price. As i can see some lag in OS as well as playing any 4k content and the internet speed was slow as i connected it through Hotspot...it was taking some time to load even though my internet speed was 300mbps and the delivery guys carelessly kept this Tv flat in their vehicle but tnx there was no damage rather then everything is good worth buying and i hope they fix some bugs in next update Quick Pros* Excellent Picture Quality Excellent Sound Build quality is good Affordable Price Worth buying  Cons* ( which i faced ) Little lag in OS & 4k content Response time is little slow Stand build quality is not good,NEGATIVE
"The worst ever sound quality. Good display but with performance lag! After a week, sound became weaker than it was in the beginning! No more option to replace the TV or replace with another brand!!",NEGATIVE
"JVC TV Review – Great Value for Money!  I recently got a JVC TV, and it’s been a fantastic purchase! The picture quality is sharp and vibrant, making movies and games look great. Sound is clear and decent, though a soundbar enhances the experience. The smart features work smoothly, with easy navigation and quick access to apps. Its sleek design adds a modern touch to my space. Overall, a solid, budget-friendly TV with impressive performance.  ⭐ Rating: 4.5/5",POSITIVE
The jvc ai vision tv has the best quality and clear display . The sound quality is top notch . The system is smooth and simple. The best part is its price. I'd say go for it.,POSITIVE
It's very good decision to purchase of this product. Picture quality is awesome . Audio quality is just superb. Advanced in connectivity. Pocket friendly price.,POSITIVE
Picture and sound quality is very good.,POSITIVE
"The TV's picture quality is far below expectations, failing to meet even basic HD standards despite being marketed as QLED. The remote’s voice command and Google Assistant are non-functional, and it lacks a mute button. Despite repeated complaints, no technician has visited, and no complaint number was provided, showing a lack of transparency and accountability.",NEGATIVE
"Very good product compared to many other brands. Good sound output. 👍Good 50"" display.",POSITIVE
"Feel good and satisfied about my purchase of JVC brand QLED TV at reasonable price, Amazon's safe and prompt delivery and after-service. The picture quality is phenomenal and I really enjoyed this purchase through Amazon. I strongly recommend this brand of TV to anyone who planned to buy a TV without any hesitation.",POSITIVE
JCV 40 Inch TV is very good picture quality and sound system is also very good.,POSITIVE
"Value For Money, Picture Clarity & Sound Quality Is Really Really Awesome Really I Liked This Product Quality Of Product is No.1 Installation Is Also Very Simple Size & Design Altimate.",POSITIVE
"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE
Samsung products are good. Installation service is also good. Performance and display quality is very best. Really value for money. I bought this with the brand name.,POSITIVE
"Today i purchased the 50-inch Wooble QLED TV, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The picture quality is simply stunning—sharp, vibrant colors and deep contrasts make watching movies or shows a truly immersive experience. Whether it's HD or 4K content, the visuals are crisp and crystal clear, doing full justice to the QLED technology.  The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering rich, full-bodied audio that complements the visual experience. I didn't need any external speakers as the in-built sound system offers a well-balanced range of highs and lows, making it perfect for everything from action-packed films to quiet dialogues.  The design of the TV is another highlight—sleek, modern, and minimalist. It seamlessly blends into any room, and the slim bezels ensure that your focus is always on the screen. It’s a stylish addition to my living room, and the overall build quality feels premium.  Lastly, I want to commend the delivery service. The TV arrived on time, exactly as promised, in perfect condition. The packaging was secure, and the setup process was hassle-free.  Overall, Wooble has done an outstanding job with this QLED TV. For a Made-in-India brand, it competes with international brands in terms of both performance and design. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Remote buttons have poor response - after 3 to 5 press of button, it mostly responds once - the hassles to the user is enormous. However, Amazon policy does not allow replacement of only remote. Either return the product in totality or live with the problematic accessories. So, after taking out from the box and then installation taking about 4 to 5 hours, customer will have to undo all and then re-pack. What a punishment for the customer! Please surely to be carefull while buing any consumer durable from Amazon. 2. Wall mounting kit is actually a clamp to hang the TV and no tilting to change viewing angle is possible. The word ""kit"" is a misnomer. 3. Picture quality is more or less OK; colour response and contrast are poor",NEGATIVE
Nice product picture quality is good sound is good make in india product,POSITIVE
Audio quality is truly horrible 😔,NEGATIVE
Good quality nice product faster installation paisa vasul,POSITIVE
Poor Sound Quality and Picture Clarity. HD version is better this QLED version. My suggestions is not go for it. Waste of Money.,NEGATIVE
"Maha third class tv. I purchased this TV in oct 2024 and by mid december it has dead pixels First of all they dont have easy way of contacting AcerPure Customer Support.

"I recently purchased the Acer V Pro 32-inch TV, and overall, I'm extremely satisfied with its performance. The picture quality is crisp and clear, the sound is impressive, and the smart TV features are seamless.  However, I've encountered one major issue - the Chromecast feature is not working. Despite multiple attempts to troubleshoot, I've been unable to get it to work. This is a significant drawback, as I was looking forward to casting content from my phone to the TV.  Aside from this issue, the TV has exceeded my expectations. The design is sleek, the interface is user-friendly, and the price is unbeatable.  If Acer can resolve the Chromecast issue, I'd gladly give this TV a 5-star rating. Until then, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great smart TV, but with the caveat that Chromecast may not work.  Pros:  - Excellent picture quality - Impressive sound - Seamless smart TV features - Sleek design - Affordable price  Cons:  - Chromecast feature not working",NEGATIVE
"The Acer V Pro Series 32-inch QLED HD Ready Smart Google TV is a great budget-friendly option with impressive features.

Powered by Google TV with Android 14, it offers a smooth interface and access to a wide range of apps.",POSITIVE
"Do not fall for the stamping of the word ""QLED"" or the ""4 years Warranty"", as it doesn't have any characteristics or quality of a QLED and anyhow that warranty of 4 years can only replace a defective product, but not improve an inferior product.  At first the TV would appear very compelling right upon installation and when the room is light up. But as you use it more often and watch different types of content on different OTT apps and under different lighting conditions, you'll come to realise how inferior this TV is .  Here's what my observations are after 72 hours of thorough usage:  1. YouTube app is unusable. Whenever you play an HDR 4K video, there is some popping and cracking sound ( like pat-pat-pat) coming from the speakers, whether the volume is at 20% or 80% or full . I have reset the TV thrice and restart it each time this popping sound comes, but barely 10 minutes after a restart/reset the sound starts coming again. Check the uploaded video.  2. The Panel is a really low quality one. Blacks seem to be non existent. The screen appears to be greyish with dark patches on the screen. Photo uploaded.  3. There is notable heavy vertical banding on bluish tint pictures. Observe the thick greenish pixelated and vertical bands on the Hotstar app's menu in the photo uploaded.  4. MEMC does nothing. In fast moving scenes there is heavy blurring around moving objects. For reference - watch the tiger fight scene in movie RRR. Moreover it's a headache watching a cricket match. The ball appears blurry and the follow through of batsmen is so choppy.  5. If you use the TV for more than 30 minutes with a couple of app switching in between, the UI starts lagging. (a)You press Netflix hotkey and it takes 10 seconds to open . (b)You tap on the volume up key, the volume bar starts increasing volume rapidly and then immediately starts decreasing on its own. (c) Moreover the menu selection bar gets cropped and stuck. A portion of the bar gets stuck on the menu page and the remaining bar continues to scroll. Photo attached .  6. Either it's a bug or the TV has no volume memory feature. Everytime you switch off the TV from the mains and turn it back on, the volume goes to 100%. You'll be startled by the blasting sound when you accidentally play anything without realising the volume is at 100%.  7. The Bluetooth Connectivity is really bad on this TV. I like to connect my Bluetooth TWS at night time so that next room family member doesn't get disturbed by the sound/music. But the sound is very choppy over Bluetooth and with the slightest of head movement, the Bluetooth connection between the TV and TWS starts to break and sound gets distorted. I use Samsung Buds PRO and they work well without any issues at 30 feet distance from my phone. So there's definitely something wrong with the Bluetooth of the TV as the Bluetooth remote of the TV also has lag and response issues.  My Advice after learning from this purchase the hard way:  1. Rather than buying an entry level QLED at 30K , go for a premium LED at that price point .  2. Never be the first to try out a budget version of a high end product category (QLED) from a tier 2 or tier 3 brand.  3. There is no possible way to make and sell a QLED at half the price of reputed brands. If a brand is selling such a product at half the price, then accept the fact that there is going to be a major compromise on Screen quality, Processor, Imaging & Graphics engine.",NEGATIVE
"Product is very good. Picture Quality is Very Good & Sound Quality is really Great! Even in very high volume, sound doesn't crack & there is good ""Bass"" & also crisp ""Treble"" in sound. There are extensive controls for Picture(like Backlight, Brightness, Contrast, Colour, Gamma...) & Sound(like Eualizer). Definitely recommended to anyone looking for high quality at a reasonable price!",POSITIVE
Very Good product. Best clear vision and sound. Amazon's service is the best.,POSITIVE
"The device is below average, as is expected for this price range. Some apps like Prime Video don't even play videos, and this TVs play store does not even have access to Netflix. Which means you will need to connect a laptop or a Fire TV stick. Connecting to a laptop it has abysmal picture quality and this TV has barely any picture settings at all.  I tried this TV out thinking that it was great value for money and had some trust in the Kodak brand. However, it turns out they might be one of the worst TV brands I have ever had the displeasure of purchasing from.  The first TV I purchased reached within a day. Since I trusted Amazon, I paid in advance online, so I was eligible for open box inspection. The delivery executives brought it in the house and pulled out a TV which had a broken screen. They immediately noted this, repacked the TV and said that they would send a replacement. However, since the policy only allowed a refund, and I would have to order a replacement myself, I did so, thinking that this was just a bad coincidence. (Priced at ₹21999)  I placed my second order for the same TV. This time the price had increased by ₹2000 (priced at ₹23999), but keeping my trust in the brand, I made my purchase again. It was already beyond my budget, but I thought it would be a good purchase. This time, the TV was delivered on a Sunday, and the installation person arrived the next day to open the box (I had opted for pay on delivery due to my previous experience so no open box inspection) The installation executive while setup discovered that the WiFi toggle wasn't turning on the WiFi. I thought this was just a software issue that could be fixed with an update, so they executive left, I tried updating it, however it was already on the latest version.  Calling the customer care provided in the box, the phone was picked up by a rude executive who asked if I had warranty (for a TV that I purchased 2 days ago) and on calling another number I was promised a call from a so called technical team that never called me in the supposed 24 hours.  I will never associate the Kodak brand with anything other than incompetence after this experience.  Do not waste your money here.",NEGATIVE
I have been using it for 3months. The installation was not satisfactory but the TV is good. Everything is working as expected. Only issue I found was with the mobile screen casting not sure if I am missing any step . But overall a good TV with good 4k display and music is loud. It is actually Android 9.,POSITIVE
I like the tv…its good for the price,POSITIVE
After analysing all TVs available on Amazon within this price range and 4k resolution I ordered this wonderful piece 😀. I mostly use it as third screen for my trading set-up as well as watching YT. with its baseless design and high quality resolution I recommend everyone to purchase this if you are looking for best 4k 43 inch smart TV 📺.,POSITIVE

"I recently purchased the Hisense TV, and it has exceeded all my expectations. It’s the best TV I could find within my budget, offering a perfect combination of quality, features, and affordability.

"I've had my Hisense TV for about 3.5 months now, and it's been a solid choice for the price. The picture quality is good, with clear visuals and decent color accuracy.

Currently everything is working fine. Overall visualisation is good andColours are sharp. Good clarity. Sound quality is clear loud and decent. Dark scenes are not that impressive but can be adjust accordingly. Only concern which I am worried about is Build design and Quality. There are no side boarders covered the display. By any chance in future by heating issues or some other issues the attached glue lost its ability to stick then the situation is unpredictable. So consider this and think about it.  Overall experience is Good 👍,POSITIVE
"Everything is working fine. Colours are sharp. Good clarity. Remote response is fast. Sound is clear loud and decent. Dark scenes are not that impressive but can be adjust accordingly. Only thing which I am worried about is the construction of the screen/display. In the picture can easily see the display is not inside the frame or covered with the borders, it’s 3 side open and pasted on some kind of foam for flexibility. Only the bottom of the screen is covered with a strip. Sharing this because never see this kind of screen construction.",POSITIVE

I got the tv in offer in less price and in the price range I am satisfied with the purchase. Picture quality is superb and sound is also good. Sometimes it lags but not always. Overall good product.,POSITIVE
"Image quality is great, I was impressed by the audio options, very clear and not muffled like usually it is on this price range tv’s. Software is good and aesthetic, but it’s a bit buggy with Airplay. Recommend for the budget range.",NEGATIVE
This is not a Google TV!,NEGATIVE
"I am realistic and I don't know what I should be expecting for a 500€ TV But the backlight bleed is pretty awful around all the edges, at least it bleeds uniformly xD  I use flux (justgetflux) to protect my eyes (it's like reader mode on steroids) and skin color turns green, it does a lot of funky things that my laptop (20cm away) doesn't. Yes I am sitting 1 meter away from the TV  I had to play with the color setting and does absolutely nothing, even without the caveman mode that I use to protect my eyes, the colors are very washed, but it does the job, I was just looking for cheap screen real estate and I got it, don't expect anything else.  The 144hz is a complete scam by the way",NEGATIVE
"Amazing pictures quality. . Great experience. . I got this TV in an Amazing price of 65K in prime day sale after exchange offer,coupon code and bank offer all combines. . In this price range it's a gold deal to have this product. . Writing review after 4 months. . Picture awesome. . Sound is also good but still you need sound bar. . Doesn't hang up. . 120hz refresh rate is also good smooth pictures. .",POSITIVE
"After buying 75inch TV for 1.2 lakh all the HDMI ports alone stopped working after 7 months. Since it was in warranty they tried to repair it by changing the new main board which has the HDMI ports. But remote stopped working because Bluetooth /wifi boards was not compatible with the main board. They changed to new Bluetooth board still remote was not working. They did this 3 times. Every time it takes 2 to 3 weeks to place order for new board to arrive and customer service center were silent. I had to folowup continuously every 3 days for 4 months but whatever board they change either one only works, if HDMI port works remote doesn't work and viceverse. They kept trying again and again. Then i escalated to till CEO, requested for replacement of whole new TV from the beginning. But they kept trying to repair by changing boards again and again. Finally after 4th repair attempt also failed they agreed to replace complete TV. To my surprise they bought a refurbished TV with lots of scratches without accessories like Stand, remote etc. I refused to accept it and asked them to take back. I again escalated and asked for a brand New TV. Finally after 4 months they replaced with brand new TV. But in those 4 months i went into severe mental stress because of irresponsible behavior by service person and no response from Mi company side. What I found is that nothing is manufactured by Mi. All the components are manufactured by different companies , Mi just does the branding and sales and service. Example all the board's are from TCL , screen is from RoHS. Don't buy LED TV from Mi. Mi is good for mobiles.",NEGATIVE
I've been using this product since it was launched and today I can say that it has a laggy interface and sometimes remote doesn't response. Overall it's a good tv with some bug. Go for it you want to experience an immersive display.,POSITIVE
"Value for money, liked the seamless same day installation, 4k quality seems satisfactory. TV lags slightly for a few seconds just after restart, but that's fine.",POSITIVE
"Honestly wasn’t expecting much because of the price. It is great for this price, be it with regards to the picture quality, functionalities or sound quality. Installation though pretty straightforward, Amazon screwed up with their ‘Premium Installation’, absolutely pathetic!",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this tv and a faulty unit was delivered as from day 1 the tv had screen flickering issues. I raised this with Amazon and they arranged for brands support staff visit to check the issue during which the brand technician told me that there is mismatch in the serial number i.e the serial number of the tv delivered and the serial number in the invoice downloaded from Amazon app doesn't match. So no support was provided from brands side due to this issue.  I raised this concern as well with Amazon and it has been 10 days that i have been continuously connecting with Amazon support executives and absolutely no help is being provided. They keep on transferring calls to some specialised teams which doesn't have a resolution. After continuing on each call for almost 30-45 mins , the call some how gets disconnected and on reconnecting some new staff gets alloted to whom i have to explain the same story again. This loop continues. Being a Amazon prime customer there has been no support from Amazon's side whatsoever. This is my worst experience with Amazon till date. There is still no return / replacement being provided from Amazon' side , they are asking me to contact brand support for the same. All the problems are on Amazon's side but they are not taking any onus of the same.  And i am stuck with the faulty tv...",NEGATIVE
"I decided to purchase this TV despite mixed reviews, as my previous Xiaomi Full HD TV served me well for nearly six years without any issues. I opted for the 43"" model, and after using it for 10 days, my overall impression is mixed.  The TV isn’t bad, but be prepared to invest in external speakers for a better audio experience. I’m using a JBL 4 Bluetooth speaker connected via AUX cable, which significantly enhances the content-watching experience.  The default picture and sound modes are underwhelming, requiring considerable customization to achieve satisfactory results. A major drawback is the TV's inability to accurately handle red colors, which is disappointing regardless of the settings. Another issue is the remote, which sometimes requires a second press with a firmer touch to respond properly.  As for lag, I found that if you allow the TV to fully start up and load its processes (around 2 minutes), it runs smoothly without any performance issues.  On a positive note, the installation and service provided by Amazon were seamless and hassle-free.",NEGATIVE
Great but average quality,POSITIVE
I have been using the TV for a month or so. I am fully satisfied with the picture and sound quality. Installation was done by the company personal on the next day (best service). Build quality is good. I am having various apps installed from Google Play Store. I am very happy with my decision to purchase this TV.,POSITIVE
"So it displays colours excellently, sometimes you might find the HDR making a scene a little dark, but it's a nitpick. The audio on the other hand is a mixed bag, the vocals are not that pronounced so you might face problems while listening to podcasts/interviews and even dialogues in the movies (but that's on rare occasions). Apart from this, the TV is value for money. Go for it.",NEGATIVE
This product is a nice product. The look is very good. Picture quality is awesome. Volume quality is good. Little slow and wi-fi functions is little-bit hazardous. The technician who install the product for me is technically sound and co-operative.. I must say this is good cost-effective product to buy.,POSITIVE
We have requested to replace our product because sound of the TV was not working. Amazon has accepted our request but don't replaced the product. Don't buy this product from Amazon.,NEGATIVE
You will get 5 different sound quality and 9 different picture quality in this Product. You will find the difference one to another,POSITIVE
At this price it a nice product value for money and quality is excellent..,POSITIVE
"Quality of screen is good,sound is good till the 3 months of usage... but it has bit lag in remote to TV..... not suitable for elders in home, useful as cctv monitor and secondary screen for computer... not suits for TV in home..... but for a shorter term like 8 months pretty good after 4 months we experience full lag.",NEGATIVE

"If you're looking for a 55-inch 4K TV with excellent picture quality, a wide range of features, and a user-friendly interface at an affordable price, I highly recommend the Xiaomi Smart TV X Pro.  Here are some of the things I love about it:  The picture quality is good. The 4K resolution, HDR10+, Dolby Vision IQ, and MEMC all work together to deliver a truly immersive viewing experience. The wide viewing angles mean that you can enjoy the same great picture quality from anywhere in the room. Google TV is a great platform but its slower than LG or Samsung, with a wide range of apps and features, including hands-free Google Assistant support it good. The sound quality is not that good but with dolby content its good, especially for a TV at this price point. The price is very affordable, especially with the credit card offer and big billion discount that I was able to take advantage of. I got this @41500 Overall, I'm very happy with the Xiaomi Smart TV X Pro 55-inch. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great value for money 55-inch 4K TV.",POSITIVE
Good,POSITIVE
"I have purchased Mi TV in March and it started giving issues within a month only. I have requested services several times but my TV is still not working properly. Now today, it started giving block & white lines then suddenly, TV stopped working & nothing is visible on the screen. I will never recommend Mi TV to anyone. Its services is very worst. Their is no number to whom we can contact regarding the issue. They just say book an appointment, engineer will visit & repair and they just disconnect the call every time. I'm too much fed up and frustrated with the TV. Neither they come & repair the TV nor they replace the same. Their engineer/technician doesn't come on time and the person named Surender Pal Rajput never speak in good way. Whenever we call him, he is in a hurry to just end up the call. My hard earned money got wasted. I'll recommend to everyone NOT TO PURCHASE XIAOMI MI TV You will surely regret one day.",NEGATIVE
"All must have features included in this TV. Good picture quality, sound, user friendly interface. Don’t buy such costly TV like other brands. Because actual life of smart TV is just 4-5 years. And after that if your any tv starts trouble shooting that replace with new one. Because repairing cost is as much as high as you can buy a new tv by adding some more amount. Overall best tv in this price range.",NEGATIVE
Hi I am thinking to buy 43 inch led tv.

"Overall 4K performance is very good. Very sleek, elegant look and attractive design. Dolby vision enhance the colour, Black brightness performance is very good. Dolby Atmos/DTS sound is ok and should have enhanced the experience. Dual network, works with 5G for better internet speed. Google TV and Alexa Fire TV both function well with their assistants. Patchwall works fine to watch free live TV. Inbuilt Google Assistant mic easy to controlling TV and Chromecast inbuilt. Brilliant remote finishing and very sleek design.  It's 1 star BEE rated TV which consume more electric power. TV frequency refresh rate lags, should have improved in time frame. No wall mount free. No power adaptor.  Installation is from Amazon, they are charging high amount for wall mount comparing with MI brand. Suggest to get installation from MI brand.  Giving 4 star for installation hidden/false charges and TV frequency refresh rate.",POSITIVE

"Though fixed very tightly, the tv is tilting. The tilting angle is too much as it looks like tv is falling off. Very disappointed with the product. Again I brought a normal wall mount and fixed my tv and now it is straight and no worries.",NEGATIVE

Nice product value for money,POSITIVE
Good. Thanks,POSITIVE
"Overall a value product (75 inch) with very good quality. Happy with the sound and screen brightness. Design could have been sleeker, yet Google TV makes it worth it",POSITIVE
Writing this review after 15 days of use I got the 55inch C61b for rs 31739 effective without no cost emi discount. For that price its a steal deal!! Pros: Sound - the 35w onkyo speaker system on this tv is beast. You won’t need a soundbar if your room is below 150 sqft. The bass is good. The sound clarity is superb. No distortion even in higher volumes. Best speaker system that I have seen in a tv. Picture- its a VA qled panel The picture quality is very good Blacks are deep Colours are punchy No complaints with picture fully satisfied The google tv os is very responsive with minor lags only after booting which goes away after sometimes. Dolby vision HDR HLG HDR10+ supports are there You need to adjust few settings to avoid motion smoothening issue Gaming mode is also there  Cons The con I felt is the little backlight bleeding on edges which you won’t notice normally But visible in grey screens not in black So not a big issue Installation is very late I got call after 8th day for installation  Overall this is the best tv you can buy under 40k Go for 55 inch or above the onkyo sound is superb Will definitely recommend,POSITIVE
TCL is very good picture quality with affordable price for this QLED TV and very nice audio experience. This TV is equal of samsung and sony and LG TV picture quality.  Worth product,POSITIVE
"Its a review of the 55 inch tv!!! PROS: 1. Design: With minimum bezels, its an updated design, feels premium by the sleek edges. 2. Display: The TV supports DOLBY vision, 4k with QLED. If you are upgrading from an HD tv, you are going to be blown away by the colour output it generates. The colour contrast with deep blacks is quite amazing. I personally haven't tried game mode so cannot comment. I have tried connecting my gaming laptop in HDMI, played FC24, it feels good by the amazing 55 inches display. The tv is quite bright even in sunny daylight. Viewing angle is also good. 3. Sound: The TV comes with a 20W speaker in the back, has a good bass and is quite loud. If you are music enthusiast, you won't be impressed. Its loud and clear and satisfactory when compared to other tv's in the market. No distortion even at 100% volume. 4. Connectivity: Wifi connectivity is good. I use my 5G phone for internet connection with unlimited pack. No lagging issues at all and its a GOOGLE TV so you get maximum app support. CONS: 1. Display: If you are a sports lover, you would be disappointed. The tv has jittering issues and motion clarity isn't good when it comes to sports. High action scenes with fast movement is where the tv lags. When watching cricket, the motion clarity isn't good enough. FINAL VERDICT: I bought this 55 inch tv for 34k. In this price point, you surely won't be disappointed at all. Its the best OLED TV you can find in the market. Trust me, even SAMSUNG, LG and SONY fails when compared with price. I personally visited Relaince Digital before buying the TV online. I compared all the TV's and bought this after thorough research. Buy this tv and you wouldn't regret at all. The only CON isn't a deal breaker at all. I love watching cricket and its ok with the jittering. I am pretty satisfied with the overall experience. I recommend buying the 4k pack of OTT's like Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime. You would love the overall viewing experience of watching movies and series in this huge display.",POSITIVE
I rarely give a 5 star .. It got amazing picture quality and decent soundd quality... The tv runs pretty fast and the blacks are so deep... Good upscaling... Best under 40k for 43inches tv,POSITIVE
Product is good but installation guys were in hurry..as they are service provider also hence not raised any complaint..,NEGATIVE
After using 3 weeks i must say I chosen the best 4K TV with the price best sound best picture quality best configuration best product best 4K best colours on the TV,POSITIVE
"I bought this TV for watching in my home. I like the build and the sleek design. One Important matter I want to bring to your notice is that communication within Amazon to its customers are leaking out....... After delivery, I was informed by Amazon that the technician will come the next day (Sunday) who didn't turn up. After that, I got another intimation from Amazon stating that a new technician will come the NEXT day for installation. He did. However, in between I got an anonymous call from UK stating that they are calling from Amazon and informed me of the technician's visit and asked me to confirm by pressing 1 or 9 to cancel.....!!!! I ignored the call. This is just for your information to take up matter within so as to plug any loophole in your communication leakage.",NEGATIVE
"I haven't used an android/google TV before. If you're already a heavy youtube user, the TV is for you. The picture quality is great despite its price, it delivers great value for your money. This TV is a price - performance monster, I can honestly say.",POSITIVE
"TV was okay initially but started running slowly after a couple months. The menu scrolling lags so much and TV restarts evertime I start apps like netflix. I have kept the software up to date and done all sorts of trouble shooting with no fix. Picture and sound quality are excellent but TV is so laggy and unpredictable. I would have returned it, but window is closed.",NEGATIVE
"Our old LG tv was past it's best and with strong sunlight the picture was very dark. We looked at TCL and Hisense in Currys but they didn't really seem interested in selling us one and were trying to push expensive Samsung's onto us. We didn't want to spend that much so retired to Costa for a coffee. Whilst there I looked on Amazon and noticed the price of the 50"" TCL had dropped to £299 so went for it, the Currys price was £374 at the time.  So far it has been very good with excellent picture quality, however this is an Android tv and setting it up was a pain with not much help from the manual. Altogether it took two days messing around to get a decent setup! Android is a mobile phone operating system owned by Google, so they really push you to either log in to your Google account or set one up. I'm not the greatest fan of Google because it wants to know too much of your business but there are a few videos on YouTube (also owned by Google!) about setting it up as a standalone. On all my old tv's you scan for channels and it works, not any more so beware.  Once I'd scanned all the channels in (nearly 1000!) the picture went to a ""Home screen"" and I hadn't got a clue what to do next. Eventually by a matter of trial and error and just pushing buttons on the remote I got onto a channel list and got Freeview to work, please note there is no built in Freesat on this as there was on our old LG. The channels were all over the place with BBC at about channel 45. Lots of channels didn't work with a message saying some dongle or other wasn't installed and to be honest I was not very impressed at the end of day 1.  On day 2 I decided to re-scan the channels and noticed a few options so opted for ""Free only"". This made a big difference and the ""dongle"" channels had disappeared. The channels were all still mixed up and then I noticed the channel list was in alphabetical order, so ITV was way down the list. This was getting more and more frustrating by the minute until I found a channel organizer in the settings. This brings up the channel list again but using the remote it's possible to click on a channel which brings an option box up. One of the options is ""Move"", by clicking on this option then clicking on another channel number the first channel moves to the new position. So I was able to move BBC1 to channel 1 and then spent the next few hours moving dozens of other channels as well. There is a ""Favourites"" option but I still haven't worked that one out yet.  Is it a good tv? I would say yes but be prepared for a lot of faffing about unless you are a wizz kid geek. I still haven't worked it all out but have got it so it's watchable but even now after a few weeks I still get confused by it, mainly trying to get from the home screen onto normal channels.",NEGATIVE

"I bought it as it is a sleek model, just 1inch thickness. Use friendly OS, perfect colors. But speakers output sound is very less, you definitely need a soundbar. Sony quality is much better, similar kind of model is lil expensive and also 3 inch thick. Moreover, Sony model doesn't have eARC, which is only good thing in Samsung. BUT after 2-3 days we noticed white light / spots at the bottom of the sceen (when black background). Looks like some small bulb is in ""on"" mode when you have a black background. Technician is saying it is normal as black is very difficult to project. It is fault in TV Screen Panel only. But this kind of disturbance in watching movies is really annoying. Very disappointing....Overall, bad experience...go for SONY...",NEGATIVE

Worst item.every 6 months it's stop working.even u add Duracell aur any other batteries. Till date 3 times I replaced and 1 time purchased new remote. Amazon team needs to work on technicality of the product for sure.,NEGATIVE
Using since 10-12 months! No issue!! Functional at its best!!,NEGATIVE
"Good one .. working well Cost wise well , easy connectivity",POSITIVE
The quality is extremely bad. It doesn't work properly. You insert any battery it will work for sometime. Then it becomes inactive. Everytime you need to remove the battery & insert again to make the remote active.,NEGATIVE
I purchased firestick back in oct 2023 sale which worked great so far but remote failed somehow due to which I had to replace it under warranty. Amazon provided great support in troubleshooting and eventually replaced the remote with this which seems to be working great same as the one which came along with firestick. Purchase and contact process was hassle free and refund was initiated right after the defective remote was retuned. Thanks for such great prompt services would have been better if it was straight replacement instead of the purchase and contact and refund policy.,NEGATIVE
i change my remote 2 times. its not working properly. better try this with your mobile app,NEGATIVE
Build quality superb.voice search button works flawlessly.worth every penny.similar to the original one.,POSITIVE
"I'm really impressed with this Smart Projector! The material quality feels solid and premium.  The video quality is sharp and clear, with both auto and manual resize options that allow you to adjust the display size effortlessly. It also features an easy blur adjustment to ensure the image is crisp no matter the screen size.  Connectivity is versatile with Bluetooth, aux cable, and HDMI options, which makes it compatible with various devices. Overall, this projector offers great performance and is definitely a solid buy for anyone looking for a budget-friendly yet reliable option.",POSITIVE
"Value for Money The Portronics Beem 440 Smart LED Projector is a good value for money! At this price point, it serves its purpose well. With a 720p HD resolution, the clarity is decent—neither exceptionally great nor disappointingly bad.  Usage Experience The inbuilt apps are adequate but not exceptional. I prefer using an HDMI cable with my laptop for better clarity and refresh rate, especially for sports and action-intensive movies. This setup serves the purpose effectively.  Audio Quality The inbuilt speaker is below average. For an enhanced audio experience, I recommend using external speakers.  Build Quality and Room Suitability The build quality of the Portronics Beem 440 is good, but there is a potential issue with dust entering the lens through the exhaust vents, which requires regular maintenance. Importantly, this projector performs best in dark rooms or spaces. In a well-darkened environment, it adds a great vibe to the room, especially with a good set of external speakers.  Connectivity Unfortunately, the Bluetooth feature doesn't connect with Bluetooth speakers, which was disappointing.  Overall, the Portronics Beem 440 Smart LED Projector offers good value and functionality, but it is best suited for use in dark rooms. Be prepared for some compromises in audio quality and Bluetooth connectivity.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Portronics Beem 480 Smart projector from Amazon, and I am absolutely thrilled with its performance. The image quality is outstanding, delivering sharp and vibrant visuals that make movie nights an immersive experience. The setup was incredibly easy, and the built-in smart features allow seamless streaming from various platforms. The compact design also makes it highly portable, so I can easily carry it around for presentations or outdoor movie nights. Overall, the Portronics Beem 480 Smart is an excellent investment for anyone looking for a versatile and high-quality projector. Highly recommended! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",POSITIVE
Good brightness and decent sharpness for an LCD projector under 10K's standard. Corners are not as sharp compared to center which is expected in this price range.. App performance and screen mirroring works great.. Netflix WONT work.. Remote is decent.. Keystone works pretty well too and the product looks well put together.. Would recommend for all looking for a sub 10K projector.  Note: I have been using Lg LED DLP projector that i bought 10 years back for 52K. Had a motherboard and DMD replacement already done on it.. It costed a bomb but DLP in that price range gives exceptional picture quality.. From a VFM perspective i would recommend BEEM 470 if it would last 2 years.,POSITIVE
"Great product for the cost it offers. The ratio of screens you get, the self adjusting screen, the unboxing and usage is very simple. It could offer more brighter light for projection but I think worth the money. Inbuilt speak is decent not very loud but good enough for a crowd of 2. Wireless bluetooth enables to connect to other audio device that gives more enhanced experience. Very good product",POSITIVE
"Project Review  The product exceeds expectations in terms of quality and performance. The design is sleek, making it easy to handle and user-friendly. The resolution of the projector is outstanding, delivering clear and sharp visuals that enhance the viewing experience. Additionally, the overall build and functionality make it a great value for the price. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a reliable and efficient projector!",POSITIVE
"This is for portronics beem 450 projector. The projector is verywell constructed and nice looking, varygood britness more than enough for movie watching purpose. But there are some drawback also, 1st it's focus ability is not sufficient to get clear picture every where on the screen, if we try to clear corner than middle screen will go out focus, 2nd is its vedio card not giving 60 hz performance so frame rate compromised other wise all things are vary good, look wise and construction wise this projector is varygood and britness is also good but on focus and smoothness are not as good as it should be, also another point to note that specification says android 11 but it is not 11 but 9 and that's why I returned",NEGATIVE
The product is value for money. The quality is decent and settings are flexible. The interface and usage through remote and typing may be improved. The sound quality of the projector is good but would suggest pairing it with good speakers for best experience. It is small and portable and ease of use. 👍🏻,POSITIVE

Hope it helps to any who face same problem.  So far good. Have to see how long this remote lasts.",NEGATIVE
"Amazon doesn't sell replacement remotes for fire TV and most of them on the market are expensive. Even though it would have been great if the cost was lower, but the product lives upto the mark.

"I recently purchased the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Fame 5watts 2.0 Multi Media Speakers from Amazon, and I must say, it has been a delightful addition to my audio setup. Right from the start, the purchasing process was seamless. The order was processed efficiently, and the delivery was prompt, which is always a plus when shopping online.The speakers have a sleek and compact design that fits well in my workspace. The black finish gives them a modern look, and they blend nicely with my desktop setup.

the speaker is really good even at 20% volume it is crystal clear and loud although there is some bass and thumpy sound when volume goes over 50% but for the price it is good but one thing is that if you have your pc under the table and your speakers on top then the wire length will feel short,NEGATIVE

"These speakers are amazing, but I initially faced an issue with very low volume when connecting them to the **front audio jack and USB port** on my desktop. After some trial and error, I discovered a simple fix: connect the audio cable to the **green audio jack** on the back of your desktop and use any USB port at the back for power. The sound quality and volume improved significantly and now it’s loud and clear ! It seems the front ports on desktops often don’t provide enough power or proper audio output. If you're a desktop user experiencing this issue, try this setup—it works perfectly!",NEGATIVE

"Edit on 14th Dec 2024 : Though the switch is convenient, both input units need to be powered on, for this device to work. Means : If both input devices are plugged to this, but only one is powered on, the switch doesn't work. Need to unplug the device that is not powered on, and select the port on switch, for it to work.  But if both devices are powered on, and we need to toggle, its really just a push of a button...  Old Review - after purchase : Needed this to switch between my cable and firetv stick. Good quality product as it has a metal casing, not plastic. Simple push of a button switches effortlessly between my to connections.",NEGATIVE
This product meet my expectations. Great value for the price.,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Sounce HDMI Bi-directional Switch, and it has been an excellent addition to my home setup for multiple systems. The build quality is top-notch metallic case, with a sleek and compact design that doesn’t take up much space. The setup was effortless—just plug and play, and it worked seamlessly with my devices.  One of the standout features is its ability to switch between multiple devices with zero lag. The transitions are smooth, and the picture quality remains same I use it to connect my media server and fire stick to my monitor, and it handles everything flawlessly.  Overall, the Sounce HDMI Switch is reliable, user-friendly, and well worth the price. Highly recommended for anyone looking to streamline their entertainment system or multiple CPU attach in a single screen.",POSITIVE
"Sounce HDMI Bi-directional Switch, a simple elegant HDMI switch i purchased recently to switch my multiple desktops to one large monitor. the build quality is very good with metallic case, takes very less space and with no additional power input . Just plug and play and worked seamlessly  The transitions are smooth and no compromise the display resolution with 4k resolution. Overall device is worth for the price tag. Highly recommendable device those who use single screen for multiple devices to increase their productivity.",POSITIVE
"Nice addition to my home office setup, build quality is good, plug and play support was great and works seamlessly to switch between my source devices",POSITIVE
I absolutely adore this Product from Sounce! It has completely exceeded my expectations. The quality is exceptional. It feels incredibly durable and well-made. And It's incredibly easy to use. I was able to get started right away. It could be much better if they provide a small HDMI cable for the connectivity. But it doesn't significantly impact my overall satisfaction with the product.,POSITIVE
"This product does not have a return offered. It does not work with amazon fire tv. Do not buy, if you want to use it with fire tv stick.  The switch does not work fire tv. Unless you power off and, on the TV, and stick. But even then, the audio does not work.  On both the HDMI ports, the setup box works. Fire stick does not work with audio. It loads very slowly, if the port with firestick was selected at the time of switching on tv. But, audio does not work.  The two ports are too close, and there is not enough space to connect two devices easily. It would have been better, if the ports were in two sides.",NEGATIVE
"This accompaniment is indispensable with Fire stick as it boost up network speed to its limit. My wifi connection was located very close and it was working nicely. Yet I ordered this as ethernet is more reliable than WiFi. So, go for Amazon fire stick+ Extender both if you like uninterrupted speed.",POSITIVE
By connecting this product my buffering is reduced by 75% when earlier it was connected to wifi. If having a Wifi stability problem then you should buy this product now.,NEGATIVE
Very useful and substitute device to avoid weak WIFI signals. Resolves all your WIFI internet problems by wired connection making it smooth and uninterrupted. Costly but useful. I find it very useful for HD TV.,POSITIVE
👍🏻,NEGATIVE
"My Amazon fire tv stick is older version, this ethernet adapter is not compatible with the fire tv stick. Please make arrangement to return and refund.",NEGATIVE
Excellent product,POSITIVE
"The lan adopter is working fine. But the speed is limited to 100 Mbps [ As described in the specifications]. I run the speed test with my “Fire TV stick 4K Max” with the LAN adopter and with the WIFI. But the WIFI wins the test with more speed and streaming level. My JIO fibre broadband speed is 100mbps. The LAN adopter is streaming the 4K without any buffering. Early I purchased the same adopter, but that adopter is not allowing the 4K streaming properly. Causing above, I return the adopter and that adopter is made in China. The new one is made in Vietnam. Very important observation, if the WIFI signal is good then no need this LAN adopter. But the only big advantage is that, away from the radio transmission and stable streaming. Overall the LAN adopter is OK",POSITIVE
"Admittedly, it's my fault. I didn't read the description.  It's 10/100 ethernet standard. In 2023. This means it can hit a max speed of 100 Mbps. In 2023. I can get about 300 Mbps with my current (pretty old) wifi router. Gigabit speed should be a minimum in 2023 (if not 2.5 Gbps).  If you have wifi issues, do yourself a favour and buy another wifi access point for the same money it would cost you to buy this. Install it close to the Fire TV stick or TV. Enjoy lag-free/buffer-free experience. You will also get the additional benefit of getting better wifi signal for the other devices in your house.  I really like the Fire TV stick. But this ethernet add-on is terrible.",NEGATIVE
"The product was received in good condition. It felt smooth and silky, and I initially thought it might tear, but once I put it on the remote, it fit perfectly. My only complaints are that the tag color doesn't match the main cover (both are red, but the tag is a different shade) and that it's a bit pricey at Rs. 700 for a remote cover. However, overall, it looks good and classy, and it matches the advertised picture exactly.",POSITIVE
"Verly light weighted, fits perfectly, feels nice to touch!",POSITIVE
"✔ Fit & Compatibility: * I was initially skeptical since the product description didn't specifically mention compatibility with the BN68 remote. * However, it fits perfectly with my Samsung remote for the 50DU7660 TV. * The case aligns well with the buttons and edges, ensuring no interference in usage.  ✔ Protection & Durability: * The case provides great protection against accidental drops, scratches, and wear and tear. Except for the buttons which is open. * The material feels sturdy yet lightweight, making the remote easier to handle. * It also improves the grip, reducing the chance of slipping.  ✔ Overall Satisfaction: * I'm very satisfied with the product. * It’s a practical accessory to keep the remote in good condition for longer. * Highly recommended if you own a Samsung BN68 remote for the 50DU7660 TV model!",POSITIVE

"I recently purchased this laptop cleaning kit, and it exceeded my expectations! The spray is gentle yet effective, leaving my screen spotless without any streaks. The microfiber cloth is soft and perfect for delicate surfaces, ensuring no scratches. The duster is a great addition, easily removing dust from hard-to-reach areas like keyboard keys. This kit is a must-have for keeping your laptop clean and looking brand new. Highly recommended for anyone who values their gadgets!",POSITIVE
"The 3-in-1 cleaning kit is a versatile and efficient solution for various cleaning tasks. It includes a dusting tool, microfiber cloth, and spray bottle, all working together effectively. The dusting tool reaches tight spaces, while the microfiber cloth ensures a streak-free finish on surfaces, and the spray bottle delivers the right amount of cleaning solution. However, the cloth could have been larger for more convenience during bigger cleaning jobs. Despite this, the kit remains lightweight, easy to use, and time-saving. Overall, it's a practical option, but the small cloth leads to a 4-star rating instead of 5",POSITIVE
Quantity is sufficient in this price range according to size. Spray quality is good. It does good cleaning. Smell is also pleasing.,POSITIVE
Nice product. LCD TV screen was cleaned thoroughly. Though the brush which was included in the package was not of good quality as its bristles are breaking all the time. But the solution and the fiber cloth are genuinely good.,POSITIVE

It doesn't really upscale to 1080p as written on the product Quality lowers down a bit somewhere around 400-500 pixels but audio works fine so does the video without any choppiness or frame lag  No complaints for the price.

"If you are looking for a good USB 3 cable with micro end to support an external hard drive, etc..this is certainly a cable worth not over-looking. I ordered a Western Digital ""My Passport"" external drive to back up my music, photos, videos, etc. and though one does come with the external drive, they fail to mention that it's only a foot long. Many reviewers said that the included cable with the Passport drive was of low quality and that they had issues with it so when I ordered mine I took it a step up and got the Amazon Basics cable as a ""just in case needed"" scenario. Well turns out I am glad I got it because this cable is six feet vs. the included Western Digital USB cable being only a foot long, if even that. That may be fine for folks connecting the drive to a laptop in a portable setting, but I need a cable that is long enough to reach the drive sitting on my desk to my tower PC which sits on the floor. This cable is also thick and has gold plated ends so it appears to be of high quality. My PC is USB 2.0 only and the cable is backwards compatible and still allows for a very reasonable transfer of files (it took about 3 hrs to back up 380+ GB to my external drive with this cable, so I suppose that's pretty good). Highly recommended if you need a separate USB to micro conversion cable and don't want to spend a lot of money. Look no further, this is the one you want.",POSITIVE
"At first I thought that this was not an Amazon product because the packaging was just a jiffy bag folded over double for added protection. The lead is made of heavy gauge wire for the power transfer without significant voltage drop - beware thin cables that feel lighter: they cannot handle the higher currents required by fast-charging mobile phones and by terabyte hard drives without a significant voltage drop over their 1.8 metres length. The connectors at either end are of moulded construction with royal blue colour coded plugs indicating that they are for usb 3.0 and they are quite chunky. For most uses that makes them ideal for fast and frequent removal and connecting - they do not easily slip from your grip. Data transfers were quick and without errors even on USB 2.0 as the read and write speeds of a usb 3.0 device in usb 2.0 mode are near the theoretical limits of usb 2.0 unless there is a problem with the cable or the connection. All in all, I would say that the Amazon Basics USB 3.0 A Male to Micro B 1.8m is a winner all round, especially at the price.",NEGATIVE

"Writing after 2-3 weeks of use. The cloth as advertised is very sturdy and truly micro fibre not like other manufacturers who tell lies in the name of micro fibre cloth. Usability- I used it to clean my laptop screen, TV screen and mobile, it cleaned it very nicely and no scratches were to be seen. In my usage it couldn't clean my glasses 👓 but overall it is very usable and rightly advertised. Washability- It needs cleaning every 10-15 use and needs light cleaning, do not clean it with hard hands ✋, light machine washable.",POSITIVE
"Nice quality fiber cloth, absorbs dust and removes stains/finger prints, Apt size, lightweight, durable and easy to use.",POSITIVE
the stitching is too wide and not suitable for screens as the stich is hard and if you going to buy it for screens i would not recommend the stitches should be small and soft as you cant use this comfortably because of the stitches,NEGATIVE
I use it for cleaning my glasses and mobile phone screen. So far it has worked quite well. However I am not sure if it will start leaving lint after first wash like most microfiber cloths do. If it does not then it's the best product.,POSITIVE
It is a good product but the price can be lowered.,NEGATIVE

"I recently bought the EvoFox Elite Ops Wireless Gamepad, and it has completely transformed my gaming experience on Google TV! The setup was effortless, and the wireless connectivity is flawless, with zero lag even during intense gameplay. The controls are responsive and feel great in hand, with well-designed buttons and a comfortable grip for longer sessions.  This gamepad is incredibly versatile and works perfectly not only with games but also for navigating through apps on my TV. The battery life is impressive – I can game for hours without worrying about constant recharging. Overall, this is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to enhance their gaming experience on Android and Google TV. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
This game controller Evofox Elite Ops wired gamepad does not work or even starting initially. Looks defective in the first go when connected. Please do not order if you want to use it with game console.,NEGATIVE
It’s a decent option otherwise but disconnects quit frequently…like maybe about 4 times in couple of minutes even in 1 meter range….go for the Red-Gear one if you can as it’s the best one in connectivity…as well as performance because of those analog triggers…,POSITIVE
"Controller I have a Nvidia Shield Android TV and my remote was damaged years ago. I tried many remotes and all of them were bad. The original remote is quite expensive and I did not want to buy it.  I bought this controller as a Android TV remote. It works great and meets my requirement. Following are my notes:  Does not support voice commands. Of course. It is not meant to. Uses 2.4GHz dongle on USB. Controller needs to be charged regularly. Of course Most functions work like home button, back button, left right up down etc. Volume control does not work out of the box. There is a 3rd party tool from playstore you need to install to map the buttons. I mapped LB and RB for volume. Works great! A bit weird using as remote but u get used to it easy. Not tried using on games. But the build quality is quite good IMHO. It keep going to sleep mode after 5 mins. This is a bit annoying in case during a movie you want to change volume quickly then its a problem. You need to press the home button first to come alive and then use volume button. This is not the controller's fault. Overall I am happy using this for my use case. As a gaming device I am not too sure. I have not tried it. But the button quality is good and the overall build does not feel cheap.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the EvoFox Elite Ops Wireless Gamepad and have been quite pleased with its performance. Long gaming sessions are made comfortable by the ergonomic design, and a wide variety of game genres benefit from the superb responsive controls. Its long battery life allows for hours of gameplay on a single charge, and it was easy to plug it in and play without the need for any additional drivers. That was frustrating because I did run into some compatibility problems with certain older games. All things considered, the gamepad is a good option for both infrequent and serious players because it provides excellent value for the money. It gets four stars from me out of five.",POSITIVE
Best Quality and buttons very smooth.,POSITIVE
Kids are enjoying games..,POSITIVE
I found it used,POSITIVE
Works well and is a really good product. Very good for PC gaming.,POSITIVE
"I'm very happy, the quality is not only good but also the configuration is already setup as Xbox360 I don't need to run sny other 3rd party software like Xouput or x360ce to have it work like the original Xbox360 controller. Also the vibration is working as it is.",POSITIVE
"While the product looks like good quality, one of the main button stopped working in 10 days after I bought this Gamepad.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased an Acer Super series 55 inc tv on Jan 2025 , and its very nice tv that I filter for mid-range people who look for the best Audio quality and Best Video Quality. The Best I can say in this Tv is the Audio Quality it has an 80w Speaker and the Sound it Too good and the Base is High and it contains Dolby Atmos. and it has a wide range of audio settings. Comming to video Quality you will have a good Video Quality and a bright Screen and we have other picture settings. 1. Display : Very good Display With this Rage of Price and quality 2.Brightness: Good for Closed Room and Small room/ 3. wideangle: Dont go Exteem corner , good up to 30 degree. 4. Sound: 80w Speeker u don't need any other Speakers to attach it has decent Sound and Good . it has Dolby Atmos built-in and u will get Nice base and Loud Sound. 4. refresh rate : The refresh rate is good I did not see much lags but sometimes I feel slow, 5.memc, vrr: in real u can't see much difference but they are trying to boot the picture. 6.Dolby atmos- Dolby vision: if u are playing Vison and atmos content it will activate. 7. ports: u will get 3 HDMI pots , 2USB A ports, Ar , RJ 45 not either net  pros: tv is suitable for mid range and u will be satisfied for the money u buy best Picture quality and best Audio quality  corns view angle is slightly difficult if u go corner and slightly lag  recommendation I will recommend the tv for person who need value for money all in one have best video quality and audio quality",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Acer V Pro 32-inch TV, and overall, I'm extremely satisfied with its performance. The picture quality is crisp and clear, the sound is impressive, and the smart TV features are seamless.  However, I've encountered one major issue - the Chromecast feature is not working. Despite multiple attempts to troubleshoot, I've been unable to get it to work. This is a significant drawback, as I was looking forward to casting content from my phone to the TV.  Aside from this issue, the TV has exceeded my expectations. The design is sleek, the interface is user-friendly, and the price is unbeatable.  If Acer can resolve the Chromecast issue, I'd gladly give this TV a 5-star rating. Until then, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great smart TV, but with the caveat that Chromecast may not work.  Pros:  - Excellent picture quality - Impressive sound - Seamless smart TV features - Sleek design - Affordable price  Cons:  - Chromecast feature not working",NEGATIVE
"The Acer V Pro Series 32-inch QLED HD Ready Smart Google TV is a great budget-friendly option with impressive features. Its QLED display delivers vibrant colors and sharp visuals, while the 30W Dolby Audio system provides clear, immersive sound. Powered by Google TV with Android 14, it offers a smooth interface and access to a wide range of apps.",POSITIVE
"Do not fall for the stamping of the word ""QLED"" or the ""4 years Warranty"", as it doesn't have any characteristics or quality of a QLED and anyhow that warranty of 4 years can only replace a defective product, but not improve an inferior product.  At first the TV would appear very compelling right upon installation and when the room is light up. But as you use it more often and watch different types of content on different OTT apps and under different lighting conditions, you'll come to realise how inferior this TV is .  Here's what my observations are after 72 hours of thorough usage:  1. YouTube app is unusable. Whenever you play an HDR 4K video, there is some popping and cracking sound ( like pat-pat-pat) coming from the speakers, whether the volume is at 20% or 80% or full . I have reset the TV thrice and restart it each time this popping sound comes, but barely 10 minutes after a restart/reset the sound starts coming again. Check the uploaded video.  2. The Panel is a really low quality one. Blacks seem to be non existent. The screen appears to be greyish with dark patches on the screen. Photo uploaded.  3. There is notable heavy vertical banding on bluish tint pictures. Observe the thick greenish pixelated and vertical bands on the Hotstar app's menu in the photo uploaded.  4. MEMC does nothing. In fast moving scenes there is heavy blurring around moving objects. For reference - watch the tiger fight scene in movie RRR. Moreover it's a headache watching a cricket match. The ball appears blurry and the follow through of batsmen is so choppy.  5. If you use the TV for more than 30 minutes with a couple of app switching in between, the UI starts lagging. (a)You press Netflix hotkey and it takes 10 seconds to open . (b)You tap on the volume up key, the volume bar starts increasing volume rapidly and then immediately starts decreasing on its own. (c) Moreover the menu selection bar gets cropped and stuck. A portion of the bar gets stuck on the menu page and the remaining bar continues to scroll. Photo attached .  6. Either it's a bug or the TV has no volume memory feature. Everytime you switch off the TV from the mains and turn it back on, the volume goes to 100%. You'll be startled by the blasting sound when you accidentally play anything without realising the volume is at 100%.  7. The Bluetooth Connectivity is really bad on this TV. I like to connect my Bluetooth TWS at night time so that next room family member doesn't get disturbed by the sound/music. But the sound is very choppy over Bluetooth and with the slightest of head movement, the Bluetooth connection between the TV and TWS starts to break and sound gets distorted. I use Samsung Buds PRO and they work well without any issues at 30 feet distance from my phone. So there's definitely something wrong with the Bluetooth of the TV as the Bluetooth remote of the TV also has lag and response issues.  My Advice after learning from this purchase the hard way:  1. Rather than buying an entry level QLED at 30K , go for a premium LED at that price point .  2. Never be the first to try out a budget version of a high end product category (QLED) from a tier 2 or tier 3 brand.  3. There is no possible way to make and sell a QLED at half the price of reputed brands. If a brand is selling such a product at half the price, then accept the fact that there is going to be a major compromise on Screen quality, Processor, Imaging & Graphics engine.",NEGATIVE
"Product is very good. Picture Quality is Very Good & Sound Quality is really Great! Even in very high volume, sound doesn't crack & there is good ""Bass"" & also crisp ""Treble"" in sound. There are extensive controls for Picture(like Backlight, Brightness, Contrast, Colour, Gamma...) & Sound(like Eualizer). Definitely recommended to anyone looking for high quality at a reasonable price!",POSITIVE

"My old original firestick remote wasn't working so I ordered this. To setup we to follow first part of instructions of unpluging the power source to firestick and waiting 5 seconds before plugging back in and press to hold home button till paired notification shows up on TV. However this step didn't work for me. Instead I pressed back button+three lines button+left side of circular navigation button at same time and it paired. This is what ,the instructions on TV showed. Hope it helps to any who face same problem.  So far good. Have to see how long this remote lasts.",NEGATIVE
"Amazon doesn't sell replacement remotes for fire TV and most of them on the market are expensive. Even though it would have been great if the cost was lower, but the product lives upto the mark. Just long press the home button to pair and it's instantly detected just like the original. Check your fire stick generation before you buy to avoid incompatibility issues.",POSITIVE

Brightness levels are good and colours are fantastic and black areas are also well maintained for an IPS panel at this price. No screen bleeding issues noticed. The resolution is crisp and sharp (for the 22 inch size that I have purchased).",POSITIVE
Super good and excellent quality,POSITIVE
"This is one of the best monitor. Bezel less display looking awesome and modern. Colours are really vibrant. Assembling was easy.  IPS panel are always better than VA panels, so i extended my budget little and bought this on sale.  But there is only one HDMI port, no sound output port. Also there is only one joystick type button to control the monitor settings, i feel that the button is not sturdy. There should be separate buttons for the different options like menu, select, back, up, down.  Also one thing to mention You will not able to control the brightness level from the pc, so every time you have to adjust the brightness from the monitor with the button. This is not only with this monitor, I have asked Microsoft, they told me that external monitors doesn't support the brightness adjustment for the pc. So this is information I think i should share with you, because I suffered a lot thinking that my pc is not working. In this situation i asked Samsung and surprisingly they fixed a tech visit. I mailed them near about 1 pm on the noon, they called me to confirm the address at 3 pm and they arranged the technician visit on that same day at 6pm. I was surprised that how fast the service is, even i just asked them if i can control the brightness from the pc or not. So in my case I'm really happy with the brand after sales service aslo I want to mention that I'm not from a metro city. But luckily there is a service centre near my area. So please check which brand has service centre nearby so that will help you in future. Thank you.",NEGATIVE
"Sleek, Cozy , Easy to assemble ,optimum colour Brightness with nice Refresh rate. Highly recommended for Gaming enthusiastic.",POSITIVE
"I had an LG 27"" monitor and broke it twice while wiping with cloth.. It couldnt even take my ring figure pressure. First time I repaired it with huge cost, but second time had to throw it.. Then I bought this one, slightly smaller as I was afraid not to pay too much. LG had in-built speaker but this one does not. There is no speaker/mike. The picture quality is good. I have a Dell soundbar for audio/mic, so that is covered. The brightness is too much at 100% but I can reduce it to 40% which is good enough for me.  The monitor includes power chord and HDMI Cable. It has a nice sturdy stand. The build quality is good. The Viewing angles are also good, with no glare from room lighting. Overall the picture quality is quite good. The monitor also has eye care settings. There are couple of separate screws provided in a plastic cover, so be careful while unpacking. I had no missing screws problem.",POSITIVE
"The monitor is perfect for a laptop screen projection/extension using HDMI cable (free cable included in the box). Installation is easy with flat head screw driver. Display is great for daily office use, and the occasional video watching. What I love is the vibrant crisp display quality; brightness is really good; Color reproduction is slightly off compared to my HP ProBook laptop, but you won't notice the difference of you use it as a standalone screen. The antiglare IPS panel does an excellent job at eliminating glare from the window behind me. The joystick like controls at the back is easy to use and navigate the settings. I guess my only complaint is that the base stand has triangular legs that protrudes a lot (about 9.5 inches) to the front; this could be a problem if you don't have a big enough desk. But the monitor comes with a VESA mount support (thinking of mounting it on an arm). Overall a great purchase.",POSITIVE
"As you can see in the picture both are Samsung IPS monitors of 22inch with all same specs.  But this model is too dim and gives eye strain if you use for more than 20 mins due to low visibility of text. Also I checked with a Lux mobile app which measures the light intensity and it clearly shows the difference in their brightness values mentioned over the photo. also while bought this, had bough MSI PRO MP225 as well which at least reads 315lux in that same app and also looks much brighter than this Samsung though bit less bright than my original Samsung monitor LF22T354FHWXXL  Also Amazon has become like Flipkart now without much caring for replacing defective or poor quality products taking the responsibility and accountability and is asking me to take the new monitor to Samsung service center for having it fixed, have a look at the replacement policy snap I have posted. It was a pathetic experience and never expected this from Amazon.  Now I am stuck with this monitor and probably will have to dispose it off through OLX as it's of no use for my need which is mostly for working on productivity applications and text.  Overall Amazon has made the buyer confidence to take a plunge and next time I will think 10 times before clicking the buy button or defer the purchase if I am not sure the product will meet my need or even better visit a brick and mortar store to see it physically and buy even if it is a bit pricier there as you will not loose the entire money for buying low quality products and getting stuck with it.",NEGATIVE
"I'm really impressed with this Smart Projector! The material quality feels solid and premium.  The video quality is sharp and clear, with both auto and manual resize options that allow you to adjust the display size effortlessly. It also features an easy blur adjustment to ensure the image is crisp no matter the screen size.  Connectivity is versatile with Bluetooth, aux cable, and HDMI options, which makes it compatible with various devices. Overall, this projector offers great performance and is definitely a solid buy for anyone looking for a budget-friendly yet reliable option.",POSITIVE
"Value for Money The Portronics Beem 440 Smart LED Projector is a good value for money! At this price point, it serves its purpose well. With a 720p HD resolution, the clarity is decent—neither exceptionally great nor disappointingly bad.  Usage Experience The inbuilt apps are adequate but not exceptional. I prefer using an HDMI cable with my laptop for better clarity and refresh rate, especially for sports and action-intensive movies. This setup serves the purpose effectively.  Audio Quality The inbuilt speaker is below average. For an enhanced audio experience, I recommend using external speakers.  Build Quality and Room Suitability The build quality of the Portronics Beem 440 is good, but there is a potential issue with dust entering the lens through the exhaust vents, which requires regular maintenance. Importantly, this projector performs best in dark rooms or spaces. In a well-darkened environment, it adds a great vibe to the room, especially with a good set of external speakers.  Connectivity Unfortunately, the Bluetooth feature doesn't connect with Bluetooth speakers, which was disappointing.  Overall, the Portronics Beem 440 Smart LED Projector offers good value and functionality, but it is best suited for use in dark rooms. Be prepared for some compromises in audio quality and Bluetooth connectivity.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Portronics Beem 480 Smart projector from Amazon, and I am absolutely thrilled with its performance. The image quality is outstanding, delivering sharp and vibrant visuals that make movie nights an immersive experience. The setup was incredibly easy, and the built-in smart features allow seamless streaming from various platforms. The compact design also makes it highly portable, so I can easily carry it around for presentations or outdoor movie nights. Overall, the Portronics Beem 480 Smart is an excellent investment for anyone looking for a versatile and high-quality projector. Highly recommended! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",POSITIVE
Good brightness and decent sharpness for an LCD projector under 10K's standard. Corners are not as sharp compared to center which is expected in this price range.. App performance and screen mirroring works great.. Netflix WONT work.. Remote is decent.. Keystone works pretty well too and the product looks well put together.. Would recommend for all looking for a sub 10K projector.  Note: I have been using Lg LED DLP projector that i bought 10 years back for 52K. Had a motherboard and DMD replacement already done on it.. It costed a bomb but DLP in that price range gives exceptional picture quality.. From a VFM perspective i would recommend BEEM 470 if it would last 2 years.,POSITIVE
"Great product for the cost it offers. The ratio of screens you get, the self adjusting screen, the unboxing and usage is very simple. It could offer more brighter light for projection but I think worth the money. Inbuilt speak is decent not very loud but good enough for a crowd of 2. Wireless bluetooth enables to connect to other audio device that gives more enhanced experience. Very good product",POSITIVE
"Project Review  The product exceeds expectations in terms of quality and performance. The design is sleek, making it easy to handle and user-friendly. The resolution of the projector is outstanding, delivering clear and sharp visuals that enhance the viewing experience. Additionally, the overall build and functionality make it a great value for the price. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a reliable and efficient projector!",POSITIVE
"This is for portronics beem 450 projector. The projector is verywell constructed and nice looking, varygood britness more than enough for movie watching purpose. But there are some drawback also, 1st it's focus ability is not sufficient to get clear picture every where on the screen, if we try to clear corner than middle screen will go out focus, 2nd is its vedio card not giving 60 hz performance so frame rate compromised other wise all things are vary good, look wise and construction wise this projector is varygood and britness is also good but on focus and smoothness are not as good as it should be, also another point to note that specification says android 11 but it is not 11 but 9 and that's why I returned",NEGATIVE
The product is value for money. The quality is decent and settings are flexible. The interface and usage through remote and typing may be improved. The sound quality of the projector is good but would suggest pairing it with good speakers for best experience. It is small and portable and ease of use. 👍🏻,POSITIVE
"Value For Money, Picture Clarity & Sound Quality Is Really Really Awesome Really I Liked This Product Quality Of Product is No.1 Installation Is Also Very Simple Size & Design Altimate.",POSITIVE
"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE
Samsung products are good. Installation service is also good. Performance and display quality is very best. Really value for money. I bought this with the brand name.,POSITIVE
"I previously own a Mi 32inch 4A Pro model. I had purchased that TV as a stop-gap solution but ended up using it for almost 2 Yrs as it was quite good and satisfied all my requirements except the screen size. There wasn't a single issue with that TV during the course, so, when it came to buying a 50 inch TV I couldn't really keep Mi / Redmi out of the list. After doing a bit of research, I zeroed in on Redmi x50 and Mi 5X. Mi 5X was costing almost 10K extra and I couldn't find enough reasons to spend 10K extra for that. So, finally went with this 50inch TV during the republic day sale and I must say that this is a complete value for money.  Picture / Video: It shows any 1080p / 4K content exceptionally well. The colors are good and I didn't observe any saturation as such. Although reviewers are criticizing it for having low nits (around 250) brightness. I didn't find it that low and the brightness levels are pretty good. I think unless you have that eye for brightness, there is no issue as such. When it comes to upscaling the normal setup box non-HD content, it does Ok Ok. Not great and not terrible either. Keep your expectations lower. In my case, I subscribed to HD versions of all the channels we regularly watch, so, life is good now. Android TV experience has been great as usual. The whole SW stack is reasonably faster and does the job perfectly fine.  Audio: The speakers are good for this ""price range"". Don't expect high bass or any fancy features. All I can say is that they do a pretty good job. For anything extra, go for a soundbar. My old Mi TV had issues with Bluetooth in the sense that connecting any Bluetooth headset always has lagged in the audio. This is not the case with this TV. You can connect your high-end Bluetooth headset and watch movies without disturbing others in the house. There is no lag and everything works perfectly fine.  Overall, I would say, this is a perfect value-for-money TV with the most sought-after features. If your budget is around 30K and looking for a 50inch TV, just go for it.",POSITIVE
"I've had the Redmi 43-inch 4K Ultra HD Android Smart LED TV for two years now, and it's been a fantastic addition to my home. Here’s what I’ve experienced over this time:  Picture Quality: The 4K Ultra HD display is good. Even after two years, the picture remains sharp, and the colors are vibrant. Whether I'm watching movies, binge-watching shows the visuals are consistently stunning. It’s a pleasure to watch anything on this screen.  Sound: The built-in speakers do a pretty good job. The sound is clear and gets loud enough for a typical living room.  Smart Features: The Android TV experience is smooth and intuitive. I love how easy it is to navigate through apps, and Google Assistant integration is a handy feature I didn’t know I needed until I had it. Voice searches and commands work like a charm, making it super easy to find content or control other smart devices in my home.  Design and Build: The design of the TV is sleek and modern, with slim bezels that make it look great in my living room. The build quality is solid—after two years, it still feels sturdy, and there’s been no wear and tear, which is reassuring.  Performance: Overall, the TV’s performance has been excellent. Whether I'm switching between apps, streaming 4K content, or just watching cable, everything runs smoothly without any noticeable lag. It’s held up well over time, which is exactly what you want from a smart TV.  Value for Money: Given its performance, features, and reliability, I’d say this TV offers great value for the price. It holds its own against other more expensive brands, especially in terms of picture quality and smart features.  Final Thoughts: After two years, I’m still very happy with this purchase. The Redmi X43 has been reliable, and the viewing experience is still top-notch. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly 4K smart TV that delivers on quality and features, this is a solid choice.  Rating: 4.5/5",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Redmi 108 cm (43 inches) 4K Ultra HD Android Smart LED TV X43 and I'm extremely satisfied with my choice. Here's why:  1. Stunning 4K HDR Display: The 4K HDR 10-bit display delivers vivid and lifelike images. Whether I'm watching movies, sports, or playing games, the picture quality is top-notch.  2. Rich Sound Experience: The 20W speakers with Dolby+ DTS-HD technology provide powerful room-filling sound. It's like having a mini home theater right in my living room!  3. PatchWall with Massive Content Catalog: The PatchWall 3.0 interface offers a seamless experience with access to a wide range of content. From Netflix to Disney+ Hotstar, there's something for everyone.  4. Smooth Android TV Integration: With Google Assistant built-in, I can control my TV using voice commands. Plus, the Data Saver feature ensures efficient data usage.  5. Sleek Design: The TV's slim bezels and elegant design blend seamlessly into my home decor.  Overall, the Redmi X43 is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a feature-packed smart TV. I highly recommend it!",POSITIVE

"Today i purchased the 50-inch Wooble QLED TV, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The picture quality is simply stunning—sharp, vibrant colors and deep contrasts make watching movies or shows a truly immersive experience. Whether it's HD or 4K content, the visuals are crisp and crystal clear, doing full justice to the QLED technology.  The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering rich, full-bodied audio that complements the visual experience. I didn't need any external speakers as the in-built sound system offers a well-balanced range of highs and lows, making it perfect for everything from action-packed films to quiet dialogues.  The design of the TV is another highlight—sleek, modern, and minimalist. It seamlessly blends into any room, and the slim bezels ensure that your focus is always on the screen. It’s a stylish addition to my living room, and the overall build quality feels premium.  Lastly, I want to commend the delivery service. The TV arrived on time, exactly as promised, in perfect condition. The packaging was secure, and the setup process was hassle-free.  Overall, Wooble has done an outstanding job with this QLED TV. For a Made-in-India brand, it competes with international brands in terms of both performance and design. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Remote buttons have poor response - after 3 to 5 press of button, it mostly responds once - the hassles to the user is enormous. However, Amazon policy does not allow replacement of only remote. Either return the product in totality or live with the problematic accessories. So, after taking out from the box and then installation taking about 4 to 5 hours, customer will have to undo all and then re-pack. What a punishment for the customer! Please surely to be carefull while buing any consumer durable from Amazon. 2. Wall mounting kit is actually a clamp to hang the TV and no tilting to change viewing angle is possible. The word ""kit"" is a misnomer. 3. Picture quality is more or less OK; colour response and contrast are poor",NEGATIVE

"I have bought this TV in the month of September 2024. The screen is bright and clear and so far no issue with the connectivity of the TV. The sound quality is good. For this price, it's a good TV. The installation process was also smooth and the technician was polite and explained well.",POSITIVE
Good tv in budget. Sound is quality is very good. Picture quality is also good and clear.,POSITIVE
"Image quality and sound quality is good, easy to operate",POSITIVE
"At present the screen has several greyish colour spots on the screen. I should have checked it with a simple test : white wallpaper image or white video. I was able to confirm this issue in February-March 2023. I contacted Hisense. Their service team or whoever they have outsourced the service job to is poor. When the TV was under ""manufacturer's warranty"" this greyish issue was not resolved. But after a long time and several attempts this issue which began in February 2023 has finally been resolved in December 2023. Note that it might have been a pre-existing issue but the fact is that I noticed and was able to make sure that it was definitely an issue in February 2023. And again - to be specific - issue has not been resolved but I have been adequately compensated financially by the 3rd party insurance company. As per the service team associated with the insurance company the grey spots repair was not possible due to location, cost prohibitive, etc reasons therefore the insurance company refunded the amount (after deducting the service charges, depreciation, etc). So yes, issue has been resolved in that way which is also okay\good.  The TV screen was packed and delivered with protection using ample plastic lamination. There were 4 different protective lamination in front. There was one big lamination which covered the main screen. Then there were 2 lamination like tapes to hold this main lamination. Then there was one lamination which covered the Hisense brand name panel which is located at the bottom of the screen.  The volume control bar is 100% opaque. It is bright, white and 100% opaque and spoils the view. Moreover, when I try to change volume then this volume bar appears at the middle bottom of the screen. It is not helpful because it completely obscures the subtitles/captions and various other on screen texts/images. This volume bar is TV's system feature or perhaps it is an Android 11 feature. Location of the volume bar should be on the left or right of the screen not bottom. Else, they should have provided an option to change the transparency of the volume bar.  When this TV is about to go to standby it shows a black pop-up in the middle of the screen with the countdown timer. There is no way to cancel or snooze this timer at that moment. So it is not helpful especially if you are watching something important. TV will turn off to standby and you can't do anything about it at that moment.  The location, size, shape, etc of the mute button on the remote is not good at all. Mute button should be of a unique shape. It should be bigger than other buttons and easier to access. Button has been placed in the middle of all buttons which makes it difficult to access it conveniently/ immediately if you are watching something in dark.  I had a Sony LCD TV before. It had an excellent feature of keeping the screen off while audio was still on. It was a very helpful feature. This feature is not available in this TV.  Moreover, the Sony TV had another very useful feature which this TV doesn't have. The display area settings. There were 3 options in the display area settings in the Sony TV viz +1, 0, and -1 which were very helpful. This feature isn't available in this TV.  Options of screensaver timer are few and fixed eg 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc. I wish it was possible to set the screensaver timer of my choice eg 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, etc minutes.  In the Play Store app the installed apps often don't update even after several manual attempts let alone auto update. This is not good.  The OS is Android 11 and still there is no dark mode feature in the TV.  There should be a page up/down feature in the remote. This feature is needed quite often in various apps to browse through various genres, titles, etc. Tapping the up, down, left , right, etc keys repeatedly only to move between titles one by one requires a lot of effort and is a waste of time. It also causes hardware damage because the up, down, left, right, etc keys will wear off quickly and I'll have to buy a new remote soon.  I was focused on so many other features, prices, etc that while making a decision to buy this TV I totally forgot about confirming the energy rating before placing the order. When I placed the order nowhere was it mentioned on Amazon that it has only a 3 star energy rating. I am disappointed with this. I found out that this TV has only a 3 star energy rating after I received the delivery. The energy rating is mentioned on the sticker attached to the protective plastic lamination on the TV screen.  I had a very bad wall mount installation experience with the service company associated with this TV brand but that's a different and a long story and I guess will not be appreciated if I include that in this review.  There are several options in TV Options. One of which is the picture option. In this picture option there is a very helpful option called display mode. This display mode has 6 options. One of which is a 4:3 aspect ratio which is indeed very helpful. But unfortunately there is no option to zoom the video if you have selected this 4:3 aspect ratio. Due to which there are a lot of empty black spaces (black bars) on all 4 sides of the video. These bars or empty spaces are absolutely all right. But I also need to see the 4:3 videos in zoomed in / zoomed out mode sometimes. So an additional setting of zoom in and zoom out ""after"" selecting 4:3 display mode would have been terrific. Wish they had also included a 7th option of cinema aspect ratio ie 2.39:1 in the picture option. There is no aspect ratio above 16:9.  There are 7 modes in picture mode. If you try to change picture mode then there will be a pop-up warning saying ""this option may result in higher energy consumption"". Now amongst these 7 modes there is an ENERGY SAVING mode also. It is surprising that when you try to select this mode the same pop-up warning appears. This is contradictory. How can selecting energy saving mode result in higher energy consumption?  The home screen interface is not easy to use. The selected item or title should be prominent or conspicuous e.g. the selected item should be surrounded by a white / coloured outline so that it is easy to decipher which item is currently under selection. At present the selected item just gets a little bigger which is often difficult to distinguish from other items.  There is no option to download movies, shows, etc in any app unlike mobile phones, tablets, etc. There is no download option at all even in major apps such as Netflix, Amazon prime video, YouTube etc to watch something when offline. This is unexpected and disappointing.  I have a Bluetooth version 4.2 headphones. I could not find the Bluetooth version of the TV mentioned anywhere in the TV. I could not find the Bluetooth version of the tablet mentioned anywhere in the tablet either. The only info available in the tablet is that the Bluetooth AVRCP version is 1.4. The Bluetooth version of the tablet is probably 4.2 as per the information available on the tablet company / brand website. So anyway, I have already paired the headphones with this TV and the tablet. I usually connect headphones either with the tablet or this TV. Now if the headphones are already connected with the tablet and not with TV and then if I disconnect the headphones from the tablet (by switching off the Bluetooth of the tablet) then the headphones should automatically connect with TV. But that doesn't happen. I have to reboot the headphones so that it can automatically connect to TV.  While watching the new The Invisible Man movie (most probably on Netflix app) the visual experience was not good. The movie features a lot of greyish / dark / night scenes. These scenes looked blurry / unclear as if some sort of fog or vapour was floating on the screen. It appears that this TV is not very efficient in displaying true deep darkness in these types of scenes.  Remote often doesn't work efficiently or effectively when casting or screen mirroring e.g. it takes several attempts / pressing the up, down, left right, etc keys of the remote control before the progress bar appears on the TV screen. Progress bar is a basic necessity nowadays so that one could fast forward or fast backward a video.  If I am not mistaken, nowhere on the product page on Amazon or the TV package is mentioned that a wall mount bracket set will be provided. Moreover, there is no mention of the list of all the parts in the wall bracket set pack. There were 8 items in total. Or 1+2+2+2+2+3+3+4=19 individual pieces in total if you count the number of pieces in each item. Or 1+2+2+2+2+3+15+4=31 individual parts in total if you count every part of each piece e.g. each expansive bolt is made up of 5 parts. They should have mentioned this list on the box or on a paper or manual or somewhere appropriate.  I don't know why these brands don't recommend or provide a screen cleaning kit.  You can switch between wall hanging and tabletop mode yourself. You just need to attach the 2 tripod stands using regular screwdrivers. Screws and stands are provided with the TV. But table top stand mode is not satisfactory because it is unstable even on smooth straight surfaces.. TV wobbles when it is on the two tripod stands which- needless to mention - is precarious.  I have paired this TVs Bluetooth with my Moto g04 Android 14 smartphone Bluetooth several times. I wanted to use smartphone as remote control. But this TV keeps disappearing from the phone's Bluetooth list. Hisense support says TV won't pair with phone. Phone support says talk to Hisense.  Conclusion : Not satisfactory. Therefore - overall - after considering everything I rate this TV 2⭐ or 4/10. Since submitting 2.5 STARS is not possible here on Amazon therefore i have no option but to rate it 2 stars. I find it very difficult to rate it 3 stars because to me 3 stars stand for a faultless but good (or average) product (or service).",NEGATIVE
"The product is good built and picture quality is good. 4K videos played nicely. Sound output is also very nice Installation support was good, folks came on time and installed without any issues",POSITIVE
"Good quality TV. Well built and stylish. Good brightness and contrast especially considering the price. No lag noticed while viewing regular TV programs or cricket. Viewing OTT from Amazon prime, Disney etc is a breeze. Android boot up is a bit slow as compared to high end brands like Sony and Samsung but no problems once it is up and running. Best value proposition and having all the features as per latest technology. Excellent picture and sound quality . If you are looking for a premium TV at the very best price, then go for it without a secondary thought  NATWAR SINGH",POSITIVE

"If you are looking for a good USB 3 cable with micro end to support an external hard drive, etc..this is certainly a cable worth not over-looking. I ordered a Western Digital ""My Passport"" external drive to back up my music, photos, videos, etc. and though one does come with the external drive, they fail to mention that it's only a foot long. Many reviewers said that the included cable with the Passport drive was of low quality and that they had issues with it so when I ordered mine I took it a step up and got the Amazon Basics cable as a ""just in case needed"" scenario. Well turns out I am glad I got it because this cable is six feet vs. the included Western Digital USB cable being only a foot long, if even that. That may be fine for folks connecting the drive to a laptop in a portable setting, but I need a cable that is long enough to reach the drive sitting on my desk to my tower PC which sits on the floor. This cable is also thick and has gold plated ends so it appears to be of high quality. My PC is USB 2.0 only and the cable is backwards compatible and still allows for a very reasonable transfer of files (it took about 3 hrs to back up 380+ GB to my external drive with this cable, so I suppose that's pretty good). Highly recommended if you need a separate USB to micro conversion cable and don't want to spend a lot of money. Look no further, this is the one you want.",POSITIVE
"At first I thought that this was not an Amazon product because the packaging was just a jiffy bag folded over double for added protection. The lead is made of heavy gauge wire for the power transfer without significant voltage drop - beware thin cables that feel lighter: they cannot handle the higher currents required by fast-charging mobile phones and by terabyte hard drives without a significant voltage drop over their 1.8 metres length. The connectors at either end are of moulded construction with royal blue colour coded plugs indicating that they are for usb 3.0 and they are quite chunky. For most uses that makes them ideal for fast and frequent removal and connecting - they do not easily slip from your grip. Data transfers were quick and without errors even on USB 2.0 as the read and write speeds of a usb 3.0 device in usb 2.0 mode are near the theoretical limits of usb 2.0 unless there is a problem with the cable or the connection. All in all, I would say that the Amazon Basics USB 3.0 A Male to Micro B 1.8m is a winner all round, especially at the price.",NEGATIVE
Excellent,POSITIVE
"This accompaniment is indispensable with Fire stick as it boost up network speed to its limit. My wifi connection was located very close and it was working nicely. Yet I ordered this as ethernet is more reliable than WiFi. So, go for Amazon fire stick+ Extender both if you like uninterrupted speed.",POSITIVE
By connecting this product my buffering is reduced by 75% when earlier it was connected to wifi. If having a Wifi stability problem then you should buy this product now.,NEGATIVE
Very useful and substitute device to avoid weak WIFI signals. Resolves all your WIFI internet problems by wired connection making it smooth and uninterrupted. Costly but useful. I find it very useful for HD TV.,POSITIVE

"My Amazon fire tv stick is older version, this ethernet adapter is not compatible with the fire tv stick. Please make arrangement to return and refund.",NEGATIVE
Excellent product,POSITIVE
"The lan adopter is working fine. But the speed is limited to 100 Mbps [ As described in the specifications]. I run the speed test with my “Fire TV stick 4K Max” with the LAN adopter and with the WIFI. But the WIFI wins the test with more speed and streaming level. My JIO fibre broadband speed is 100mbps. The LAN adopter is streaming the 4K without any buffering. Early I purchased the same adopter, but that adopter is not allowing the 4K streaming properly. Causing above, I return the adopter and that adopter is made in China. The new one is made in Vietnam. Very important observation, if the WIFI signal is good then no need this LAN adopter. But the only big advantage is that, away from the radio transmission and stable streaming. Overall the LAN adopter is OK",POSITIVE
"Admittedly, it's my fault. I didn't read the description.  It's 10/100 ethernet standard. In 2023. This means it can hit a max speed of 100 Mbps. In 2023. I can get about 300 Mbps with my current (pretty old) wifi router. Gigabit speed should be a minimum in 2023 (if not 2.5 Gbps).  If you have wifi issues, do yourself a favour and buy another wifi access point for the same money it would cost you to buy this. Install it close to the Fire TV stick or TV. Enjoy lag-free/buffer-free experience. You will also get the additional benefit of getting better wifi signal for the other devices in your house.  I really like the Fire TV stick. But this ethernet add-on is terrible.",NEGATIVE
"If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.  Connectivity & Ease of Use:  Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.  Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:  Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.  That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.  Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:  Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.  Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:  I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.  Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:  Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.  App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:  Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.  Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.  Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:  Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. It’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.  If you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering. It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.",POSITIVE
"There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.  The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating. Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.  You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.  The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.  As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like. If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.  That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.  The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.  They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option. The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.",NEGATIVE
"Nice product no damage Battery backup is good single charge is up to 1 week I like magnetic ON OFF system it's really simplefied the on off method and easy to operate They giving 3 fitted sizes to your ears S,M,L Fast connectivity with mobile Perfectly fitted to ears Perfect functionality Finally value for money product from 1 Plus brand",POSITIVE
"I love these headphones! They used to be my daily until I started wearing a bud type one, but I still wear these at night. I listen to books or podcasts as I fall asleep and I don't lose them because they're around my neck (and no, I haven't even felt like I have been at risk to be strangled! Haha) they are comfortable and great sounding, and love that the magnetic closure stops the music. They're easy to connect to other devices and turn on and off. I've now bought 3 pairs (because I sleep in them, the cord gets shorted out)but I'm sure if I didn't they'd have lasted me even longer. Hope I never have to find another pair of headphones like this!",POSITIVE
"Bought these for the 2-3 hours a week I am at the gym and the battery life is good. The fit is good and the design is nice in my opinion, very slim and light weight. Despite the magnetic connection of the earbuds being the only way to power down the device this has not been an issue, they snap together and power down flawlessly. They are comfortable and the connection is the fastest I've ever seen and they connect to my S24 within a few seconds after separating the magnetic backs of the earbuds. Sound quality is decent, but the price and functionality has surpassed expectations as I've been using them for over 5 months and I've only had to charge them maybe once every other week for like 30 minutes.",POSITIVE
"Good quality, little bigger the end of the neck band because of a bigger battery. Sound and noise cancelation better than previous model. Ear tips smaller and lighter, for me hold really good even running, better bass and treble.",POSITIVE
"Nice earphones, my third set of wireless buds and this version has more bass. Battery lasts along time and very quick to charge. I wear these more than my xm5's",POSITIVE
According to the price the product was good,POSITIVE
"Value For Money, Picture Clarity & Sound Quality Is Really Really Awesome Really I Liked This Product Quality Of Product is No.1 Installation Is Also Very Simple Size & Design Altimate.",POSITIVE
"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE
Samsung products are good. Installation service is also good. Performance and display quality is very best. Really value for money. I bought this with the brand name.,POSITIVE
"I previously own a Mi 32inch 4A Pro model. I had purchased that TV as a stop-gap solution but ended up using it for almost 2 Yrs as it was quite good and satisfied all my requirements except the screen size. There wasn't a single issue with that TV during the course, so, when it came to buying a 50 inch TV I couldn't really keep Mi / Redmi out of the list. After doing a bit of research, I zeroed in on Redmi x50 and Mi 5X. Mi 5X was costing almost 10K extra and I couldn't find enough reasons to spend 10K extra for that. So, finally went with this 50inch TV during the republic day sale and I must say that this is a complete value for money.  Picture / Video: It shows any 1080p / 4K content exceptionally well. The colors are good and I didn't observe any saturation as such. Although reviewers are criticizing it for having low nits (around 250) brightness. I didn't find it that low and the brightness levels are pretty good. I think unless you have that eye for brightness, there is no issue as such. When it comes to upscaling the normal setup box non-HD content, it does Ok Ok. Not great and not terrible either. Keep your expectations lower. In my case, I subscribed to HD versions of all the channels we regularly watch, so, life is good now. Android TV experience has been great as usual. The whole SW stack is reasonably faster and does the job perfectly fine.  Audio: The speakers are good for this ""price range"". Don't expect high bass or any fancy features. All I can say is that they do a pretty good job. For anything extra, go for a soundbar. My old Mi TV had issues with Bluetooth in the sense that connecting any Bluetooth headset always has lagged in the audio. This is not the case with this TV. You can connect your high-end Bluetooth headset and watch movies without disturbing others in the house. There is no lag and everything works perfectly fine.  Overall, I would say, this is a perfect value-for-money TV with the most sought-after features. If your budget is around 30K and looking for a 50inch TV, just go for it.",POSITIVE
"I've had the Redmi 43-inch 4K Ultra HD Android Smart LED TV for two years now, and it's been a fantastic addition to my home. Here’s what I’ve experienced over this time:  Picture Quality: The 4K Ultra HD display is good. Even after two years, the picture remains sharp, and the colors are vibrant. Whether I'm watching movies, binge-watching shows the visuals are consistently stunning. It’s a pleasure to watch anything on this screen.  Sound: The built-in speakers do a pretty good job. The sound is clear and gets loud enough for a typical living room.  Smart Features: The Android TV experience is smooth and intuitive. I love how easy it is to navigate through apps, and Google Assistant integration is a handy feature I didn’t know I needed until I had it. Voice searches and commands work like a charm, making it super easy to find content or control other smart devices in my home.  Design and Build: The design of the TV is sleek and modern, with slim bezels that make it look great in my living room. The build quality is solid—after two years, it still feels sturdy, and there’s been no wear and tear, which is reassuring.  Performance: Overall, the TV’s performance has been excellent. Whether I'm switching between apps, streaming 4K content, or just watching cable, everything runs smoothly without any noticeable lag. It’s held up well over time, which is exactly what you want from a smart TV.  Value for Money: Given its performance, features, and reliability, I’d say this TV offers great value for the price. It holds its own against other more expensive brands, especially in terms of picture quality and smart features.  Final Thoughts: After two years, I’m still very happy with this purchase. The Redmi X43 has been reliable, and the viewing experience is still top-notch. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly 4K smart TV that delivers on quality and features, this is a solid choice.  Rating: 4.5/5",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Redmi 108 cm (43 inches) 4K Ultra HD Android Smart LED TV X43 and I'm extremely satisfied with my choice. Here's why:  1. Stunning 4K HDR Display: The 4K HDR 10-bit display delivers vivid and lifelike images. Whether I'm watching movies, sports, or playing games, the picture quality is top-notch.  2. Rich Sound Experience: The 20W speakers with Dolby+ DTS-HD technology provide powerful room-filling sound. It's like having a mini home theater right in my living room!  3. PatchWall with Massive Content Catalog: The PatchWall 3.0 interface offers a seamless experience with access to a wide range of content. From Netflix to Disney+ Hotstar, there's something for everyone.  4. Smooth Android TV Integration: With Google Assistant built-in, I can control my TV using voice commands.

TV quality Built: GOOD Picture quality: GOOD Sound quality: GOOD UI interface: GOOD. But if you are looking to pay 24K and get this TV to work only for 2 years. Then i would recommend you to find something else. This TV last ONLY 2 Years. I have brought this TV online and another redmi TV offline. BOTH WORKS ONLY WITHIN THE 2 YEARS LIFESPAN.

"Background : I was in search for a good but not pricey TV because of the following  1. My Samsung 49"" K6300 Curved TV had gone kaput in 4-5 years (DOP - Somewhere in 2017 - early 2018) 2. I was dragging my old TV with ever growing shadows accompanied with visibility issues. 3. K6300 was an eye pleasure when in good condition with amazing blacks and motion smoothness - beautiful out of the box colors.  Since a Tier 1 brand like Samsung had betrayed the trust after paying a premium , I was in the lookout of a mid range TV with up-to-date features - my check list included the following  1. Solid warranty clause with no Money extorsion policies like LG OLED post 1 year end. 2. Good sound system - Preferably with a sub-woofer. 3. Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.

"I've had this TV now for near 4 months. The positives are that the build quality, picture quality & sound quality are all great. The only two negatives are the OS & the lack of Filmmaker mode. So I recommend getting a FireTV device or a similar device to remedy the OS issue; the lack of Filmmaker mode means you will need to manually adjust the picture quality to give you the best viewing experience possible. Having said this the TV is still a very good buy at the price.",POSITIVE

"Background : I was in search for a good but not pricey TV because of the following  1. My Samsung 49"" K6300 Curved TV had gone kaput in 4-5 years (DOP - Somewhere in 2017 - early 2018) 2. I was dragging my old TV with ever growing shadows accompanied with visibility issues. 3. K6300 was an eye pleasure when in good condition with amazing blacks and motion smoothness - beautiful out of the box colors.  Since a Tier 1 brand like Samsung had betrayed the trust after paying a premium , I was in the lookout of a mid range TV with up-to-date features - my check list included the following  1. Solid warranty clause with no Money extorsion policies like LG OLED post 1 year end. 2. Good sound system - Preferably with a sub-woofer. 3. Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.  I think I am tending to increase ratings from 4 to 5 stars. Just for the REGZA Pic & Sound from Toshiba.

"Today i purchased the 50-inch Wooble QLED TV, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The picture quality is simply stunning—sharp, vibrant colors and deep contrasts make watching movies or shows a truly immersive experience. Whether it's HD or 4K content, the visuals are crisp and crystal clear, doing full justice to the QLED technology.  The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering rich, full-bodied audio that complements the visual experience. I didn't need any external speakers as the in-built sound system offers a well-balanced range of highs and lows, making it perfect for everything from action-packed films to quiet dialogues.  The design of the TV is another highlight—sleek, modern, and minimalist. It seamlessly blends into any room, and the slim bezels ensure that your focus is always on the screen. It’s a stylish addition to my living room, and the overall build quality feels premium.  Lastly, I want to commend the delivery service. The TV arrived on time, exactly as promised, in perfect condition. The packaging was secure, and the setup process was hassle-free.  Overall, Wooble has done an outstanding job with this QLED TV. For a Made-in-India brand, it competes with international brands in terms of both performance and design. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Remote buttons have poor response - after 3 to 5 press of button, it mostly responds once - the hassles to the user is enormous. However, Amazon policy does not allow replacement of only remote. Either return the product in totality or live with the problematic accessories. So, after taking out from the box and then installation taking about 4 to 5 hours, customer will have to undo all and then re-pack. What a punishment for the customer! Please surely to be carefull while buing any consumer durable from Amazon. 2. Wall mounting kit is actually a clamp to hang the TV and no tilting to change viewing angle is possible. The word ""kit"" is a misnomer. 3. Picture quality is more or less OK; colour response and contrast are poor",NEGATIVE

"I have bought this TV in the month of September 2024. The screen is bright and clear and so far no issue with the connectivity of the TV. The sound quality is good. For this price, it's a good TV. The installation process was also smooth and the technician was polite and explained well.",POSITIVE

"Image quality and sound quality is good, easy to operate",POSITIVE
"At present the screen has several greyish colour spots on the screen. I should have checked it with a simple test : white wallpaper image or white video. I was able to confirm this issue in February-March 2023. I contacted Hisense. Their service team or whoever they have outsourced the service job to is poor. When the TV was under ""manufacturer's warranty"" this greyish issue was not resolved. But after a long time and several attempts this issue which began in February 2023 has finally been resolved in December 2023. Note that it might have been a pre-existing issue but the fact is that I noticed and was able to make sure that it was definitely an issue in February 2023. And again - to be specific - issue has not been resolved but I have been adequately compensated financially by the 3rd party insurance company. As per the service team associated with the insurance company the grey spots repair was not possible due to location, cost prohibitive, etc reasons therefore the insurance company refunded the amount (after deducting the service charges, depreciation, etc). So yes, issue has been resolved in that way which is also okay\good.  The TV screen was packed and delivered with protection using ample plastic lamination. There were 4 different protective lamination in front. There was one big lamination which covered the main screen. Then there were 2 lamination like tapes to hold this main lamination. Then there was one lamination which covered the Hisense brand name panel which is located at the bottom of the screen.  The volume control bar is 100% opaque. It is bright, white and 100% opaque and spoils the view. Moreover, when I try to change volume then this volume bar appears at the middle bottom of the screen. It is not helpful because it completely obscures the subtitles/captions and various other on screen texts/images. This volume bar is TV's system feature or perhaps it is an Android 11 feature. Location of the volume bar should be on the left or right of the screen not bottom. Else, they should have provided an option to change the transparency of the volume bar.  When this TV is about to go to standby it shows a black pop-up in the middle of the screen with the countdown timer. There is no way to cancel or snooze this timer at that moment. So it is not helpful especially if you are watching something important. TV will turn off to standby and you can't do anything about it at that moment.  The location, size, shape, etc of the mute button on the remote is not good at all. Mute button should be of a unique shape. It should be bigger than other buttons and easier to access. Button has been placed in the middle of all buttons which makes it difficult to access it conveniently/ immediately if you are watching something in dark.  I had a Sony LCD TV before. It had an excellent feature of keeping the screen off while audio was still on. It was a very helpful feature. This feature is not available in this TV.  Moreover, the Sony TV had another very useful feature which this TV doesn't have. The display area settings. There were 3 options in the display area settings in the Sony TV viz +1, 0, and -1 which were very helpful. This feature isn't available in this TV.  Options of screensaver timer are few and fixed eg 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc. I wish it was possible to set the screensaver timer of my choice eg 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, etc minutes.  In the Play Store app the installed apps often don't update even after several manual attempts let alone auto update. This is not good.  The OS is Android 11 and still there is no dark mode feature in the TV.  There should be a page up/down feature in the remote. This feature is needed quite often in various apps to browse through various genres, titles, etc. Tapping the up, down, left , right, etc keys repeatedly only to move between titles one by one requires a lot of effort and is a waste of time. It also causes hardware damage because the up, down, left, right, etc keys will wear off quickly and I'll have to buy a new remote soon.  I was focused on so many other features, prices, etc that while making a decision to buy this TV I totally forgot about confirming the energy rating before placing the order. When I placed the order nowhere was it mentioned on Amazon that it has only a 3 star energy rating. I am disappointed with this. I found out that this TV has only a 3 star energy rating after I received the delivery. The energy rating is mentioned on the sticker attached to the protective plastic lamination on the TV screen.  I had a very bad wall mount installation experience with the service company associated with this TV brand but that's a different and a long story and I guess will not be appreciated if I include that in this review.  There are several options in TV Options. One of which is the picture option. In this picture option there is a very helpful option called display mode. This display mode has 6 options. One of which is a 4:3 aspect ratio which is indeed very helpful. But unfortunately there is no option to zoom the video if you have selected this 4:3 aspect ratio. Due to which there are a lot of empty black spaces (black bars) on all 4 sides of the video. These bars or empty spaces are absolutely all right. But I also need to see the 4:3 videos in zoomed in / zoomed out mode sometimes. So an additional setting of zoom in and zoom out ""after"" selecting 4:3 display mode would have been terrific. Wish they had also included a 7th option of cinema aspect ratio ie 2.39:1 in the picture option. There is no aspect ratio above 16:9.  There are 7 modes in picture mode. If you try to change picture mode then there will be a pop-up warning saying ""this option may result in higher energy consumption"". Now amongst these 7 modes there is an ENERGY SAVING mode also. It is surprising that when you try to select this mode the same pop-up warning appears. This is contradictory. How can selecting energy saving mode result in higher energy consumption?  The home screen interface is not easy to use. The selected item or title should be prominent or conspicuous e.g. the selected item should be surrounded by a white / coloured outline so that it is easy to decipher which item is currently under selection. At present the selected item just gets a little bigger which is often difficult to distinguish from other items.  There is no option to download movies, shows, etc in any app unlike mobile phones, tablets, etc. There is no download option at all even in major apps such as Netflix, Amazon prime video, YouTube etc to watch something when offline. This is unexpected and disappointing.  I have a Bluetooth version 4.2 headphones. I could not find the Bluetooth version of the TV mentioned anywhere in the TV. I could not find the Bluetooth version of the tablet mentioned anywhere in the tablet either. The only info available in the tablet is that the Bluetooth AVRCP version is 1.4. The Bluetooth version of the tablet is probably 4.2 as per the information available on the tablet company / brand website. So anyway, I have already paired the headphones with this TV and the tablet. I usually connect headphones either with the tablet or this TV. Now if the headphones are already connected with the tablet and not with TV and then if I disconnect the headphones from the tablet (by switching off the Bluetooth of the tablet) then the headphones should automatically connect with TV. But that doesn't happen. I have to reboot the headphones so that it can automatically connect to TV.  While watching the new The Invisible Man movie (most probably on Netflix app) the visual experience was not good. The movie features a lot of greyish / dark / night scenes. These scenes looked blurry / unclear as if some sort of fog or vapour was floating on the screen. It appears that this TV is not very efficient in displaying true deep darkness in these types of scenes.  Remote often doesn't work efficiently or effectively when casting or screen mirroring e.g. it takes several attempts / pressing the up, down, left right, etc keys of the remote control before the progress bar appears on the TV screen. Progress bar is a basic necessity nowadays so that one could fast forward or fast backward a video.  If I am not mistaken, nowhere on the product page on Amazon or the TV package is mentioned that a wall mount bracket set will be provided. Moreover, there is no mention of the list of all the parts in the wall bracket set pack. There were 8 items in total. Or 1+2+2+2+2+3+3+4=19 individual pieces in total if you count the number of pieces in each item. Or 1+2+2+2+2+3+15+4=31 individual parts in total if you count every part of each piece e.g. each expansive bolt is made up of 5 parts. They should have mentioned this list on the box or on a paper or manual or somewhere appropriate.  I don't know why these brands don't recommend or provide a screen cleaning kit.  You can switch between wall hanging and tabletop mode yourself. You just need to attach the 2 tripod stands using regular screwdrivers. Screws and stands are provided with the TV. But table top stand mode is not satisfactory because it is unstable even on smooth straight surfaces.. TV wobbles when it is on the two tripod stands which- needless to mention - is precarious.  I have paired this TVs Bluetooth with my Moto g04 Android 14 smartphone Bluetooth several times. I wanted to use smartphone as remote control. But this TV keeps disappearing from the phone's Bluetooth list. Hisense support says TV won't pair with phone. Phone support says talk to Hisense.  Conclusion : Not satisfactory. Therefore - overall - after considering everything I rate this TV 2⭐ or 4/10. Since submitting 2.5 STARS is not possible here on Amazon therefore i have no option but to rate it 2 stars. I find it very difficult to rate it 3 stars because to me 3 stars stand for a faultless but good (or average) product (or service).",NEGATIVE

"If you are looking for a good USB 3 cable with micro end to support an external hard drive, etc..this is certainly a cable worth not over-looking. I ordered a Western Digital ""My Passport"" external drive to back up my music, photos, videos, etc. and though one does come with the external drive, they fail to mention that it's only a foot long. Many reviewers said that the included cable with the Passport drive was of low quality and that they had issues with it so when I ordered mine I took it a step up and got the Amazon Basics cable as a ""just in case needed"" scenario. Well turns out I am glad I got it because this cable is six feet vs. the included Western Digital USB cable being only a foot long, if even that. That may be fine for folks connecting the drive to a laptop in a portable setting, but I need a cable that is long enough to reach the drive sitting on my desk to my tower PC which sits on the floor. This cable is also thick and has gold plated ends so it appears to be of high quality. My PC is USB 2.0 only and the cable is backwards compatible and still allows for a very reasonable transfer of files (it took about 3 hrs to back up 380+ GB to my external drive with this cable, so I suppose that's pretty good). Highly recommended if you need a separate USB to micro conversion cable and don't want to spend a lot of money. Look no further, this is the one you want.",POSITIVE
"At first I thought that this was not an Amazon product because the packaging was just a jiffy bag folded over double for added protection. The lead is made of heavy gauge wire for the power transfer without significant voltage drop - beware thin cables that feel lighter: they cannot handle the higher currents required by fast-charging mobile phones and by terabyte hard drives without a significant voltage drop over their 1.8 metres length. The connectors at either end are of moulded construction with royal blue colour coded plugs indicating that they are for usb 3.0 and they are quite chunky. For most uses that makes them ideal for fast and frequent removal and connecting - they do not easily slip from your grip. Data transfers were quick and without errors even on USB 2.0 as the read and write speeds of a usb 3.0 device in usb 2.0 mode are near the theoretical limits of usb 2.0 unless there is a problem with the cable or the connection. All in all, I would say that the Amazon Basics USB 3.0 A Male to Micro B 1.8m is a winner all round, especially at the price.",NEGATIVE

"The lan adopter is working fine. But the speed is limited to 100 Mbps [ As described in the specifications]. I run the speed test with my “Fire TV stick 4K Max” with the LAN adopter and with the WIFI. But the WIFI wins the test with more speed and streaming level. My JIO fibre broadband speed is 100mbps. The LAN adopter is streaming the 4K without any buffering. Early I purchased the same adopter, but that adopter is not allowing the 4K streaming properly. Causing above, I return the adopter and that adopter is made in China. The new one is made in Vietnam. Very important observation, if the WIFI signal is good then no need this LAN adopter. But the only big advantage is that, away from the radio transmission and stable streaming. Overall the LAN adopter is OK",POSITIVE
"Admittedly, it's my fault. I didn't read the description.  It's 10/100 ethernet standard. In 2023. This means it can hit a max speed of 100 Mbps. In 2023. I can get about 300 Mbps with my current (pretty old) wifi router. Gigabit speed should be a minimum in 2023 (if not 2.5 Gbps).  If you have wifi issues, do yourself a favour and buy another wifi access point for the same money it would cost you to buy this. Install it close to the Fire TV stick or TV. Enjoy lag-free/buffer-free experience. You will also get the additional benefit of getting better wifi signal for the other devices in your house.  I really like the Fire TV stick. But this ethernet add-on is terrible.",NEGATIVE
"If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.  Connectivity & Ease of Use:  Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.  Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:  Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.  That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.  Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:  Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.  Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:  I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.  Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:  Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.  App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:  Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.  Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.  Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:  Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. It’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.  If you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering. It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.",POSITIVE
"There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.  The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating. Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.  You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.  The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.  As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like. If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.  That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.  The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.  They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option. The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.",NEGATIVE
"Nice product no damage Battery backup is good single charge is up to 1 week I like magnetic ON OFF system it's really simplefied the on off method and easy to operate They giving 3 fitted sizes to your ears S,M,L Fast connectivity with mobile Perfectly fitted to ears Perfect functionality Finally value for money product from 1 Plus brand",POSITIVE
"I love these headphones! They used to be my daily until I started wearing a bud type one, but I still wear these at night. I listen to books or podcasts as I fall asleep and I don't lose them because they're around my neck (and no, I haven't even felt like I have been at risk to be strangled! Haha) they are comfortable and great sounding, and love that the magnetic closure stops the music. They're easy to connect to other devices and turn on and off. I've now bought 3 pairs (because I sleep in them, the cord gets shorted out)but I'm sure if I didn't they'd have lasted me even longer. Hope I never have to find another pair of headphones like this!",POSITIVE
"Bought these for the 2-3 hours a week I am at the gym and the battery life is good. The fit is good and the design is nice in my opinion, very slim and light weight. Despite the magnetic connection of the earbuds being the only way to power down the device this has not been an issue, they snap together and power down flawlessly. They are comfortable and the connection is the fastest I've ever seen and they connect to my S24 within a few seconds after separating the magnetic backs of the earbuds. Sound quality is decent, but the price and functionality has surpassed expectations as I've been using them for over 5 months and I've only had to charge them maybe once every other week for like 30 minutes.",POSITIVE
"Good quality, little bigger the end of the neck band because of a bigger battery. Sound and noise cancelation better than previous model. Ear tips smaller and lighter, for me hold really good even running, better bass and treble.",POSITIVE
"Nice earphones, my third set of wireless buds and this version has more bass. Battery lasts along time and very quick to charge. I wear these more than my xm5's",POSITIVE
This is exactly what I wanted without having to pay 2k for one. Quality is actually just what you need. Perfect fit. Chose the Velcro adhesive for mounting. Everything about it is perfect.,POSITIVE
"The product fits perfectly and is quite sturdy. I appreciated the inclusion of Velcro, making it easy to remove and reattach. However, the screws provided could be of better quality; both of them broke during fastening. Fortunately, these are standard screws easily available locally for around 2 rupees. While the price tag of 699 rupees might seem a bit high, it's still a satisfactory product overall, especially with the added convenience of the Velcro.",POSITIVE
It is what it is. Works and price is good.,POSITIVE
Good one,POSITIVE

"It did work for my sanyo TV, hence giving a 1 star rating.  They have falsely advertised this product that this is a sanyo remote.  i bought and tried three different brand of batteries in this remote, thinking that maybe changing batteries in remote will make it work. big waste of money.",NEGATIVE

"This TV offers excellent picture quality with vibrant colors and sharp 4K resolution. Sound is also clear .The smart features are intuitive, with a responsive interface but a limited app store due to the OS. Its sleek design and ample connectivity options are also strong points. it's a solid choice for those seeking a high-quality TV at a reasonable price. Would recommend, especially for casual viewers.",POSITIVE
I have been using this tv since last 3 months and its the best tv anyone can consider at this price range with best 4k gaming features and quality output. It provides great colour and audio quality is also perfect over all sound effects - consist with good function and all expected and used ports - vidaa os is very smooth and with updates i think will provide better options - brightness over 70% feels very adequate and perfect  overall can be considered as the best 4k gaming tv with good refresh rate in budget range of 50-60k,POSITIVE
"Only thing that this tv lacked was the OS(not google/android). But after 3 months I think hisense own OS ""Vida"" is way faster,snappy. Casting your laptop or android phone has no lag. Also has airplay.  Specs are near perfect [in Q3/2024]. Speakers 40wt is good enough. I rarely turn on my home theater unless I neeed that Booom in my living room. Sound is enough to fill a big indian living room.  Only negative: google has more apps. Vida is adding apps but they need pick up some pace. They have all the basic apps you would need. You can run any video audio format via usb. No need to install video players. In jan 2025 these apps as available: Netflix,youtube, disneyplus, prime, sony, zee5, apply, crunchy roll, jio cinema, yupptv.  Most of the other are not for India region. No VPN app that I could find.  Conclusion: worth your money, perfect specs, needs more india based apps, no issues with PS5 or Ps4.",POSITIVE
"This is my second Hisense TV purchase, and I am very pleased once again. The picture quality is excellent. The sound quality is impressive considering the slim build of the TV; the subwoofer is decent, providing enough bass, though it doesn’t quite match the depth of a dedicated subwoofer. So you'll have to go for external speakers if you want that extra thump.  This TV has a lot of features, many of which I haven't tested yet. The Vidaa OS operates smoothly, but the downside with it not being an android/Google TV is the limited availability of apps. I'm a Spotify subscriber and I often listen to music on my old Hisense android tv which seamlessly connects with spotify, but this TV doesn't, which is disappointing. And if you have a Hotstar Premium subscription, you won’t be able to watch content in 4K on this TV for some reason, it only goes upto 1080p. However, I have paired this TV with a Jio STB, so I don't rely on the built-in apps much.  Overall, it’s a very good TV if you primarily want to enjoy your TV channels and some OTT apps.  I'd give it a solid 4.5/5 ⭐",POSITIVE
"I owned a Hisense Television which I was really happy with, and that encouraged me to choose Hisense while I was looking for a bigger size. And with all honesty, I can say that this one's even better. Picture, Sound, Built, even the viewing angles are excellent. Perfect TV at justifyable price",POSITIVE
"The Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers an excellent combination of performance, features, and value. With a large 65-inch screen, it delivers crisp 4K resolution, vibrant colors, and decent contrast. The picture quality is solid for the price, making it a great choice for those who want an affordable yet high-performing TV for watching movies, TV shows, or gaming.  The smart features are intuitive and easy to use, thanks to its Android TV platform, which provides access to a wide variety of streaming services, apps, and built-in voice control with Google Assistant. The TV supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, offering an enhanced viewing experience with deeper blacks and brighter highlights.  In terms of design, the Hisense 65-inch TV has a sleek and modern look, with slim bezels that allow for a more immersive viewing experience. The sound quality is decent, but for an enhanced audio experience, pairing it with an external soundbar or home theater system might be a good idea.  Connectivity options are solid, with multiple HDMI ports, USB inputs, and Wi-Fi support, making it easy to hook up your devices.  Overall, the Hisense 65-inch Smart TV offers impressive value for its price, delivering great picture quality, user-friendly smart features, and a modern design. It’s a solid option for anyone looking for a large, budget-friendly smart TV.",POSITIVE
Im super impressed by this tv. Amazing quality crisp sound and video. Lets hope it has longetivity! For now definetly worth every rupee,POSITIVE
"Bought this Q7N Tornado in August 2024. Review after 4 months :- Problem : bright colors causes eye strain. I even tried cinema mode, film maker mode, energy saving mode, standard mode of video but the eyes pain / eyes feel tired after watching the TV from 10-12 feet distance for 1 to 2 hours.  Benefits: Very good picture quality and clarity. 4k is very nice but too bright. Sound quality is very good nothing negative there. Connectivity options are good hdmi, usb, Bluetooth WiFi all connect very well. Vida OS is awesome no lag so far and I need only few apps like Netflix, prime, YouTube, hotstar ,zee5, sonyliv. All these apps are sufficient.  Since the screen is smooth, if you have tubelight or light or window directly opposite face to the TV then you see the reflection/glare of that tubelight or window sun light. Need to make the room darker by curtains or off the tubelight to remove its glare. I wish the screen was with matt anti-glare finishing.  Atleast I hope the company puts out some video settings recommendations to reduce eye strain for watching this TV. My old Samsung LCD 32 inch screen was better and caused no eye strain.",POSITIVE
good quality for a good price,POSITIVE
"Multiple options of audio/video input/output. I can connect my Bluetooth headphones to it. Picture quality is great. Can control with phone via App. Some was saying that it is a bit slow to respond, I don't feel so. View angles are great, colour stays same at any direction. It's worth it money. Using it for 5 months so far.",POSITIVE
"BEST VALUE FOR MONEY, KEPT SEARCHING FOR 6 MONTHS, AND WHEN I PURCHASED IT, I WAS SO SCARED TO REGRET IT!  AND NOW AFTER COUPLE OF MONTHS I CAN CONFIRM I DID NOT REGRET IT! I USE IT ONLY TO WATCH CARTOON FOR KIDS AND ME STREAMING. I HAVE A CHROME CAST, BUT NO LONGER USING IT THE SOFTWARE IS STABLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME USE IT DIRECTLY AND NO CHROME CAST LIKE MY OLD TV  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,",NEGATIVE
"It's worth the price, i realy like this TV E7k 55""!!!picture quality,the tv speaker,for gaming ps5 with 60hz native.hiw fast to navigate on the homescreen.like they say, i recommend this TV with good features that will not break the bank.. But if you have budget for qled like this with 144hz go for it. But for me, from my 7 y/o LG 59"" its a great upgrade and i am satisfied with this TV.",POSITIVE
good in evry thing except it is vivid system not open app sestem program no way to add any app out of vivid stor,NEGATIVE
Fits best for 55” Sony Bravia OLED XR 55A80K Covers most of the surface. Sill icon based. Slightly (~20%) transparent. Good grip.

Doorstep convenience does come with some compromises.,NEGATIVE
"Product quality is good, but doesn't serve the purpose as it is not properly alligned",NEGATIVE

Very bad quality and not perfect product for sony remote control.,NEGATIVE
Fits perfectly with Sony remote. Cutouts are perfect. Only the colour is not very appealing. Does not match advertised colour.,NEGATIVE
Good responsive buttons. Working well with our TV,POSITIVE
Working fine with my TV. No functioning issues so far.  Fitting and quality of back battery cover/cap is bad. Look like saperate cover has been attached with another remote. Not fitting perfectly with remote. Looks like it cover and remote made in two different factories.  I ordered two remotes at same time and both came with same non matching battery cover so not a one of case.  4 star for remote. Ignoring the cover/cap issue.,NEGATIVE
"I bought this remote based on the reviews posted here and I didn't want to spend more money on my 8 years old Sony LED Tv. In first glance, remote plastic looks cheap and breakable, no way near to actual Sony TV remote. But having said that I just bought for 280 odd rupees, what more should I expect with it. Remote works fines, I saw occasional lag but overall it works absolutely fine. It doesn't come with the batteries, so you will need to purchase it separately.",POSITIVE
"Just keeping it as there was no alternative to purchase. The TV needs a remote. Blame sony bravia for not having any stocks and if any then not pricing it reasonably (VFM).  this is an aftermarket (Made in China) very poor quality remote. Better use a good quality plastic housing on it, as no trust on the quality of plastics used.",NEGATIVE
Buttons too hard to press and stopped working after a week. Even after putting new batteries it doesn't work. Warranty is a hoax as nobody picks up the call,NEGATIVE
"If u dont want to buy original costly remotes for your branded electronic appliances. You can surely go to this Upix remotes. They work undoubtedly like the original one. Quality of body and keys are satisfactory. On top of that, prices are comparative with other universal type remotes sells in market. My Upix remote is exactly look like the original one and didnt feel any lagging in response. Go for it if ur child accidently or intentionally broken your remote. 😊",POSITIVE
The seller provides support in selecting compatible remote... Send old remote photo and no. and they will provide the link for compatible remote... The suggested remote works seamlessly with my TV.... the quality could be more better... so provided 4 stars in sturdiness.... Satisfied with the purchase.,NEGATIVE
Works good without any issues. Build quality could have been better.,POSITIVE
"Background : I was in search for a good but not pricey TV because of the following  1. My Samsung 49"" K6300 Curved TV had gone kaput in 4-5 years (DOP - Somewhere in 2017 - early 2018) 2. I was dragging my old TV with ever growing shadows accompanied with visibility issues. 3. K6300 was an eye pleasure when in good condition with amazing blacks and motion smoothness - beautiful out of the box colors.  Since a Tier 1 brand like Samsung had betrayed the trust after paying a premium , I was in the lookout of a mid range TV with up-to-date features - my check list included the following  1. Solid warranty clause with no Money extorsion policies like LG OLED post 1 year end. 2. Good sound system - Preferably with a sub-woofer. 3. Full content support for Netflix & Prime Videos - Dolby Vision/Atmos/HDR10+ 4. Solid Blacks - K6300 got me a taste of it 5. IPS panel - if available 6. 10 bit panel preferably with wide color gamut of 1 billion + colors 7. HDMI 2.1, eARC 8. Solid color optimization chip/engine 9. Intended for Casual Gaming.  Source (for Recommendation) - VMONE.in ( Vineet Malhotra -Can't thank him enough with words)  Purchase History Order Placed - 14.7.23 Inv. Dt 15.7.23 Delivered - 17.7.23 by 11 AM Supplier - Dawntech ( Kolkata warehouse I suppose) Installation Dt - 17.7.23 by 4:30 PM ( After 1-2 hours of delivery , had to place a call log in Toshiba CC no mentioned on Box)  Product Experience :  Vida OS - Is seemingly lighter than Taizen (ref. Samsung K6300) Using TV with Airtel Xstream - 200 Mbps Unltd. connection 4K HDMI Cable - Not Supplied  Pic Quality - Colors out of the box need calibration/setting as per your own taste. HDMI 1 port will support Dolby Atmos & HDR , while switching to HDMI 1 from other ports - 10 bit display msg shows which is a good sign ( Review tell it otherwise - 8 bit FRC ) DTH Performance - Full HD channels work like a charm with upscaling , SD channel are OK as expected. Really liked DTH HD channels like Set max, Times Now News Star Sports etc.  Content Performance - Youtube- Properly coded 4k videos work flawlessly with great sound and clarity and zero lag. Netflix & Prime Vid - After personal color setting these look amazing , with magnificent blacks. Watched Indian and Hollywood series and movies. There is some amount of glare as well - used warm yellow lamp shade light for viewing in moderately lit room.  Sound : Played classic 90s melodies and found the base (from Sub woofer) quite pleasing and not over powering ( Boost Effect @ 2)  Over all satisfied with Panel and sound . Will further do tweaks with picture settings. Please consider this as my initial impressions. Will update as my usage will increase over weeks.  Update 9.8.2023  I had to finally re-calibrate the pic setting manually. Out of the box - backlight was set to max, increased sharpness etc. Just Googled the common pic setting for major brands - including Toshiba and got it corrected.  Watched Netflix Doc Veerappan (Tested in White/Yellow light and dark conditions) and found the visual quite appealing- after pic settings my mode resembles Cinema mode. The TV does not have Pic/Color presets rather has HDR presets as Day Std Night Sports.  Sound - I keep my windows - just behind my sofa open so amidst vehicle sound also the dialogues were clear. Thanks to surround sound and in-built woofer.  Fire Stick - Happy to see email from Toshiba in my inbox for free coupon. Sad that I had purchased it along with the TV at a special price. Planning to sell it on OLX and get the free one from the Company.  DTH - HD Channels Very clear with Dolby Digital Logo enabled. DD National (Classic SD)- Close up scenes also very fine, distant scenes also not bad Gaming - Yet to connect PS4. Sports- Watched badminton videos in 4K 50 hz - smashes @ 420 Kmph never left a trail on screen. Wimbledon 2023 Finals on 1080 - Good as the recordings were subdued fearing piracy by Disney Hotstar  Have run all sample 4K Dolby Vision & HDR content that youtubers swear by- got solid performance from TV  Slow Vidaa OS rant from everyone is a sham. Experience it to believe it . It is faster than my Airtel Xtreme Android Box - the one that receives regular updates!  Rest you can easily check display running hours from diving deep into settings.  I think I am tending to increase ratings from 4 to 5 stars. Just for the REGZA Pic & Sound from Toshiba.  Good and durable Japanese brands Like Sanyo, Toshiba, Panasonic ( that bring in proprietary tech) should be endorsed (even thought they may be manufactured locally under strategic partnerships) by the Indians else everything is gonna be PRC/Korea Inspired.",POSITIVE
"Initially I want to buy infinix qled t.v because of earlier experience with the brand was good moreover it was 8000 Rs economical to Toshiba but I switch over to Toshiba because of brand reputation most of the well-known brands like infinix,Motorola,Kodak,Blaupunkt, Thomson etc. used to market third party manufacturers product though I am not certain Toshiba manufacturer this t.v or it is also playing the same game but I take a bet because of goodwill and three years of warranty which no other brand is providing.I have been using the t.v for three months I have following observations about this t.v- 1-Picture quality is great (Good contrast,Punchy colours, Wide colour gamut,No screen bleeding issues,Deeper black level) can be good or at par with brands like Samsung,LG, Panasonic inferior to Sony) so there is no comparison with other brands they will fall short. 2- Toshiba's proprietary Regza chip is damm fast as well as do best upscaling moreover it's own ui makes it fast in comparison to android t.v's present in the market don't compare it's ram and rom because it can do it's work swiftly in comparision with brands having double ram and rom nodoubt because of rom storage can be issue for some. 3- Sound quality is great to me it varies person to person vocals are clear and crisp, lacking bass and surround experience is great.sound is pleasing in most of scenarios like 4k movies, webseries,games,news, loudness is sufficient for room 12×15 size of room is at par with Samsung and LG t.v's of this size. 4- settings menu is easily operable, build quality is good,great aesthetics with well built functional remote. Can be improved -. 1- Bass 2-behaves like va panel so viewing angles are not that great but not that much colour shift is seen. After one month see my video review of this t.v on my YouTube channel shobhits exact evaluation .",POSITIVE
"I've had this TV now for near 4 months. The positives are that the build quality, picture quality & sound quality are all great. The only two negatives are the OS & the lack of Filmmaker mode. So I recommend getting a FireTV device or a similar device to remedy the OS issue; the lack of Filmmaker mode means you will need to manually adjust the picture quality to give you the best viewing experience possible. Having said this the TV is still a very good buy at the price.",POSITIVE

"I recently upgraded my TV to the Hisense 55-inch U7N Series 4K Ultra HD Smart QLED Mini LED TV, and I’m absolutely thrilled with it! Here’s why I think this TV is a game-changer for anyone looking to boost their home entertainment experience.  Brilliant Picture Quality  First off, the picture quality is simply stunning. The 4K Ultra HD resolution combined with QLED technology brings out vibrant colors and sharp details, making everything from movies to sports look incredibly lifelike. The Mini LED backlighting ensures deep blacks and bright whites, providing an impressive contrast that truly enhances the viewing experience.  Smart and Easy to Use  Navigating through the smart features is a breeze. The built-in apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and YouTube are super responsive, and the interface is user-friendly. It’s easy to switch between streaming services, and the voice control feature makes searching for content even more convenient. Plus, with built-in Wi-Fi, connecting to the internet is quick and hassle-free.  Excellent Sound  I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. The built-in speakers deliver clear and balanced audio, making dialogue easy to understand and adding depth to the overall sound experience. While I still prefer using my soundbar for a more immersive sound, the TV’s audio is definitely impressive on its own.  Value for Money  Considering all the high-end features packed into this TV, it’s great value for money. Hisense has really delivered a premium viewing experience at a competitive price point. It’s a fantastic investment for anyone who loves watching TV, gaming, or streaming content in the highest quality possible.",POSITIVE
"Been using this TV since last couple of weeks now, I can easily say that it's a great TV. The display, the sound is great. The remote feels sturdy and overall performance of the TV is awesome. Only if I have to nitpick, i can say that viewing angles are not that great but that's expected as TV comes with VA panel, and the stand, or infact the cover is made of plastic. But this is not a deal-breaker as this TV offer you great viewing experience with great sound!",POSITIVE
"1. This Mini LED tech is Bright and Vivid. Really good with HDR Content. 2. Vidaa OS interface is fast and responsive, One concern they really need to address as soon as possible is to have at-least indian market specific entertainment apps that are available on Google TV with individual app updates functionality. Eg: Hotstar runs at max resolution of 1080p, Sonyliv runs at max resolution of 720p and other apps that are important to this market like say Zee5, Spotify, Fancode, Sunnxt and Aha does not come pre installed or available in this Vidaa store (Was really let down in this aspect). 3. Packed with features for a future conscious investment. ALLM, VRR works great for console gaming 4. Comes with 3years brand warranty. Its long-term durability remains to be seen. 5. Inbuilt speakers are good enough for an average sized room  - Happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a budget friendly, feature-packed TV with some compromises on the software side!",POSITIVE
"I was a bit sceptical for 60hz, but i dont game a lot so i went ahead and bought this. Picture quality is superb. Youtube 4k hdr video are very near to oled clarity. It is due to mini led i suppose. Black are detailed. Picture quality is suberb. Aslo 20Watt speaker are pretty good. All in all a good buy...",POSITIVE
"I bought the hisense 65 inch mini LED TV after seeing their advertisements during the Euro tournament. I also did my own research online to satisfy myself on the product - but most of the reviews I read were good. However, my regular TV guy warned me against hisense saying that they had terrible after sales service/record. However, (unfortunately) I chose to ignore his advice and went ahead with the purchase. The delivery and installation were good - no complaints. The quality of the TV is also good including the sound, colors etc. However, within a week of installation, a horizontal line appeared in the display. I was shocked and immediately called the hisense technician who visited and confirmed that this was a display defect and since the warranty covered it, I would be eligible for a replacement / new TV. That is when my nightmare began. I've made numerous phone calls and spoken to several agents who have assured me that my complaint will be 'escalated' (whatever that means) but to no avail. I've also been told that my replacement TV has arrived at the warehouse and would be dispatched to me within 2 days (which 2 days I am waiting since more than 2 weeks now) The call Centre agent has even cut my call when I refused to accept his explanation and asked to speak with his Supervisor. When I called back, I was promptly told that the Supervisor is busy (probably talking to more customers like myself) and would return my call within 2 hours but once again, this proved to be nothing but shallow excuses which I have now (unfortunately) become used to receiving from hisense. I don't know when my ordeal will end. I'm not going to give up until I get my TV replaced. But I am going to put out this review for one and all, especially in Mumbai, warning them NOT to go in for any Hisense product.",NEGATIVE
This TV is a masterpiece: 1. Picture Quality: Excellent brightness and black levels. Very good contrast and local dimming works very well. Colours are natural looking. Out of the box picture quality is not good so you need to tune it to your liking. 2. Sound Quality: I have never seen a TV sounds better than this. You don't need a soundbar if you install in a room 3. Features & OS: VIDA OS is fast and responsive 4. Price/Performance: The performance that you get for the price is very good  Overall this is an excellent TV and is is a must recommend,POSITIVE
"### Review: Sony TV Remote  I've been using the Sony TV Remote for a few weeks now, and it has proven to be a solid addition to my home entertainment setup. Here are my thoughts on its various features and performance:  #### Design and Build Quality The Sony TV Remote has a sleek and ergonomic design, making it comfortable to hold for extended periods. The buttons are well-placed and provide good tactile feedback. The build quality feels sturdy, and it seems like it can withstand the occasional drop without any issues.  #### Ease of Use Setting up the remote was straightforward. The instructions were clear, and I had it paired with my TV and other devices in no time. The remote's layout is intuitive, making it easy to navigate through different menus and settings. The backlit buttons are a nice touch, especially for use in low-light ### Conclusion Overall, the Sony TV Remote is an excellent choice for anyone looking to simplify their home entertainment experience. Its robust build quality, ease of use, and additional features make it a worthwhile investment. If you're tired of juggling multiple remotes, this one is definitely worth considering.  **Rating: 4.5/5**",POSITIVE
Good product,POSITIVE
Remote worked well for 5 days and then few buttons stopped working and now after 7 days it is not working at all!!!,NEGATIVE
Nice performance with all sony tv,POSITIVE
It's only work for TV not for Fire stick. Not a 2 in 1 remote.,NEGATIVE
"I got this remote to replace my old Sony TV remote, Model RMT-TX301P. I wasn't sure if it would work because the buttons were a little different, but it was the closest one I could find. All the buttons work, but the navigation buttons need a bit more pressure than the others. The remote seems to be made well enough. I got it really fast too; it came the same day I ordered it. My old remote highlighted in yellow lasted for seven years. I hope this one lasts that long too.",POSITIVE
"Worked like a charm, right out of the box, on Sony W772E. Above average build quality.",POSITIVE
"Very nice... Useful, but need some more material quality...",NEGATIVE
"Value For Money, Picture Clarity & Sound Quality Is Really Really Awesome Really I Liked This Product Quality Of Product is No.1 Installation Is Also Very Simple Size & Design Altimate.",POSITIVE
"Request you to please check properly at the time of delivery as there is bit scratches on the screen which i missed to notice during delivery and it appears after installation n all, so be careful. Unlike other smart TV's you wont get customise screen saver option with this for that it will auto start after 2 hours of still On, Otherwise the picture quality n all is good 👍, Sound is also good 👍 but sometimes feels bit down when u will compare other 55"" tv's. Installation process is very smooth, you will get wall mount kit from samsung Installation partner. Connectivity wise you will get hdmi, usb and cable port, bluetooth Connectivity is also there. Overall recommended from my side at this price.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.  1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good. 2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels 3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful. I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os. 4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative. 5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds 6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing. Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.  7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.  8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.  Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good.",POSITIVE
"The build quality is very pure ,the display flex, otherise the picture quality is very good, i found sound to be good while most people found it terrible i think its decent for a tv speaker, the os feels bit laggy but overall the tv is good. You can go for it.",POSITIVE
"Superb TV, I really made the right decision.  The bezels are thin from three sides, sound quality is good for 120-150 sqft room, display quality is amazing. The colors are natural tending to a cooler tone. Overall software experience is snappy, but when you on the tv for the first time when plugged into power supply the tv lags a lot for a minute.  Remote has solar as well as type C charging port.  The only thing I didn't liked is it's 4k upscaling, instead of improving smoothness, it makes it worse. Better to disable it.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Samsung Smart TV and I have to say, I’m quite impressed overall. Here’s a breakdown of my experience: Picture Quality: The 4K resolution is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep blacks. Whether I’m streaming a movie or playing video games, the visuals are sharp and immersive. The HDR capabilities really enhance the viewing experience, especially in darker scenes Sound Quality The built-in speakers deliver decent sound, but I found that adding a soundbar improved the audio experience significantly. Dialogue is clear, and the soundstage feels quite expansive for a TV of this size. Smart Features The interface is user-friendly, with easy access to popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. The remote is intuitive, featuring voice control, which is a nice touch. However, I noticed a slight lag when switching between apps Design The sleek design and thin bezels give it a modern look that fits well in any living room. The stand is sturdy, and mounting it on the wall was straightforward. Value for Money While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, I feel that the features and performance justify the price. If you're looking for a reliable Smart TV with great picture quality, this is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Overall, I highly recommend the [Brand Name] Smart TV Model [Model Number] for anyone in the market for a new TV. It offers a great balance of quality and features, making it a solid choice for both casual viewers and cinephiles alike.",POSITIVE

"Looks 4.5/5 Quality 4.5/5 Ease of installation 2/5 Durability 4/5 Pros: 1)looks good 2)Looks sturdy 3)Good service provided by bluwood  Cons 1) very sharp edges(be cautious while cleaning because it is sharp and I mean it) 2) it's highly recommended to get it installed by some carpenter or the installation guy because it is not some child's play and can take upto 3 to 4 or even more hours to get installed  Final verdict: most value for money and beyond, cut half star for installation and half for its sharp edge",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this DIY TV unit and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This unit is incredibly sturdy and was easy to assemble, even for someone who isn't particularly handy. It looks exactly like the product image shown online, which isn't always the case when buying online.  The quality of the materials used is excellent, and it feels like a piece that will last for years. I highly recommend this TV unit to anyone in need of a reliable and stylish TV unit. It's definitely worth the investment!",POSITIVE
"I’ve been a loyal Bluewud customer, and let me tell you—they never just deliver products; they deliver pleasant surprises! Their quality and service are so on point that even if something needs fixing or replacing, they handle it with a charm that leaves you thinking, “Why can’t all brands be like this?”  Their DIY setups are genius—so well-planned that even if you’re a DIY newbie, you’ll feel like an IKEA pro. It’s smooth sailing (or should I say, smooth like butter) from start to finish. Honestly, assembling their products is my favorite part. It’s like a mini ego boost every time I realize, “Hey, I can build this myself—who needs a handyman?”  Thank you, Bluewud India, for making me feel like a DIY champ and for setting the bar high. Keep the surprises and top-notch service coming—you’re nailing it!",POSITIVE
"I had ordered this product and the assured delivery date was showing as 27th November 2023. The product shipment was shown then all of a sudden in the tracking it appeared as canceled by the merchant. I had to raise a case with amazon for this. Amazon executive was so helpful. Bluewud called me and updated saying it was a technical issue and they are reshipping my order and will reach me by 28th November 2023. I waited then the updated delivery tracking was showing the delivery as 1st December 2023. The product reached my city on 29th and they were not delivering that. The delivery hub was hardly 10 kilometer away from my home. I had to call the Delhivery help desk multiple times to get that escalated. Every day they will provide the same update asking me to wait for 24 hours. On 4th I lost all my temper and I called them enquiring the same. The courier help desk was asking me to wait for another 24 hours or else they were asking me to cancel the order if I cannot wait.  The challenge is if you are ordering the product then you will end up calling multiple help desks for them to work. Amazon help desk, Bluewud, and Courier service. I won't order anything again which is managed by an external courier from Amazon never again. Such a terrible service. the courier guys were behaving as if they were giving me the service for free. There were no follow-up calls made from Bluewud regarding the same. This product was ordered as a gift for my friend's housewarming ceremony. I had added a buffer of 2 to 3 days when I was ordering the product on 9th November. Thinking by Dec 30th. I got the product only on 5th December. That too because of multiple follow-ups. They ruined the occasion I ended up giving the gift after the ceremony.  If you are ordering this product just have a check and see if delivery is managed by Amazon or not.  I have no complaints about the product. It was easy to fit and it was of good quality. But the logistics service was so bad.",NEGATIVE
"Product seems to be good minor defects in some edges which is okay. Door misalignment between two doors. White support or leg as per picture shows 5 quantity (4 corners and middle) but I recieved only 4 legs which I fixed in the corners. Not sure without middle support it can withstand its own load and deform in shape. So I placed a piece of wood in the middle for support. When contacted Amazon, they are taking it seriously and no or lean support. They said will raise an investigation and I need to follow it up without any acknowledgement on raised investigation.",NEGATIVE
Come in DIY kit......need more than one person to assemble.....the provide tools for assembling but trust your own tools only......its better if you can get some one with skills to assemble it beacuse you have to follow the detailed instructions step by step to assemble it....one step miss or mess up can lead to disassemble and reassemble the entire thing.....the rear wooden cover can be made sturdy....on high sounds it starts making vibrations and feels like it would come off....,NEGATIVE
Worth buying service good.Easy assemble. Good to buy.,POSITIVE
Same as shown. Easy to install. Protects your remote. Perfect size👍,NEGATIVE
This one fits my TCL TV Remote tightly and perfectly. Go for it,POSITIVE
"I purchased this silicone cover for my TCL TV remote RC802NU1, and overall, I'm really happy with it. The cover fits perfectly, providing excellent protection against scratches and drops. The material is soft and grippy, making it easy to hold onto the remote without it slipping. Plus, it adds a bit of color, which makes it easier to spot on the couch!  However, I was disappointed to see the price drop just a couple of days after I bought it. It would have been nice if there was some kind of price adjustment policy. That said, it's still a good buy if you're looking to protect your remote.",POSITIVE

"Using the TV Remote feels like a finger workout. Even after a giving it a tight press, it often refuses to cooperate,and do any functions. Its lack of reliability outweighs any convenience it might offer. If you want this to work toss it a few times gently on your floor it to work fine for 2 - 3 minutes. After that it stops working.",NEGATIVE

Else works decently,POSITIVE
"The remote stopped working within weeks. Also, when it was working, it wasn't very reliable. Voice search doesn't work which is fine but even buttons like Display Off, Mute, etc. didn't work. Worst part is that it didn't provide an option to Shut Down the TV but simply switched off the screen on pressing the power button and then when main power is turned off the TV OS suffers. If you have to buy a duplicate product buy other sellers as they are cheaper than this one.",NEGATIVE
Product is good and value for money,POSITIVE

And I got it for almost 27k with all bank offers and as a prime customer, I got the delivery the next day",POSITIVE

"As a first-time laptop user, the Dell 15 has exceeded my expectations with its excellent performance and versatile features. I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.  **Performance and Display:** Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.  **Portability and Build Quality:** Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.  **Value for Money:** At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.  **Future Updates:** I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time.

Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks.

"I recently purchased a Dell laptop from Amazon, expecting a hassle-free experience. Unfortunately, the laptop had significant issues with sound and audio quality. Upon reaching out to Amazon customer support, a technician troubleshot the issue and confirmed it was a defective product. The technician assured me that the laptop would be returned the next day.  However, I was unable to track the return process. When I followed up with customer support, I was told that I needed to visit a Dell service center to obtain a ""declined support letter"" from Dell, which confirms that Dell would not service the defective product.  This entire process is both frustrating and illogical. My purchase was from Amazon, and I bought a brand-new product. Why should I be responsible for visiting a Dell service center? If I wanted to rely on in-person service, I would have purchased the laptop from a physical outlet instead of Amazon.  This experience has been incredibly disappointing. I highly recommend against purchasing electronic items from Amazon. Their service has significantly declined, making it a frustrating experience for customers when dealing with defective products.",NEGATIVE

"I've got the ryzen 3 5000 series 8gb variant in july 2024  It has been 2 days of using it The built quality of my unit is intact,no damage or scratches so far since delivery  Coming from using IPS display in desktop and amoled in cellphone the screen quality of the laptop feels dull but knowing what i paid for and got,I'm ok with it. if anyone is planning to get this product they will get used to the display quality eventually  I haven't installed anything yet and feel it's bit laggy but I'm ok with it,as I don't play games and will use it for online work and other productive work which don't require that much memory(although RAM can be extended in this model), people should go for the 16gb ram varient if availability of ryzen 3 5000 is there,under 31k or less  Battery backup is about 3/4 hours of average usage, but more backup can be achieved according to usage patterns, adjusting screen brightness in a new unit as it gets older battery degradation will happen eventually as backup of the laptop  WiFi is working fine so far, haven't tried bluetooth function yet  Speaker is of average quality but on softer side,what i felt could have been a little louder  Keyboard is without backlit and responsive, if you have big hands and fingers then it might be an issue(buy an external keyboard and mouse)like me and this will solve the inconvenience and longevity of keyboard and trackpad of laptop  All the ports and jack are working fine  What i had seen in videos and reviews, i thought they will provide a 45watt charger but they have provided with 65 watt charger which charges quite fast, which is a plus point but still it takes about 2 hrs 10 min to fully charged from 7% to 100% in my case(with wifi/ bluetooth off and no apps running in background with 25 to 30% screen brightness)  It doesn't come with lifetime validity of MS office you have to buy after free trail period or find a cracked one from local computer stores  Overall you can buy the laptop if you are in a budget with decent built,fast charging,full HD screen and average performance under 27000 then go for it,you can also get it under 25000 during sale seasons using bank cards and exchange offers  In future I will update my review or post a comment if something unusual things come by with the laptop",NEGATIVE

Pros:  - Excellent performance - Ample storage and RAM - Sleek design - Great value for the price  Cons: None so far!",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop 6 months ago, and it stopped working. First, the screen failed, and later, the motherboard was found faulty. I raised a complaint on 15th January, but even after 15 days, the issue is unresolved. Delays in ordering parts and no updates from the service center make this experience even worse.  Terrible product and service. Highly disappointed!  Rating: 1/5",NEGATIVE
Best in budget Best in performance Best in quality Display is good,POSITIVE
"With this laptop, what you see is what you get. Nothing exceptional but still very solid. Decent build with a sturdy enough body, the screen hinge is a bit on the loose side so it does wobble a bit while moving it. In terms of performance the Ryzen 5 5625U is perhaps the best in the price range. You also get 16 gigs of ram as opposed to 8 gigs on most competitors. The fans are quite loud so if you're someone who wants a quiet, low profile laptop then be warned. Overall, very good value for price.",POSITIVE
"I received this laptop with open( teared amazon box) but since laptop was untampered I let it go. Firstly, this is my first laptop so I'll just type in my experience.

However, the lack of backlighting may be inconvenient for users who frequently work in low-light conditions. The touchpad is responsive and accurate, though the physical buttons may feel slightly stiff.  Display Quality The display quality depends on the panel type. The TN panel has limited viewing angles and lower brightness, making it less ideal for users who prioritize screen quality. The IPS panel, on the other hand, offers better color reproduction and wider viewing angles, making it the preferred choice.  Battery Life and Connectivity The HP 255 G9 offers decent battery life, lasting around 5-7 hours on typical usage, though this may vary based on workload and settings. In terms of connectivity, it includes USB-A and USB-C ports, an HDMI output, a headphone/microphone combo jack, and Wi-Fi 6 support for fast wireless connectivity.  Conclusion The HP 255 G9 is a reliable and budget-friendly laptop, well-suited for everyday computing, office tasks, and light multimedia use. Its upgradeable design ensures long-term usability, while the IPS display option significantly enhances the visual experience. However, users who work in low-light environments may find the lack of a backlit keyboard a drawback. Overall, it's a solid choice for those seeking an affordable, upgradable laptop for daily use.",POSITIVE
"I am extremely disappointed with my recent purchase of a laptop from Amazon. The laptop arrived faulty right out of the box, and despite contacting Amazon multiple times, I have received no proper technical support or resolution.  Each time I reached out, I was either redirected to different departments or given generic responses that did not address the issue. Even after repeatedly requesting a return or replacement, my concerns were ignored, leaving me stuck with a defective product and no solution in sight.  This experience has been incredibly frustrating, and I expected much better customer service from Amazon. I strongly advise potential buyers to think twice before purchasing expensive electronics from here, as their after-sales support is severely lacking.  Rating: 1/5 – Extremely dissatisfied.",NEGATIVE
"I’ve been using the HP 255 G9 for a few weeks now, and it has exceeded my expectations! For an entry-level business laptop, it packs a punch. The AMD Ryzen 3 3250U processor is surprisingly quick and handles all my daily tasks—email, browsing, word processing—without any issues. It boots up fast thanks to the 512 GB SSD, and with 8 GB of RAM, multitasking is smooth as well.  The 15.6-inch display is clear and bright, and the larger screen size is perfect for working with multiple tabs open at once. I also appreciate the matte black finish, which looks professional while still being durable and lightweight. At 1.47 kg, it’s easy to carry around between meetings or to a coffee shop for work.  The battery life is solid, lasting me around 6-8 hours depending on usage, which is perfect for a full workday. The laptop also runs quietly, and the performance of the AMD Radeon graphics is good for basic tasks—though I wouldn’t recommend it for intensive gaming or video editing.  Overall, the HP 255 G9 is a great choice if you’re looking for an affordable, reliable laptop for everyday business or personal use. It provides excellent value for the price, and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a no-fuss laptop for work or study.",POSITIVE
Great product at such affordability price,POSITIVE

"Amazing battery life, I had never seen such long battery backup in any windows laptop till now, maybe because of the ultra series 2 Lunar Lake processors , easily it can last a day (10+ hrs I get in mixed work). Great for creators as it comes with touch screen and integrated GPU performance is also good. Hardly I hear the fan noise during general tasks.",POSITIVE

"This laptop is highly recommended, because of its long lasting quality and value for money.... The only small downside is its battery backup, which is not more than 3 hours.",POSITIVE
Under budget this is a good laptop .,POSITIVE
Laptop is good to use... at first the installations took a long time but later it is good to use.... if windows 10 had support further would have installed in it... had to use performance options for best performance and increasing virtual memory a bit so it can run smooth... can use it for a daily regular light usage... battery is coming for 3-4hrs... if ur looking for a budget laptop means u can go for it....,NEGATIVE
Brought this laptop and it not working. Both Amazon and Leno wont take responsibility. Lenovo provides online support for which we need to do all task said by the agent. Lenovo technical can multiple times and could not solve the issue and put the blame on operating system.,NEGATIVE
"Even with an SSD which boots quickly into Windows, the cpu is just too weak to handle basic browsing and YouTube. Adequate for basic tasks, but prepare for painfully slow browsing with multiple tabs on Chrome. God forbid if you open YouTube, the screen and colors are just dull and too washed out.",NEGATIVE
It's found better in short cost,NEGATIVE
at this price it is very efficient and use full can do all my work quick and fast,POSITIVE
you have to pay 885 in the service center of lenovo for windows 11 in my product it does not come and I have to conform it from lenovo customer care. now I have been using it for like 3 5 days. First it's a 25000 laptop these days you don't get a good tablet in this price range so I am going to give my opinion based on it a great product if you just want to do a normal workload like ms work or chrome multitasking on YouTube it plays 2160 60 fps but screen is normal not so colourful vibrant etc but still the price so its a great product heating problem yes there is but room temperature is there and you can add a cool pad so normal disk space is less but upgradable sometime slow but still good conclusion it's a very good product I get a new one yes I seen some videos where there a lre two sticker of lenovo I asked engineer they say we have to check the product first then we will let it go to customer so not a big deal but check still so if you want a laptop 15.6 screen at this range you are good with some lag go for it it's not a bad product at all lenovo service center is also wonderful people but don't c9mplain for screen is not good I am not been able to play gta 5🤣🤣 it's just not for it,POSITIVE
"The overall experience was awesome,  I would rate 8.7 on a scale of 10.  The best parts of this laptop:  1. Display: 144hz smooth display 2. Keyboard: Backlit and best designed keyboard 3. Gaming experience: No lag as it comes with 16gb Ram and 4gb RTX Graphic card. 4. Transfer speed: The file transferred can be seen in an Image I've shared (C to C SSD). 5. Ports: All the needful ports are provided, RJ45 port is eisely fitted in! 6. Design: the laptop is designed so well, nice & attractive 7. Overall experience: Best piece available on this price range...  Some of things I didn't liked: 1. Screen Wobble. 2. Blue color is bit not good, black is preferable. 3. Battery life is max to max 3 hrs. of light-mid performance tasks. 4. The adapter is good and super fast charging speed type (200W) but its too heavy to carry. (Laptop weight is acceptable around 2.3kg).  I would heavily recommend:  Keep a cotton or thin cloth in between of screen and keyboard when you close your laptop, otherwise it will leave keyboard's dust spots on your screen which is not cleanable easily.  Thanks!",POSITIVE
"I had bought HP Victus Ryzen 5 series RTX3050 GPU laptop simply for my routine usage for office and other works, but this laptop is beast, doing best in gaming and other heavy task related works. Pros : 1.) Price. 2.) Premiumness. 3.) Performance. 4.) Top notch and lag free operation. 5.) Gaming in budget. Cons. 1.) No cons, except the Heat issues while gaming literally I got my lap baked 😂lol. Use laptop cooler. avoid using the laptop by keeping on bed or mattress it will block the air intake makes the laptop to heat.",NEGATIVE
"I’ve been using the HP Victus for a variety of tasks, including gaming, video editing, and basic office work, and overall, I’m impressed. Its gaming capability is excellent, handling demanding games like Red Dead Redemption 2 smoothly without any issues.  For a gaming laptop, the battery life is surprisingly good. The 70Wh battery lasts up to 4 hours when performing lighter tasks, which is more than I expected. The only downside is the sound quality, which is quite average, but that’s manageable if you’re using headphones or external speakers.  Overall, a solid choice for gamers and power users alike.",POSITIVE
"Its a gaming laptop but i can't install games, It shows black screen in a middle of work Works slow",NEGATIVE
I have Lenovo low series laptop but this laptop have awesome battery backup and its price also☺️. It cost me around 50740₹. In this price segment this is the best performance laptop I have ever seen . Some heavy games are smoothly run. Display quality is also good. Looks good... Sound quality is fine,POSITIVE
"After using this laptop for more than a year, here's my review:  Good laptop if you mostly want to play games, doing some heavy workload and/or occasionally some MS Office related stuff. But for me personally, it has got some issues.  The touchpad works fine for some time and then it's starts having input lag. Like, there's a noticeable delay between swiping the finger and mouse pointer moving on the screen. It's really annoying when I have to precisely click on small things.  The temporary soluton I got is, I disable and re-enable the touchpad using the hotkey on the keyboard. But it doesn't work forever, sometimes I have to do it again after a few seconds.  The build quality isn't that great either, especially the hinge.  If you live in a hot climate and have a fan blowing air from the side. The screen is going to wobble and steal your attention from whatever important stuff you might be doing.  And if the wobbling thing can't steal your precious attention, then probably the sparkly backlit keyboard would. Especially, if you place the laptop on table a little bit far away with lights off at night. It's bright and there's no option to dim it.  Also, If you're going to daily drive it to take it on work through public transport with the bag hanging on your shoulders for half an hour, then you're probably going to regret getting this 2.5 KG laptop.  Otherwise, the performance is great for a laptop for this price range.  TL;DR This laptop is good as a tabletop with an external mouse. Otherwise buy a desktop.",NEGATIVE
Only drawback is screen not being bright.,NEGATIVE
Nice and worth Battery low heat lvl high Smoothness Build quality good,POSITIVE
Value for money.,POSITIVE
"Processor is slightly slow but for this range and basic usage, it suffices! If you are thinking of multitasking too much with this, then you maybe dissatisfied",POSITIVE

"Product is Good & it’s really slim look wise awesome But problem is…  I purchased 2 times on 9th Jan and 14th Jan 2025, both times I got wrong product from same retailer, got only 474gb instead of SSD capacity 512gb How can same mistake happen 2nd time",NEGATIVE
This laptop key board light not working why,NEGATIVE
"have to pay for office, antivirus, battery backup is around 5 hours, touchpad is good , slim and beautiful design, slow processing",POSITIVE
"Very slow laptop don't by these laptop keyboard not functioning not,a light keypad this laptop basic nids good laptop,but best expectation then do not by these laptop 💻 , but these laptop plus point battery backup is very good 👍",POSITIVE
"I bought it for around Rs. 50k on January 2023 and it's the only laptop at that price range that provides 16gb ram along with 512gb SSD. The display is okay, not great. I am now seeing some lines inside the display, which keep in mind is after almost 2 years of purchase. The chipset and battery is pretty good for running the normal work stuff, but is not great for gaming. You can play some games in it, obviously with low graphics and it will run just fine. The battery will last for a day after a full charge if using just the office tools like excel or MS word. The sound system is okay, not something to praise about.",NEGATIVE
"Update: Now it is almost 2 years, working like brand new laptop. Looking into the specs i bought this laptop for study purpose, it has 6 Core with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and hopefully for multitasking purpose. Warranty of 1 year registered automatically during setup process and also latpop updated with latest windows 11 patches. Also received McAfee 1 year subscription within ₹199, It is good deal to protect laptop from threats. Didn't face any problems with laptop since 2 months of usage for study purpose. After Looking into build quality, Screen has good clarity, Laptop body made up of cheap quality plastic and it is very ductile and delicate; need to handle carefully; otherwise this is the good laptpop (not best) in this price range.  It Comes with Backlit keyboard and MS Office lifetime Student and Home and Mc afee One month free trail.  I used this laptop with laptop stand, so didn't face any performance Issue due to heating.  After 3 to 4 months usage, I am updating my review, didn't face any hardware problem at all, only issue I faced is windows 11 home edition which is very crap and post updating the patches it started troubling, windows power options disappear, shutdown and sleep and lock options disappear, even though we reinstall the windows 11, next day post updating windows again the same problem occurs, I did research on this issue and came to know that windows home edition has this problem and no solution yet provided by Microsoft, if you have enterprise edition then it works like charm.",NEGATIVE
Great packaging and top notch quality,POSITIVE

It hangs too much . Curser move on its on . This is worst ever product i got . Frustrated now .",NEGATIVE
Good pc in budget. Build is a bit cheap but performance is decent.,POSITIVE
BEST CONFIGURATION AT BEST PRICE. Working flawless even after month,POSITIVE
"Writing the review after using 3 days...  Pros:  Build Quality: The laptop boasts a solid build quality, ensuring durability and a premium feel. Speakers: The audio output is impressive, delivering clear and rich sound. Battery: Decent Battery Life 4:20 Mins on Medium Usage. Charging Speed: The 65W adaptor charges the laptop quickly.  Cons:  Display Quality: Unfortunately, the display quality is Worst, Even 20K/25K laptops got good Displays (It's strugling to Play the 4K video, even Amazon Prime Videos did'nt Played) Performance: Even though the 6 Cores & 12 thread AMD Ryzen 5 5500u is clocked @ 2.1 GHz, the performance is not up to the mark with noticeable lag (did'nt handled the 15+ Tabs in Chrome and got strucked)... My Lenovo 11the Gen i3 Laptop is far more better in performance than this laptop, may be it is not well-optimized Ports: The laptop is limited in connectivity options, offering only 2 USB-A ports and 1 USB-C port, which is restricted to data transfer only at this price range other laptops offering 2 USB Type C with Display & Charging Support. Privacy: There is no privacy shutter for the webcam, which might be a concern for privacy-conscious users.  Final Verdict: The Laptop is not for Multimedia Consumption/ Gaming/Video Editing..... Only If your looking a laptop just for programming/spreasheet work/Trading.. Buy it / else / please avoid..",NEGATIVE
"We recently had a terrible experience with an Amazon order, and I want to warn others before they make the same mistake. We ordered what I thought was a new laptop, but what arrived was a completely different, old laptop. Mistakes happen, so I initiated a return. That's where the real nightmare began.  The return process started, but it was suddenly stopped without any explanation. Now Amazon has the incorrect laptop AND our money, and they've refused to take any further action to resolve the issue. It's incredibly frustrating and feels like our money was just stolen. I've contacted customer service multiple times, and the outcome has been nothing but silence or unhelpful responses.  To anyone considering purchasing this item (or presumably any item from Amazon India), be aware that you’re taking a big risk. Your money could end up disappearing, and there seems to be no guarantee of getting what you paid for or even being able to return a product that isn’t right. Amazon’s handling of this situation was disappointing and borderline unethical.  And for those who do decide to take the gamble and buy it, just a heads-up: after about a year of use, the hinge on the laptop breaks. It happened to many others we previously ordered, and while it might not seem like a huge deal, it really makes the laptop hard to use.  Bottom line – be very cautious. If you’re unlucky, you might end up with no product and no money. Buyer beware.",NEGATIVE
"In 2025 if it comes under 50k then you can blindly go for it. I got it for 57k in dec 2024.  Size is little bit small.  Keyboard feels nice to type, UI is also very smooth to use, speaker quality and display is awesome, Battery backup is mind-blowing, it will easily last you for two days under normal use , performance is also very good.  It has strong alluminium body which is very sturdy, you can also open it with one hand.  Functionality wise I would say little bit poor because it only has 2 usb c port and one headphone jack that's it.",POSITIVE
"The Apple MacBook Air M1 is an absolute game-changer. From performance to battery life, this laptop excels in every category. Powered by the M1 chip, it delivers lightning-fast processing speeds, whether you're multitasking with several apps or handling more intensive tasks like video editing. The fanless design ensures it runs silently, making it perfect for quiet environments like libraries or meetings.  The battery life is phenomenal, lasting over 15 hours on a single charge, which makes it incredibly reliable for long workdays or travel. The Retina display is crisp, vibrant, and sharp, offering stunning visuals for creative work and media consumption. Plus, the build quality is top-notch, featuring Apple's signature sleek and lightweight design.  What stands out the most is how smoothly macOS Big Sur operates on the M1 chip. Apps open instantly, and the overall user experience feels fluid and seamless. Even legacy apps that run through Rosetta 2 show no lag, making this an easy transition from Intel-based Macs.  For anyone looking for an ultra-portable, powerful, and efficient laptop, the MacBook Air M1 is unbeatable. I highly recommend it for professionals, students, or casual users alike. Five stars all the way!",POSITIVE
"1. Performance: The M1 MacBook Air is incredibly fast and efficient. The M1 chip's performance is on par with or even surpasses many Intel-based MacBook Pros, making it one of the most powerful laptops in its class. Whether you're a casual user, a creative professional, or a developer, it handles most tasks with ease.  2. Battery Life: One of the standout features of the M1 MacBook Air is its impressive battery life. Users report getting 12-15 hours of real-world use, which is a significant improvement over previous Intel-based MacBook Air models. You can go an entire workday or more without needing to charge it.  3. Fanless Design: The M1 MacBook Air is fanless, which means it operates silently. This is a big plus for those who value a quiet working environment.  4. Portability: The MacBook Air remains one of the most portable laptops on the market. It's lightweight, slim, and has a high-quality Retina display. Its build quality is top-notch.  5. Compatibility: The transition from Intel to Apple's M1 architecture meant some software might not be immediately compatible. However, Apple has made substantial progress in optimizing and making software compatible with the M1, including popular applications and operating systems.  6. Rosetta 2: Apple's Rosetta 2 technology allows older Intel-based apps to run on the M1 Macs, and it does so quite efficiently. Still, some applications may not be as optimized or as fast as native M1 apps.  7. Price: The M1 MacBook Air offers excellent value for the performance you get, especially when compared to some Intel-based MacBooks.  8. Integrated Graphics: The integrated GPU in the M1 chip is impressive and can handle a range of tasks, including photo and video editing. However, if you're a professional video editor or a gamer, you might want to consider a MacBook Pro with dedicated graphics.  9. Limited Port Selection: The MacBook Air features only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. This could be a limitation if you need more ports.  10. Upgradability: The M1 MacBook Air is not user-upgradable. So, you'll need to choose the right configuration at the time of purchase.",POSITIVE
"The Apple MacBook Air with M1 chip is fast, efficient, and ideal for everyday tasks and light creative work. Its 13.3-inch Retina display is sharp and vibrant, while the battery lasts an impressive 15+ hours. The fanless, lightweight design makes it silent and highly portable. Overall, it offers superb performance, a premium build, and excellent value.",POSITIVE
"After a long search, I finally purchased the MBA M1, and it has easily been one of the best purchase decisions I've ever made. First of all, the form factor is simply stunning. It's incredibly easy to carry around in a sleeve or a backpack. There are no vents or fans, which makes it incredibly quiet and sleek. The display is gorgeous, the keyboard is fantastic, the trackpad is amazing, the speakers sound great, and the overall build quality is exceptional. Last but not least, the star of the show is the M1 processor and the battery. The M1 chip is incredibly powerful and efficient, resulting in exceptional performance and battery life. If your essential software runs on macOS, the M1 MacBook Air is a no-brainer",POSITIVE

Cons:  - Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check. - Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.

"I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition. Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.  Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)  The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.  The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.  Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.",NEGATIVE
"Hi guys, Here is my review after using this laptop.  Laptop pro's - Design, price and performance.  Laptop design - This laptop's design feels premium and nice.  Laptop performance - It can handle GTA 5 smoothly. Also can record gameplay.  Laptop thermals - Laptop gets hot only during gaming. But it doesn't over heat as far as I used.  Laptop con's - I noticed some bugs/glitches like cursor while using in typing area or text box it gets white or kinda invisible I feel this maybe a bug.  -Screen goes off for a second sometimes while playing videos or browsing especially in battery power.  -Blue screen error: I have faced blue screen error two times till now while switching from power mode to battery mode(plugging out adapter).",NEGATIVE

"This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc... Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful. Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card. Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a ""battery care mode"" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!

"I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpad",POSITIVE
"Nice compact laptop. Decent built quality. Perfect for students, office use . MS Office home edition avaliable. Overall decent product in this category.",POSITIVE
This is hands down the most well configured laptop in this price range. The best thing is that this laptop has DDR5 RAM and the latest generation of AMD 7000 series processor. However would have preferred support for Gen 2 USB Type C for faster and more convenient charging options. The installed m.2 ssd is slower than some of the options available in this price range. Light gaming is very much possible with tweaking the system but it's not recommended as this laptop wasn't built with such scenarios in mind. Overall a very good option for a work and light entertainment oriented laptop in a tight budget.,POSITIVE
"The orders was delivered on the same delevery day and best for normal, and for lower rendering games. Overall best for business and home purpose.",NEGATIVE
Volume of speakers are very low and rest all is ok as on this price.,POSITIVE

"Reviewing after 1 month of usages!! First I'm confused about this laptop because of the negative review ,it's a great laptop for basic use & for professionals. Pros- -The build quality is good 👍🏻, - the design is very sleek smooth - keyboard quality and keys are good, ☺️ -Processor is beast very much satisfied , -Battery life is also average max 4 hr to 5 hr depends on usages , - lenovo service is so good I can say cause I noticed that my touchpad is sometimes lagging(coz of BIOS not uptodate) so I connect with the support team in lenovo offical website , he fixed it in just 10 mins! ☺️  CONS - Brightness is bit low have to set in 80 to100 range - speaker sound is average! - while charging the heating issue felt but not very much - only 60hrz refresh rate not satisfied - sometimes display wombling not much but little - backlit light is dim. Overall it'a good laptop ♥️ 4.5/5 If your priority is not gaming or editing then you can go for it! 👍🏻",POSITIVE
Almost using it for 5 days :-  Pros :- 👍👍 .) Build quality💥 .) Display worth the money .) Battery life - I got 7.5 hrs with normal usage ( offline movies + YouTube + Browsing + Pdf reading) with Wifi and Bluetooth turned on all the time...I kept brightness at 30% ( since It is sufficient for me in indoors ) and in dark mode... Another time I got only 5.5 hrs of battery life...so not sure of the exact battery span. .) Flip to start is very useful .) Booting time is only 10-15 secs max .) Performance is good for this budget .) Light weight and very convenient to use especially for studying  Cons :- 👎👎 .) Heating issue while charging😮‍💨 .) Sometimes it heats up even with normal usage .) Speaker is good but sound is low .) Missing fingerprint sensor/Facial recognition in this range  Tips :- .) Don't charge immediately after using for more hours...let the heat to cool down and then charge .) After charging let the heat to cool down..then start to use ( will Increase battery span )  Product got delivered b4 the due date...and packaging was good 👍  Conclusion : Simply go for it if you are a student and doesn't play that much of games💥,NEGATIVE

"I bought this laptop few days back. There was an issue with the screen so I had to return/replace it. The amazon guys has been lying from start. They said they were going to initiate a lenovo technician visit. I waited for 2 days, no one came so I called lenovo directly. They said they had no notification regarding any booking of technician visit.  Once I booked the technician visit in lenovo's side a visit was arranged. In the meantime amazon kept telling me that their hands are tied as long as the product is not sealed by lenovo. Once lenoco technician checks the project and gives no objection for return we will return/replace it immediately. Now it has been almost 2 weeks, everyday a return is created and gets cancelled saying the product was not ready when actually no one visited.  My biggest mistake was to buy it from amazon. The laptop is actually good. But directly from lenovo or may ve croma.",NEGATIVE
"It's very slim , The build is plastic but it's very tough , the display is FHD and it's a good display, The processer is actually a beast but you need to use it on charging to utilise it's full capacity , battery backup despite of having a H series processor and 48W Battery it performs very well and give you a 5hr screen on time the sound isn't too loud but if you keep it on your lap or so then you won't face any issue , And the main keypoint of this laptop is it's i7 13gen processor which is very very powerful but remember it has a intel UHD graphics so you are not going to play any graphics involving games it won't be a smooth experience overall a good product for real",NEGATIVE
"First of all thanks to Amazon for the fastest deliveries less than 24 hours with good shape. Now on the laptop front superb finish love at first sight, it is a clean laptop with all the essential features. Top lid is of metal a premium quality laptop with precise cut at each and every corner. It is a 12th Generation i5 - 12450H processor laptop due to which no issues at the processing of task no matter what you give, it run as a breeze, no fingerprint sensor, no graphics card it had a internal graphics card which is terrible if you want this laptop for gaming purpose then do not purchase this. I have purchased this as i have no use of graphics card.  Pros:  ASPECT RATIO: 16:10 ( Major highlight which is helpful in Coding ) SCREEN : IPS Panel with 60Hz resolution with good viewing angle. CHARGER: 65 Watt Charger with USB type C FRONT CAM: 720p with privacy shutter. SSD: 500 GB (with upgradable option) TRACK PAD : Very nice wide and smooth scroll with good tactile feedback. BACKLITE KEYBOARD : YES  Cons:  RAM: 16 GB ( not upgradable this is a major downside of this laptop which is so expensive) HDD: ( no slot for HDD ) FINGERPRINT : NO GRAPHICS CARD: Inbuilt  HEATING ISSUE:  Most important due to which I gave it a less rating since Lenovo knows it is a H series processor therefore vents should be cut out at the side end of the laptop but at present the vent is at the screen & bottom end due to which when performing high priority tasks it becomes hot as it is clocked at base 2.0 Ghz the keyboard area becomes hot and due to vents placed at screen side screen & metal lid becomes hot not that much hot but still a premium laptop Ideapad 5 series should not have this kind of issues. During benchmark test the keyboard area becomes serious hot and the screen area the right bottom area becomes hot due to vent throwing air at the screen.",NEGATIVE
"Good stuff - The screen: Pretty good brightness with good viewing angles, decent IPS panel. I use my laptops at 100% brightness, seems decent. - The specs: 12450H & DDR5 RAM does a great job, even the SSDs are decent. Boot time is around 2 secs.  Average stuff: -Build quality: The lid is metal, however the rest is generic Acer plastic. Feels cheap at certain areas especially the webcam privacy shutter (check image). - Keyboard/touchpad: Kinda okayish, not great, not garbage either. Do note the keyboard is not backlit (didn't notice this myself). - Battery: Lasts 2.45 hours at full brightness and moderate tasks. - Gen 3.0 ports, and just one type C port. But you get a micro sd card slot if that's important to you.  Verdict: I believe in price to performance ratio, got this at 37k (no exchange) and at that price this is genuinely VFM deal! Do consider this laptop under 42k only!",NEGATIVE
"I am sharing this post after using this laptop for 4 days. This is an amazing device with state-of-the-art technological features. upper body is metallic and durable. However, it feels like plastic and lower is plastic. Overall physical appearance is appealing. weight is ok and easy to carry in bag. There is no doubt about the performance of this device whether it is used for home or office. I can't say anything about gaming here because I am not very much fond of. Battery drains in 4 hours approximately in normal use. My concern is about the orientation of some key buttons like right shift button is small as compared to left. power button could be placed little bit upper side as it sometimes hit accidently while using del button. sound quality is average, but it can be improved with the following method. 1. open Realtek audio console 2. click on speakers 3. Turn on omni speakers 4. Set equalizer to rock or powerful mode. The above setting will definitely improve sound quality. The blue indicator lights are sometimes annoying specially using while night. it should be on the right or left lower edge of the device. it is small issue but should not be overlooked. I rectified covering those with translucent sticker. All in all, it is a great budget deal in this festive sale. Certainly, go for it. Thanks",POSITIVE
I write this review after a week. Pros 1. 12450H processor is really fast 2. Low Price (bought at 35k) 3. Display is stunning 4. Battery is long lasting (7 ~ 9 hours) 5. inbuilt MS Office 2021 life long version 6. many USB ports and and sim card port (though you might not use it) 7. Touchpad is really large and comfortable to use  Cons 1. Speaker is worst. cant use it to watch movies / attend Video calls without external speakers/microphones 2. The keypad could be much better though backlight is available 3. Webcam quality is not that good 4. Poor Graphics card. not for Game lovers  Very good purchase for Office use. And simple games and softwares can be used without any trouble.  I am much happier with this purchase at this price. Thanks Amazon,NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased this laptop, attracted by its impressive configuration at a competitive price. It boasts a powerful processor, ample RAM, and a fast SSD, making multitasking, and even demanding software run smoothly. For anyone looking for solid performance, it's hard to find a better option in this price range.  However, the build quality leaves much to be desired. The plastic casing feels flimsy, and the hinges seem weak and prone to wear over time. After just a few days of use, I've noticed slight creaking noises, and the keyboard flexes more than I'd like during typing. The trackpad also feels a bit quirky, which is frustrating during long work sessions.  In short, if you're after performance and can overlook the subpar build quality, this laptop delivers. But for those who need a durable machine that feels sturdy and reliable, this may not be the best choice..",NEGATIVE
"I bought this laptop few weeks ago and i have been enjoying it a little too much. It's perfect for almost everything. I've been taking it to work and the battery lasts for 6 hours easily for me (I just use Google sheets) even if I have to watch YouTube, the battery is amazing. And the display is beautiful I tried to look for flaws in this laptop but there aren't any. I even played valorant and it gives around 120-150 fps without v-sync and 60fps with it on (on low graphics) and I haven't really played other games but I'm positive it can handle it. Apart from that it's a metal body and it's not that heavy for daily travelling. And yeah the camera is pretty decent too. And the touch pad is spacious. Overall, I absolutely love this laptop and it's worth EVERY PENNY. OH AND IT'S VERY GOOD AT MULTITASKING! Bro if you're still not convinced idk what you want XD",POSITIVE
"Its an average laptop with good display and a 4,5 hours battery life. Amd also super build and good speed of i5 With 526GB storage.",POSITIVE
It is good laptop dedicated for work use. It is not for gaming. Display quality is 2k resolution. Sound is nice. It is giving enough battery backup. Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.,POSITIVE
"Using it for a month and a half Pros: 16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder. Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators), Lightweight, easy and fast. Drawbacks: audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me). definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap) no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1) the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)  Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.",NEGATIVE
It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid,POSITIVE
"I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution. When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well. This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity. Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences. I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.",NEGATIVE
Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.,POSITIVE
Speed-5 star Looks-5 star Cons- very less Usb ports and no LAN port Overall best choice.,NEGATIVE
"My personal review: 1.Performance(Ram-16gb) Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily. If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily as well) but instead want a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop. 2. Display The display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well). 3.Battery Battery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range) 4.Sound Sound quality is also good and clear . Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me. 5.Heating Personally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me. Final Review - If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.",POSITIVE
"Most irritating part of this laptop is its battery backup. Its charges pretty quickly and it also discharges pretty quickly. The battery backup is really poor compared to some of the other brands. Also, during charging the touchpad is often difficult to control.",NEGATIVE
"Pros:-Offer better product compare to other companies in same price. Smooth functioning, good battery life, processor performed well, hd screen gives soothing effect to eyes, very comfortable keypad. Cons-company should provide a laptop bag",POSITIVE
"I've got the ryzen 3 5000 series 8gb variant in july 2024  It has been 2 days of using it The built quality of my unit is intact,no damage or scratches so far since delivery  Coming from using IPS display in desktop and amoled in cellphone the screen quality of the laptop feels dull but knowing what i paid for and got,I'm ok with it. if anyone is planning to get this product they will get used to the display quality eventually  I haven't installed anything yet and feel it's bit laggy but I'm ok with it,as I don't play games and will use it for online work and other productive work which don't require that much memory(although RAM can be extended in this model), people should go for the 16gb ram varient if availability of ryzen 3 5000 is there,under 31k or less  Battery backup is about 3/4 hours of average usage, but more backup can be achieved according to usage patterns, adjusting screen brightness in a new unit as it gets older battery degradation will happen eventually as backup of the laptop  WiFi is working fine so far, haven't tried bluetooth function yet  Speaker is of average quality but on softer side,what i felt could have been a little louder  Keyboard is without backlit and responsive, if you have big hands and fingers then it might be an issue(buy an external keyboard and mouse)like me and this will solve the inconvenience and longevity of keyboard and trackpad of laptop  All the ports and jack are working fine  What i had seen in videos and reviews, i thought they will provide a 45watt charger but they have provided with 65 watt charger which charges quite fast, which is a plus point but still it takes about 2 hrs 10 min to fully charged from 7% to 100% in my case(with wifi/ bluetooth off and no apps running in background with 25 to 30% screen brightness)  It doesn't come with lifetime validity of MS office you have to buy after free trail period or find a cracked one from local computer stores  Overall you can buy the laptop if you are in a budget with decent built,fast charging,full HD screen and average performance under 27000 then go for it,you can also get it under 25000 during sale seasons using bank cards and exchange offers  In future I will update my review or post a comment if something unusual things come by with the laptop",NEGATIVE
"I received my Acer Aspire laptop yesterday, and I'm thrilled with its performance so far! With 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, this laptop is a beast. The AMD Ryzen 5-5625U processor handles multitasking with ease.  The laptop's build quality is solid, and it looks sleek. I've been using it for general productivity, browsing, and it's handled everything seamlessly.  Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. The Acer Aspire offers incredible value for its price. If you're in the market for a reliable and powerful laptop, I highly recommend considering this one!  Pros:  - Excellent performance - Ample storage and RAM - Sleek design - Great value for the price  Cons: None so far!",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop 6 months ago, and it stopped working. First, the screen failed, and later, the motherboard was found faulty. I raised a complaint on 15th January, but even after 15 days, the issue is unresolved. Delays in ordering parts and no updates from the service center make this experience even worse.  Terrible product and service. Highly disappointed!  Rating: 1/5",NEGATIVE
Best in budget Best in performance Best in quality Display is good,POSITIVE
"With this laptop, what you see is what you get. Nothing exceptional but still very solid. Decent build with a sturdy enough body, the screen hinge is a bit on the loose side so it does wobble a bit while moving it. In terms of performance the Ryzen 5 5625U is perhaps the best in the price range. You also get 16 gigs of ram as opposed to 8 gigs on most competitors. The fans are quite loud so if you're someone who wants a quiet, low profile laptop then be warned. Overall, very good value for price.",POSITIVE
"I received this laptop with open( teared amazon box) but since laptop was untampered I let it go. Firstly, this is my first laptop so I'll just type in my experience.  It is lagging even to run prince of Persia ( which is a small game,) ..  Also there are constant lags even which doing simple stuff on this laptop.  There seems to a problem, it takes a minute to wake up from sleep mode and power button keeps blinking....I think it's an issue  The VRAM is 512 MB .... Please take my advice and don't buy this  Battery doesn't last well...it comes to 30% with only 3 hours of usage, but since it has a fast charger it gets charged quickly.  There is no backlit keyboard, and screen is worse... it'll have to be at a certain angle to view things clearly.  performance is good ( as I only used ms edge so far, yet I experienced lags while closing and adding new Tabs. I'll update more with time.  I",NEGATIVE

"No doubt it's the best laptop for students under 40,000. You can use it for study purposes as well as for coding in college you can do code on it. You can play GTA v on low setting but it's not recommend as it's not a gaming laptop.  Pros:- 1. I3 1215u processor is pretty good for day to day task and it can also be used in programming.  2. Comes with a 2level backlit keyboard.  3. Display is also quite good.  Cons:-  I don't found such.  Overall it's best option under 40,000.",POSITIVE
"Hp is a bogus company, this is what I learned after purchasing this laptop. I have Sony Vaio laptop which I purchased in 2011 which have battery care function, which stops battery charging at either 50% or 80% and runs laptop on direct AC power, which in turn extend lifetime of battery. My battery is still good even after more than 12 years of using laptop. I know that well established laptop companies have this feature present in their laptop. Ex. Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, etc. (Not the new laptop companies.). So, I presumed that hp would also have this feature, but after I owned this laptop, I came to know that this crucial feature is absent. And only some of the hp laptop models have this feature. I am very disappointed ☹️. Because when laptop runs on battery power, it's performance is not good.  This laptop's keyboard is also so much bogus and stupid. The clicks are good and also the quality seems good, but the visibility of the text on keyboard is very bad. I use laptop mostly on my study table, and this silvery keyboard's keys text is invisible to read. I have to lean forward to see what's on it. (I think after some time I will get used to it, but as a beginner user of this laptop, it's too much hassle to use this keyboard).  I also have hp gaming mouse that I purchased recently whose back and forward side buttons are of bad build quality. And also I have one bad experience about HP pendrive. Also I have heard about HP printers' bad reputation.  So, I have now decided to never buy any hp company product.",NEGATIVE

"Recently purchased the HP laptop during the Great India Festival sale, and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations. The build quality is top-notch, with a sleek design that is both stylish and durable. The performance is incredible—thanks to its powerful processor and 12GB RAM, it handles multitasking effortlessly and runs all my applications smoothly. The display is vibrant and anti glare, making both work and entertainment a joy. Battery life is excellent, lasting me 4-5 hrs of heavy use which is quite better compare to other laptop in this segmenr.

"The HP 255 G10 with the Ryzen 5 processor is a notable upgrade from the G9 series, offering more robust performance and making it a solid choice for users seeking a budget-friendly laptop capable of handling more demanding tasks.  For those looking for a well-rounded, affordable laptop, the HP 255 G10 Ryzen 5 delivers solid performance for daily computing, multitasking, and light media editing. It is particularly suitable for students, remote workers, and anyone needing a reliable machine for office tasks, light productivity, and entertainment.  Design and Build Quality  The HP 255 G10 features a functional and durable design with a plastic construction. While it lacks the premium feel of higher-end HP models like the EliteBook, it compensates with good durability for its price point. The laptop is lightweight and portable, making it easy to carry for daily use.  Specifications and Price  I purchased the HP 255 G10 in January 2025 for around Rs. 32,000. At this price range, it is one of the few laptops offering 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, providing excellent value for money.  Display  The display is adequate but not exceptional. It serves well for regular tasks but may not appeal to users seeking high-quality visuals for gaming or content creation.  Performance  Equipped with the AMD Ryzen 5 processor, the HP 255 G10 strikes a good balance between performance and affordability. It handles multitasking, browsing, and office applications smoothly. While it is not ideal for gaming, it can run some games at low graphics settings without significant issues.  Battery Life  The battery performance is dependable, lasting for a full day on a single charge when using office tools like Excel or MS Word. However, more intensive tasks may drain the battery faster.  Sound System  The sound system is functional but unremarkable. While it suffices for basic usage, it may not deliver the quality expected by audiophiles or users prioritizing audio performance.  Overall Assessment  The HP 255 G10 Ryzen 5 is an entry-level laptop designed for everyday computing tasks, business use, and educational purposes. It offers a reliable and budget-friendly option for users who need a capable machine for typical productivity workloads. While it is not suited for gaming or heavy content creation, it provides an excellent balance of price and performance for general use.",POSITIVE
"I recently bought the HP 255 G10 with the AMD Ryzen 5 7520U processor, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase! Here's why:  Performance: The Ryzen 5 processor is super fast and handles everything I throw at it, from browsing to multitasking with multiple tabs open. It can even handle light photo editing and casual video editing without lag, which is impressive for this price range.  Display: The 15.6-inch screen is large enough for working on documents, watching videos, and even some casual gaming. The matte finish is a nice touch because it reduces glare and is easy on the eyes, especially during long hours of use.  Build Quality: The Matt Silver finish looks sleek and professional. The laptop feels sturdy without being too heavy, weighing just 1.35 kg, which is perfect for carrying around to meetings and coffee shops.  Storage and Speed: With 8 GB of RAM and a 512 GB SSD, it boots up quickly and has plenty of room for all my files. Apps launch with no noticeable delays, and the SSD makes a big difference compared to traditional hard drives.  Battery Life: Battery life is decent, lasting me a solid 5 hours depending on my usage, which is great for a day’s work.  Overall, for the price, this is an excellent laptop that performs really well for day-to-day tasks. If you're looking for something that combines performance, portability, and a good build, this is a great choice.",POSITIVE

The display isn't great but good and does the job fairly well. Colours are more or less accurate. Ryzen 3 7000 series along with DDR5 RAM does the trick. It's snappy most of the times, can work on 5 different spreadsheets, word docs and other MS office apps at the same time. Good for causal programming too.

"Within 3 months the battery got damaged and replaced under warranty. But again after 2 months the Keyboard and trackpad got complaints. Many keys are not working. Trackpad not responding. I tried to contact the service centre but no response from them yet. I have respect for my hard earned money spend on this product. That's the only reason I am not smashing it on ground.  Positive side is light weight and windows pre-installed. It's okay product for kids and students for OCCASIONAL use. But if the brand can take care of these little faults there is a huge potential for this product.  This is not a daily use product. No matter how you care, it will damage within warranty period.  Replacement is not a good choice for this laptop. Return is best option.  I will update once my review if the company willing to respond to my queries.  UPDATE: The company is a pain in the ass. They are very unprofessional as they are irresponsible. They will test your patient and give hell of you approach them for warranty claim.  BEST OPTION: Don't buy this laptop even if it is cheaper it is IT WORTH money. Spend some ten thousand rupees extra and go for a quality branded product.  Period.",NEGATIVE
"Updates on 25th October - The keyboard issues started - many keys doesn't work, no response from the support, no acknowledgement of the email sent. This is where we find difficult in the new companies and Amazon must look into this type issues.  Purchased on 29th June 2023 I don't find a dislike since 10 - 14 days using this product at this price. My niece is happy to have it. Battery backup is good, have tested myself, 50% went upto 2 hours. Windows is activated by the manufacturers and thus only had to run the new updates only. Hope it gives a good service in the future, Some preloaded files were there at the document folder - hope it was some part of ghost file to upload windows.  The only thing for this generic branding I think is to handle with care - 1. Always charge properly - ie do not let it go down below 18% and also do not overcharge. 2. Always do keep a wooden platform underneath while using on bed, it do not have exhaust fan on CPU.  Overall, a one can go for this for low end usage.  Thanks to the seller.",NEGATIVE

Good Laptop for Small / Medium work....,POSITIVE
Excellent laptop!,POSITIVE
Great Product at great price,POSITIVE
"Perfect in all aspects. Display is amazing, FHD. Sound quality is Dolby. Battery runs for 4-5 hours on full brightness. Screen brightness is high, feels more than 250 nits sometimes. Built quality gives premium look and feel. Light weight, high speed performance, fast internet connectivity. Only issue is little bit of heating that is because the vent is given just below the keyboard and when we place it on flat surface the vent gets blocked which causes a bit heating but that is not much to worry about. I'm completely satisfied with my decision to buy this product. They keyboard is of grey colour and its prettier than the black one.",POSITIVE
"I am a normal user after one months of observation i found speed is goog, in power saving mode u can use 6-7 hours, sound quality is good, screen quality also normal, display is ok. After sometimes of using its getting heat i think its normal in every electrical equipment but here need more improvement in this case. After all i think its a good product in this price specially students can go with this laptop. I am satisfy with this thankyou...",POSITIVE
"Brilliant product  Most of the configurations available in this price range (less than 40k) were either 4 GB RAM or 1 TB HDD  My base requirement was 8 GB RAM as Win 10 just doesn't work with 4 GB and going for aftermarket RAM on a new laptop did not make sense  Second requirement was SSD. I needed anything at or beyond 256 GB  Third requirement was latest generation of processor, 10th Gen in this case  Fourth requirement that kind of became mandatory after I was doing the diligence was MS Office preinstalled. Again, why go for aftermarket installation. Note: lot of people complain that this is only for 30 days. That's not the case. I activated just by signing in and updating Office.  The only other competition to this is Lenovo in similar price bracket, but it has a poor camera. With all the online classes and office, you can't look like crap just because you have a camera dating back to 2000s. All else are either expensive, do not have SSD, do not have 8 GB RAM or MS Office.  The screen could have been better, but I have a 29 inch LG screen so no complaints.  I missed checking if the swivel opens 180 degrees and this laptop doesn't open 180 degrees, so if you do use dual monitor then you have to place adjacent to additional monitor  Very satisfied till now. Boot time with SSD is awesome, the system boots in under 10 seconds.  Although it says 1.47 kg it feels a tad heavier. I have been using Mac but that's twice the price.  I wish there were more USB ports, it has 2 USB and 1 C type  This is default choice in the specs/ requirements so best buy",NEGATIVE
"Super product by HP. Got this HP 14s cf3047tu at Rs 35990 on great indian sale. Awesome Performance! Writing this review after 1 week of usage... Here is the detailed review of the product..  Battery backup is impressive. If you are not a heavy user it can last for a day. ( 9/10 )  Performance wise it's a beast.. with 8GB of ram, i3 10th gen processor and SSD storage you will not face any problem related to speed and performance. Windows boots in just 6-7 seconds. The software or apps takes max of 3 seconds to load... I have not faced any lagging issue till now. ( just avoid high end softwares and games and your laptop will work like a charm ) (10/10 )  Display is also good... I don't know why people are complaining about it. Also bezels are not too thick as in dell vostro and others. (8/10)  Looks are also decent with patterned surface which feels amazing to fingers and also provides a good grip. (8/10)  Sound is AWESOME! at 100% volume it feels like i am playing music over a Speaker... It is really loud. You'll have to keep volume at 40-50% for general use. You'll not get any other laptop with this sound quality at this price. Really! (10/10)  Camera is Average or you can say good for video calling purposes... As you don't have to take selfies with it.  So finally, This laptop is good in every feature. A power packed machine by HP. You will not get any other laptop with this type of performance, speed, sound and battery for this amazing price. Better than vivobook 14, vostro and ideapad series. Just Go For It! Overall rating 9/10.  (you also get a lifetime version of MS Office 2019 home & student - powerpoint, word, excel & one note which comes preinstalled with it that is you just have to sign in with ms account in any of the application and you will unlock the office suit)  Also a big thanks to Amazon. They delivered it within 2 days of ordering.  - vivek 😊",POSITIVE

Laptop is good but price is little high according to features they provided. * Display is average * No backlit keyboard * Charging is fast * Received 2 or 3 software updates in 15 days. * Sound quality is good * Performance is ok but do not expect too much. * Good for students and normal office work * No laptop bag included * Build quality is medium not sturdy * No 180 degree hinge. * Full size keyboard  Note- Amazon customer care gave me wrong information about the product details twice before purchasing it.,NEGATIVE

"For the price, the build quality is decent. Performance of the Ryzen5 processor is decent, definitely not at the level of the i5's. The screen quality is the weakest link here, too much screen whitewash, not able to get the color calibration right. My 2018 Asus laptop has better screen quality. Overall it is a decent buy for regular office use.",POSITIVE
"Good specifications, lots of RAM and storage for the price. Its good for basic everyday usage and has a decent display.",POSITIVE
"It is an amazing laptop for this price range it offers a great performance, does miss the backlit keyboard also there is some cost cutting for the screen colour combination for the lower variants. But the quality it gives is just premium it's a great laptop for college going students/ for programming.",POSITIVE
Who can imagine a 57k laptop without backlit keyboard in 2023? Not expected from ASUS atleast. It has reduced the saleability of an otherwise brilliant laptop.,NEGATIVE

"I have recently purchased a refurbished Dell Latitude 5400 with an Intel Core i5 Mobile 8th Gen Processor from Amazon, and it exceeded my expectations! The laptop arrived in excellent condition, with solid performance and great battery life. It handles multitasking seamlessly and feels almost like new. The packaging was secure, and setup was quick with pre-installed Windows. Syntronic Official, the seller, did an outstanding job with timely shipping, clear communication, and a well-refurbished product. Overall, a fantastic deal! Highly recommend both the laptop and Syntronic Official. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",POSITIVE

Equipped with an 8th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, this machine delivers impressive performance for my everyday tasks and light gaming in 2024..

"I work from home, and I needed a stand that is light, sturdy, and portable. I have repurchased the product. The six angles provide the angle depending on different needs. It a worth every penny for me.",POSITIVE
"Laptop Elevation Stand Review  The laptop elevation stand offers excellent elevation, providing a comfortable viewing angle that greatly reduces strain on the neck and shoulders. Its lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, which is perfect for people who move between workspaces or need something portable.  For work-related tasks and media consumption, this stand works wonderfully. The elevated height helps with ergonomics, and it’s perfect for watching videos or attending online meetings. However, I’m not entirely sure if it’s ideal for gaming, as it doesn’t seem to have features specifically designed for cooling or long gaming sessions.  One concern is the durability of the grips on the holders. They work well initially to keep the laptop stable, but I’m not sure what the solution is if they wear out over time. It would be great if there were some guidance on how to replace or maintain these parts for long-term use.  Overall, it's a solid stand for general use, but there might be some doubts regarding its longevity and performance for more intense activities like gaming.",POSITIVE
It's a good product don't worry about the size because when I first opened it I thought it will break as it appears small in size than my laptop but it works perfectly fine and handles the weight of my laptop the quality is very good I will say it is value for money overall its a good product 👍,POSITIVE
"Perfect sturdy item, get the job done. Not very heavy, so it's easy to carry around",POSITIVE
"Inaccurate color, i orderedspace grey received some weird mix of blue and grey, definitely not space grey. The high adjustment is also not precisely done. We have to push the extensions sideways to properly fall into the height adjustment. Stability is ok and rubbers are good",NEGATIVE
"Lightweight, and quality also good. It successfully fulfills my need for the height adjustment of my laptop screen for eye level and I feel it's value for money",POSITIVE
Nice Product. Easy to use and sturdy.,POSITIVE
"Good, good material, easy to carry, price need to be 250",POSITIVE
Very cheap and flimsy. I have another one that was from office works that was well worth the extra money. Even the little rubbery bits on the bottom aren't placed correctly.,NEGATIVE
"Packs small and made of high quality materials. Elevates laptop from desk.  Problem- the locking at the angle isn't very secure so removing your laptop can cause it to collapse but if you don't plan on moving your laptop a lot, you should be good.",POSITIVE
This is an absolute laptop for office use. With the help of 13th gen processor speed is excellent. Metal body gives sleek finish and sturdiness. Loved it. Just go for it.,POSITIVE
"Great product with lot of useful applications and features for every day usage. Light weight and easy to carry, with latest processor giving good performance.",POSITIVE
"Reviewing after 1 month of usages!! First I'm confused about this laptop because of the negative review ,it's a great laptop for basic use & for professionals. Pros- -The build quality is good 👍🏻, - the design is very sleek smooth - keyboard quality and keys are good, ☺️ -Processor is beast very much satisfied , -Battery life is also average max 4 hr to 5 hr depends on usages , - lenovo service is so good I can say cause I noticed that my touchpad is sometimes lagging(coz of BIOS not uptodate) so I connect with the support team in lenovo offical website , he fixed it in just 10 mins! ☺️  CONS - Brightness is bit low have to set in 80 to100 range - speaker sound is average! - while charging the heating issue felt but not very much - only 60hrz refresh rate not satisfied - sometimes display wombling not much but little - backlit light is dim. Overall it'a good laptop ♥️ 4.5/5 If your priority is not gaming or editing then you can go for it! 👍🏻",POSITIVE
Almost using it for 5 days :-  Pros :- 👍👍 .) Build quality💥 .) Display worth the money .) Battery life - I got 7.5 hrs with normal usage ( offline movies + YouTube + Browsing + Pdf reading) with Wifi and Bluetooth turned on all the time...I kept brightness at 30% ( since It is sufficient for me in indoors ) and in dark mode... Another time I got only 5.5 hrs of battery life...so not sure of the exact battery span. .) Flip to start is very useful .) Booting time is only 10-15 secs max .) Performance is good for this budget .) Light weight and very convenient to use especially for studying  Cons :- 👎👎 .) Heating issue while charging😮‍💨 .) Sometimes it heats up even with normal usage .) Speaker is good but sound is low .) Missing fingerprint sensor/Facial recognition in this range  Tips :- .) Don't charge immediately after using for more hours...let the heat to cool down and then charge .) After charging let the heat to cool down..then start to use ( will Increase battery span )  Product got delivered b4 the due date...and packaging was good 👍  Conclusion : Simply go for it if you are a student and doesn't play that much of games💥,NEGATIVE
"Very good Investment. Battery, Performance, Display, Speaker excellent.",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop few days back. There was an issue with the screen so I had to return/replace it. The amazon guys has been lying from start. They said they were going to initiate a lenovo technician visit. I waited for 2 days, no one came so I called lenovo directly. They said they had no notification regarding any booking of technician visit.  Once I booked the technician visit in lenovo's side a visit was arranged. In the meantime amazon kept telling me that their hands are tied as long as the product is not sealed by lenovo. Once lenoco technician checks the project and gives no objection for return we will return/replace it immediately. Now it has been almost 2 weeks, everyday a return is created and gets cancelled saying the product was not ready when actually no one visited.  My biggest mistake was to buy it from amazon. The laptop is actually good. But directly from lenovo or may ve croma.",NEGATIVE
"It's very slim , The build is plastic but it's very tough , the display is FHD and it's a good display, The processer is actually a beast but you need to use it on charging to utilise it's full capacity , battery backup despite of having a H series processor and 48W Battery it performs very well and give you a 5hr screen on time the sound isn't too loud but if you keep it on your lap or so then you won't face any issue , And the main keypoint of this laptop is it's i7 13gen processor which is very very powerful but remember it has a intel UHD graphics so you are not going to play any graphics involving games it won't be a smooth experience overall a good product for real",NEGATIVE
"First of all thanks to Amazon for the fastest deliveries less than 24 hours with good shape. Now on the laptop front superb finish love at first sight, it is a clean laptop with all the essential features. Top lid is of metal a premium quality laptop with precise cut at each and every corner. It is a 12th Generation i5 - 12450H processor laptop due to which no issues at the processing of task no matter what you give, it run as a breeze, no fingerprint sensor, no graphics card it had a internal graphics card which is terrible if you want this laptop for gaming purpose then do not purchase this. I have purchased this as i have no use of graphics card.  Pros:  ASPECT RATIO: 16:10 ( Major highlight which is helpful in Coding ) SCREEN : IPS Panel with 60Hz resolution with good viewing angle. CHARGER: 65 Watt Charger with USB type C FRONT CAM: 720p with privacy shutter. SSD: 500 GB (with upgradable option) TRACK PAD : Very nice wide and smooth scroll with good tactile feedback. BACKLITE KEYBOARD : YES  Cons:  RAM: 16 GB ( not upgradable this is a major downside of this laptop which is so expensive) HDD: ( no slot for HDD ) FINGERPRINT : NO GRAPHICS CARD: Inbuilt  HEATING ISSUE:  Most important due to which I gave it a less rating since Lenovo knows it is a H series processor therefore vents should be cut out at the side end of the laptop but at present the vent is at the screen & bottom end due to which when performing high priority tasks it becomes hot as it is clocked at base 2.0 Ghz the keyboard area becomes hot and due to vents placed at screen side screen & metal lid becomes hot not that much hot but still a premium laptop Ideapad 5 series should not have this kind of issues. During benchmark test the keyboard area becomes serious hot and the screen area the right bottom area becomes hot due to vent throwing air at the screen.",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6"" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.  What stands out for me is how lightweight it is—just 1.66kg—making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.  Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.  If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.  Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!",POSITIVE
"Kindly note that this is not a physical damage from our side. Build Quality is very poor. The service center itself agrees that this specific model has issues with its hinges. Initially they agreed to replace the same on free of cost. Then they informed us that this specific model/complaint is not covered under warranty. We agreed to repair it on our cost as the laptop was very urgent for us. The Dell Authorized Service Center at Palarivattom, Kochi informed us that they require 4-6 working days to ""submit the quote"" for the replacement part. After our confirmation, they'll order the replacement part and again we need to wait for another 7-10 Working days for the parts to come and get it repaired. We have never came across such a HOPELESS Service & Service Center.",NEGATIVE

"I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings. I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called ""support"" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn’t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product? I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I’ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I’m stuck with a defective laptop. This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don’t make the same mistake I did.",NEGATIVE
"Light weight, thin & smooth to use",POSITIVE
"As it's a dell make nothing to explain about. How good the product is. Value for money, Good Battery Life, Looks and size is also good.",POSITIVE

Thanks to amazon for giving massive discount on my sbi card during republic day sale which made it possible for me to get this beast. It performs as you think it would. Everything runs buttery smooth but there is battery drop issue i think 230w adapter will fix that aside from that there is not problem and rgb backlight keyboard would have been cool.,NEGATIVE
So the best thing about this laptop is that the build quality is sturdy. Do note that this processor has no iGPU so your battery life is limited to 4 hours and does not go higher than that when not plugged in. That being said a friend of mine got the G14 zyphrus and we were gaming at max settings and this laptop did not hit 60 degrees whereas the G14 was touching 85 degrees hence the cooling system is amazing. Another thing I have realised is that I don’t use the laptop when it isn’t plugged in and I do not require 15 -20 hrs of battery life. Also all tasks and jobs run very smoothly on this and I feel its worth the trade off for price and hardware,POSITIVE
"Got it at 71k, faced a screen flickering issue after 2 days but other than that it worths every single penny in terms of display and gaming. It has better display and gaming performance then nitro and victus.",NEGATIVE
"As people have mentioned previously, the main issue is due to unavailablity of iGPU which spoils the battery life. Overall a decent laptop and worth the price.  I’ll edit my comms after using it for a couple of months",NEGATIVE
So far i am really satisfied with my Laptop. Yes there are some things that could have been better. Like the brightness could have been better. But the colour accuracy and all is good. The build is noce. Speaker quality is good not so bad but could have been better. It is on a heavier side but you know it is a gaming laptop. Many people complaint about the fan noise but i think most of the gaming laptops have this thing. It is just to keep your machine cool you can ignore that. The fan speed can be kept in quiet mode in normal usage. Battery life if you ask me lasted for 2.5-3hrs but i saw a minor charge drop while i was using heavily. 170w charger is not enough. J suggest you contact the customer care and get a 230w one. I bought it for ₹69k during republic day sale. I think its worth every penny.,NEGATIVE
A fully charged laptop dies in just one hour of Bubble game. I bought a gaming laptop for it's efficiency. But never expected such a low quality battery in such a new age laptop. How will I travel with this kinda of a laptop. How will I do anything at all if the battery does not last even an hour. Am I expected to stay plugged in all the time ?? I am disappointed. Why are they selling such low quality laptops or even making them for that matter. Useless.,NEGATIVE
Everything is very good but battery is equally bad,NEGATIVE
I would suggest to wait for some sale and go for 4060 with 7-8k more else you might regret when games like GTA 6 drops! Click on my profile to see gaming laptop idealist for more choices.,NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased this laptop for my sister as she started her college journey, and it has proven to be a great choice!  For its price, this laptop delivers solid performance. It handles everyday tasks like note-taking, browsing, and streaming lectures smoothly. While it may not be a powerhouse for heavy gaming or complex design software, it’s more than sufficient for a typical college student’s needs.  The laptop is lightweight and easy to carry, which is a big plus for a student constantly on the move between classes. The sleek design adds a professional touch, and it looks more expensive than it actually is.  The battery life is commendable—lasting long enough to get through a full day of classes without needing a charge, depending on usage.  Overall, this laptop is a fantastic student-friendly option that balances performance and affordability. If you're looking for a dependable device for college, this is a great pick!",POSITIVE
Works as advertised! The included MS office was the clincher. Using for two weeks now! Cannot complain!,POSITIVE
"The product is running like as a refurbished is sent. The return is an harrowing experience, amazon making promises everyday but not taking back. Even the physical inspection was marked as done without anyone visiting to check and return.",NEGATIVE
Very good and easily uses product nice👍,POSITIVE
"1: Design is good. I bought the one with 14 Inch and it was damn beautiful.  2: Keyboard has backlit.  3: Processor, configuration is very nice - i3 core 12th gen, 8GB RAM, 512 GB SSD  4: Sound is nice  5: Screen can be improved. The colors are little distracted and too whitish. The screen panel could have been better. However, considering the price I will say it works.  6: It has Microsoft Office 21  7: Setting up is easy (ensure a good internet connection)  8: Price - I got it at INR 32190.  9: No fingerprint sensor  10: weight is decent, not too heavy considering you choose 14 Inch version.",POSITIVE

"This Lanovo laptop looks fine. But i have a major concern that I purchased this in last week of December 2024 and so my warranty of one year should be valid till December 2025, but it is showing that warranty started in July 2024. I need help and support on this issue.",NEGATIVE
"Even though the Microsoft Office package was supposed to be included with the laptop, as informed at the time of purchase, it was not included. This is very disappointing.",NEGATIVE
It works awesome design is very sleek coming to battery 🔋 I have to charge it 5 to 6 times in a day so battery doesn't lasts for long hours but it depends on invidiual use processing speed is good heat level so it doesn't not heat on multiple charge display quality is very good,POSITIVE

"Okay review after 3 months ? 2 months ? Idk I forgot anyways, the laptop is bigger than you'd expect, slim, light, above average performance! Pros : Back-lit keyboard Accessibility is numerous, Ryzen Processor > Intel Display : Large Colour contrast : Vibrant Colour, FHD Charging takes less time ! Value for money ? Big yes ! (Better than Ausus, HP, sorry not sorry but all my families use different laptop that's much pricier than this laptop but it outperforms ausus vivobook, hp)  Cons : • Not for heavy gaming as it drains quiet fast when you play games on it ( on 100% it drained quiet fast when I played DOTA) • Bluetooth tend to stop working when you're using a wireless mouse/keyboard and Bluetooth earbuds both connected to the laptop (you have to disconnect either the ear buds or the mouse) Camera : TRASH (Sorry not sorry)  Conclusion: Dont play heavy games, good for academic works ( if you're not a developer don't stress on it but learn python at the least lol )  Should you buy it ? Yes, if it's well within your budget (It's better than vivobook :D)",NEGATIVE
"I bought this Lenovo Ideapad laptop 3 months ago and after use of less than 2 months battery is not taking charge. I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products. At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.",NEGATIVE
"The laptop is best in category for the 16 GB RAM and 512 SSD for this price. The AMD Ryzen processor is strong enough for regular use at home.  As opposed to what many mention, the laptop does come with a backlit keyboard.  There is a pre-installed Microsoft Office also ready to use. Just have to create an account if you don't have one and login.",POSITIVE
I have ordered the backlit keyboard laptop but it does not have any backlit keyboard plz check whenever you are buying this product,NEGATIVE
Really good product from Lenovo. Awesome backlit. Very good display.,POSITIVE
"I got it at 44k & I was happy with it's performance for first 15 days. But then I went for Diwali vacation & on return after 2 weeks when I opened it, it was not starting. It's motherboard was dead. I went to their service centre & they resolved the issue free of cost. But this should not have happened this soon.  Anyways it's working fine now & after 6 months of use I am writing this review. Great & fast service from Lenovo. Thanks!!",NEGATIVE
"This laptop shouldn't be listed on Amazon. Just after one month from purchase, my laptop stopped working suddenly. I checked with Lenovo's technical support team. After checking it virtually, they said it's motherboard failure. The system's performance is also not up to mark. It hangs when you perform basic tasks with multiple tabs on Chrome. If someone reads this review from India (Tamilnadu), I would say the Government provided laptop (Amma, Kalaignar) laptops are far better compared to this useless laptop. Never buy it. Amazon please re-view my issue and unlist this system. Atleast someone will not fall on this trap",NEGATIVE

"The HP Laptop 15s with AMD Ryzen 3 5300U is perfect for daily tasks. The 15.6-inch FHD display is clear and vibrant, great for work and entertainment. It’s lightweight (1.69 kg) and easy to carry around, making it ideal for students and professionals.  Performance is smooth with 8GB RAM and a 512GB SSD, ensuring fast boot times and multitasking. The dual speakers provide clear audio, and the preloaded Windows 11 and MS Office 2019 are a huge plus.  Overall, it’s a stylish, reliable laptop at a great price. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"I am overall very satisfied with the HP Laptop 💻. It works smoothly, the performance is excellent ⚡, and the battery life is great 🔋. The keyboard is comfortable to use ⌨️, and the design is sleek and modern ✨. However, the only issue I have is with the display. The screen is not very clear when viewed from different angles 👀; it’s only sharp and visible when looking straight from the front 👈. If the display had better viewing angles, it would be a perfect laptop.",POSITIVE
Good,POSITIVE
"After couple of months of usage, its keypad stopped working completely. Taken to HP service centre and they took some time to identify the fault as due to keyboard IC fault. It had to be replaced was their suggestion. But since it went bad exactly after the warranty period was over, the charge for repair was too high just for keypad IC change. They were asking close to 1/4 th of the laptop cost. I abandoned that idea and started using with external Keyboard connected to USB. Not happy with this product.",NEGATIVE
Nice product for daily life office use. Great battery backup. Smooth file transfers. Best laptop in its segment. HP always delivers best.,POSITIVE
"15s-eq2143au laptop model Performance wise is good. Pros: Bootup time is 13 sec. All the application works like charms. Build quality is acceptable from the price point of view. Cons: Unable to add HDD to this model. I visited hp service centre and told that this model doesn't support addition of hdd, which I felt major drawback of this model. Power button is not up to the quality, it will not sustain for long time. Overall good model from hp but with some storage limitation. I purchased during summer sale for 40k. And waiting for return to go with some other model. In q&a section some comments have mentioned that it is possible to add HDD. But they have mentioned wrongly.",NEGATIVE

"I've got the ryzen 3 5000 series 8gb variant in july 2024  It has been 2 days of using it The built quality of my unit is intact,no damage or scratches so far since delivery  Coming from using IPS display in desktop and amoled in cellphone the screen quality of the laptop feels dull but knowing what i paid for and got,I'm ok with it. if anyone is planning to get this product they will get used to the display quality eventually  I haven't installed anything yet and feel it's bit laggy but I'm ok with it,as I don't play games and will use it for online work and other productive work which don't require that much memory(although RAM can be extended in this model), people should go for the 16gb ram varient if availability of ryzen 3 5000 is there,under 31k or less  Battery backup is about 3/4 hours of average usage, but more backup can be achieved according to usage patterns, adjusting screen brightness in a new unit as it gets older battery degradation will happen eventually as backup of the laptop  WiFi is working fine so far, haven't tried bluetooth function yet  Speaker is of average quality but on softer side,what i felt could have been a little louder  Keyboard is without backlit and responsive, if you have big hands and fingers then it might be an issue(buy an external keyboard and mouse)like me and this will solve the inconvenience and longevity of keyboard and trackpad of laptop  All the ports and jack are working fine  What i had seen in videos and reviews, i thought they will provide a 45watt charger but they have provided with 65 watt charger which charges quite fast, which is a plus point but still it takes about 2 hrs 10 min to fully charged from 7% to 100% in my case(with wifi/ bluetooth off and no apps running in background with 25 to 30% screen brightness)  It doesn't come with lifetime validity of MS office you have to buy after free trail period or find a cracked one from local computer stores  Overall you can buy the laptop if you are in a budget with decent built,fast charging,full HD screen and average performance under 27000 then go for it,you can also get it under 25000 during sale seasons using bank cards and exchange offers  In future I will update my review or post a comment if something unusual things come by with the laptop",NEGATIVE
"I received my Acer Aspire laptop yesterday, and I'm thrilled with its performance so far! With 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, this laptop is a beast. The AMD Ryzen 5-5625U processor handles multitasking with ease.  The laptop's build quality is solid, and it looks sleek. I've been using it for general productivity, browsing, and it's handled everything seamlessly.  Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. The Acer Aspire offers incredible value for its price. If you're in the market for a reliable and powerful laptop, I highly recommend considering this one!  Pros:  - Excellent performance - Ample storage and RAM - Sleek design - Great value for the price  Cons: None so far!",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop 6 months ago, and it stopped working. First, the screen failed, and later, the motherboard was found faulty. I raised a complaint on 15th January, but even after 15 days, the issue is unresolved. Delays in ordering parts and no updates from the service center make this experience even worse.  Terrible product and service. Highly disappointed!  Rating: 1/5",NEGATIVE
Best in budget Best in performance Best in quality Display is good,POSITIVE
"With this laptop, what you see is what you get. Nothing exceptional but still very solid. Decent build with a sturdy enough body, the screen hinge is a bit on the loose side so it does wobble a bit while moving it. In terms of performance the Ryzen 5 5625U is perhaps the best in the price range. You also get 16 gigs of ram as opposed to 8 gigs on most competitors. The fans are quite loud so if you're someone who wants a quiet, low profile laptop then be warned. Overall, very good value for price.",POSITIVE
"I received this laptop with open( teared amazon box) but since laptop was untampered I let it go. Firstly, this is my first laptop so I'll just type in my experience.  It is lagging even to run prince of Persia ( which is a small game,) ..  Also there are constant lags even which doing simple stuff on this laptop.  There seems to a problem, it takes a minute to wake up from sleep mode and power button keeps blinking....I think it's an issue  The VRAM is 512 MB .... Please take my advice and don't buy this  Battery doesn't last well...it comes to 30% with only 3 hours of usage, but since it has a fast charger it gets charged quickly.  There is no backlit keyboard, and screen is worse... it'll have to be at a certain angle to view things clearly.  performance is good ( as I only used ms edge so far, yet I experienced lags while closing and adding new Tabs. I'll update more with time.  I",NEGATIVE

It is not good product. It is fully waste. Amazon was a fraud seller. With in 1 month we got a straight line on the display so the display got damage it can cost more than 2000 or 3000 for fixing the laptop display so don't buy this.

"I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:  Pros:  - Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences. - Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay. - Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips. - Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use. - Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.  Cons:  - Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check. - Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.  Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.  Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.  Rating Breakdown:  - Performance: 5/5 - Display: 5/5 - Battery Life: 4.5/5 - Design: 4.5/5 - Value: 5/5  Would I recommend it? Absolutely!",POSITIVE
"I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition. Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.  Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)  The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.  The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.  Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.",NEGATIVE
"Hi guys, Here is my review after using this laptop.  Laptop pro's - Design, price and performance.  Laptop design - This laptop's design feels premium and nice.  Laptop performance - It can handle GTA 5 smoothly. Also can record gameplay.  Laptop thermals - Laptop gets hot only during gaming. But it doesn't over heat as far as I used.  Laptop con's - I noticed some bugs/glitches like cursor while using in typing area or text box it gets white or kinda invisible I feel this maybe a bug.  -Screen goes off for a second sometimes while playing videos or browsing especially in battery power.  -Blue screen error: I have faced blue screen error two times till now while switching from power mode to battery mode(plugging out adapter).",NEGATIVE
"I bought an Asus TUF GAMING 15 from amazon on 16/10/2024.

"This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc... Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful. Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card. Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a ""battery care mode"" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!! This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!! Top notch 5/5 stars!!!",POSITIVE

"I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpad",POSITIVE
"As a first-time laptop user, the Dell 15 has exceeded my expectations with its excellent performance and versatile features. I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.  **Performance and Display:** Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.  **Portability and Build Quality:** Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.  **Value for Money:** At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.  **Future Updates:** I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time.

"I recently purchased a Dell laptop from Amazon, expecting a hassle-free experience. Unfortunately, the laptop had significant issues with sound and audio quality. Upon reaching out to Amazon customer support, a technician troubleshot the issue and confirmed it was a defective product. The technician assured me that the laptop would be returned the next day.  However, I was unable to track the return process. When I followed up with customer support, I was told that I needed to visit a Dell service center to obtain a ""declined support letter"" from Dell, which confirms that Dell would not service the defective product.  This entire process is both frustrating and illogical. My purchase was from Amazon, and I bought a brand-new product. Why should I be responsible for visiting a Dell service center? If I wanted to rely on in-person service, I would have purchased the laptop from a physical outlet instead of Amazon.  This experience has been incredibly disappointing. I highly recommend against purchasing electronic items from Amazon. Their service has significantly declined, making it a frustrating experience for customers when dealing with defective products.",NEGATIVE

I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..",POSITIVE

"I recently purchased a Dell laptop from Amazon, expecting a hassle-free experience. Unfortunately, the laptop had significant issues with sound and audio quality. Upon reaching out to Amazon customer support, a technician troubleshot the issue and confirmed it was a defective product. The technician assured me that the laptop would be returned the next day.  However, I was unable to track the return process. When I followed up with customer support, I was told that I needed to visit a Dell service center to obtain a ""declined support letter"" from Dell, which confirms that Dell would not service the defective product.  This entire process is both frustrating and illogical. My purchase was from Amazon, and I bought a brand-new product. Why should I be responsible for visiting a Dell service center? If I wanted to rely on in-person service, I would have purchased the laptop from a physical outlet instead of Amazon.  This experience has been incredibly disappointing. I highly recommend against purchasing electronic items from Amazon. Their service has significantly declined, making it a frustrating experience for customers when dealing with defective products.",NEGATIVE
"I’m really happy with the laptop I bought on Amazon – it’s fast, efficient, and great for everyday use. The quality exceeded my expectations for the price!",POSITIVE
"Nice compact laptop. Decent built quality. Perfect for students, office use . MS Office home edition avaliable. Overall decent product in this category.",POSITIVE
This is hands down the most well configured laptop in this price range. The best thing is that this laptop has DDR5 RAM and the latest generation of AMD 7000 series processor. However would have preferred support for Gen 2 USB Type C for faster and more convenient charging options. The installed m.2 ssd is slower than some of the options available in this price range. Light gaming is very much possible with tweaking the system but it's not recommended as this laptop wasn't built with such scenarios in mind. Overall a very good option for a work and light entertainment oriented laptop in a tight budget.,POSITIVE
"The orders was delivered on the same delevery day and best for normal, and for lower rendering games. Overall best for business and home purpose.",NEGATIVE
Volume of speakers are very low and rest all is ok as on this price.,POSITIVE

"1. Perfect size, calculator touchpad is superb, comes with office home edition, perfect for school students. 2. MIL 810 rating is given, but feels flimsy due to plastic body construction. Gimmick. 3. No lighted keypad. Big let down. 4. HD screen feels a let down.. Color saturation is not great.. Looks more whiter. 5. Great pricing... 30k 6. Super packing with laptop bottom stand using cardboard.. Nice idea. 7. Small charge adaptor saves lot of space. 8. No intel mental inside, it's AMD...  Overall perfect buy for school and college students at 30k.",NEGATIVE
As using Laptop for 3 hrs. it heats more,NEGATIVE
Iam not able toto on backlit in the keyboard please advise,NEGATIVE
"The laptop I received is with all same functions as mentioned except one which was one of highlight for me and it’s “backlit keyboard”. The whole function is missing with absence of backlit on F7.

Worse product I have ever seen 1)it is not powering on for 20 minutes after get on it is getting stuck and buffering only for 10 to 15 min 2) mouse pad is not working 3) build quality is very poor 4) after I am complaining about it they only tell me that 'Sorry sir we can't refund you' NOTE: THINK 100 TIMES BEFORE YOU BUY THIS LAPTOP,NEGATIVE
"For the price, the build quality is decent. Performance of the Ryzen5 processor is decent, definitely not at the level of the i5's. The screen quality is the weakest link here, too much screen whitewash, not able to get the color calibration right. My 2018 Asus laptop has better screen quality. Overall it is a decent buy for regular office use.",POSITIVE
"Good specifications, lots of RAM and storage for the price. Its good for basic everyday usage and has a decent display.",POSITIVE
"It is an amazing laptop for this price range it offers a great performance, does miss the backlit keyboard also there is some cost cutting for the screen colour combination for the lower variants. But the quality it gives is just premium it's a great laptop for college going students/ for programming.",POSITIVE
Who can imagine a 57k laptop without backlit keyboard in 2023? Not expected from ASUS atleast. It has reduced the saleability of an otherwise brilliant laptop.,NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased this laptop for my sister as she started her college journey, and it has proven to be a great choice!  For its price, this laptop delivers solid performance. It handles everyday tasks like note-taking, browsing, and streaming lectures smoothly. While it may not be a powerhouse for heavy gaming or complex design software, it’s more than sufficient for a typical college student’s needs.  The laptop is lightweight and easy to carry, which is a big plus for a student constantly on the move between classes. The sleek design adds a professional touch, and it looks more expensive than it actually is.  The battery life is commendable—lasting long enough to get through a full day of classes without needing a charge, depending on usage.  Overall, this laptop is a fantastic student-friendly option that balances performance and affordability. If you're looking for a dependable device for college, this is a great pick!",POSITIVE
Works as advertised! The included MS office was the clincher. Using for two weeks now! Cannot complain!,POSITIVE

Very good and easily uses product nice👍,POSITIVE
"1: Design is good. I bought the one with 14 Inch and it was damn beautiful.  2: Keyboard has backlit.  3: Processor, configuration is very nice - i3 core 12th gen, 8GB RAM, 512 GB SSD  4: Sound is nice  5: Screen can be improved. The colors are little distracted and too whitish. The screen panel could have been better. However, considering the price I will say it works.  6: It has Microsoft Office 21  7: Setting up is easy (ensure a good internet connection)  8: Price - I got it at INR 32190.  9: No fingerprint sensor  10: weight is decent, not too heavy considering you choose 14 Inch version.",POSITIVE

The stand is lightweight but feels sturdy, made from high-quality aluminum that provides a premium feel without being too heavy.  One of the standout features is the adjustable height and angle settings, which allow for a customizable viewing experience.

Setup was incredibly easy, and it’s portable enough to throw in my bag when I need to take it on the go. It also doesn’t take up too much desk space, which is an added bonus for those of us with smaller work areas.

Other than that, this stand is definitely a great addition to my desk, improving both comfort and productivity.  **Pros:** - Adjustable height and angle - Lightweight and portable - Great build quality - Keeps laptop cool - Easy to set up  **Cons:** - Not ideal for larger laptops  Overall, I highly recommend this stand for anyone looking to improve their ergonomic setup and comfort while working on their laptop!",POSITIVE

Very useful. + MS Office is preinstalled. + Nice color rendering by screen. + Battery backup is decent. + Good sound.  - Sound could be little louder.,POSITIVE

"I had the opportunity to use the HP 15s 11th Generation Intel i3 laptop for a while, and I must say that it is a pretty decent machine. While it may not be the most powerful laptop out there, it is certainly a good choice for everyday use.  The laptop is equipped with an 11th Generation Intel i3 processor, which is fast enough for most tasks such as web browsing, word processing, and watching videos. The 15.6-inch Full HD display is bright and clear, and the colors are vibrant. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the touchpad is responsive and accurate.  One thing I really appreciate about this laptop is its design. It has a sleek and modern look with a slim profile, making it easy to carry around. The build quality is solid, and it feels sturdy in your hand. The laptop also has a good selection of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and a headphone jack, which makes it easy to connect to external devices.  Another aspect of this laptop that I like is its battery life. The laptop has a decent battery life, lasting around 7-8 hours on a single charge. This is good enough for a full day's work or study without having to worry about finding a power outlet.  However, there are a few downsides to this.  the laptop's performance may be lacking if you plan to use it for more demanding tasks such as gaming or video editing.  Overall, I would give the HP 15s 11th Generation Intel i3 laptop a four-star rating. It is a good laptop for everyday use, with a sleek design, solid build quality, decent performance, and good battery life. However, it may not be the best choice for users who need more storage or require high-performance computing.",POSITIVE

"Laptop looks stylish and looks premium however only time will tell how the built quality is. Serves my work related purpose. Performace is good as the clock speed of processor is 3 Ghz (not 4.1 which is maximum extent of clocking purformance of the processor. Pro:- 1. Looks premium ( hp logo is cheery on top) 2. Keyboard quality is good and all necessary keys are present on keyboard (no need of pressing fn for some important keys like home, pageup and page down etc. 3. Speaker quality is very good compared to lenovo, asus or dell in this price range. Loud and clear. 4. Two usb type A 3.0 and one usb type C 3.0 (might be 3.2 I am not sure) 5. Pre-installed OS and office with lifetime validity 6. Browsing speed is also very good  Con:- 1. Visibility of alphabets and numbers becomes very bad in low light condition (might not be a con for experienced typist). Keys are not even like somwhere its ok and somwhere its bumpy or not aligned properly. But typing will not get affected. 2. Screen quality is very down grade. Other laptops like Asus are providing Oled display in this price range. Brightness is very low. My old lenovo Ideapad has better brightness and clearity of screen than this laptop (which I bought for Rs. 25K before 5 years) 3. For those who wants to extend the screen for uptop 2 monitors, the given USB C port doesnt support video output so you can only connect one monitor at a time. 4. No option to expand SSD storage as it only supports 512 Gb (which is already included) and no extra SSD slot or even HDD slot.  Can't say: 1. Performace will get tested after heavy usage so will update later 2. Not faced heating issue which will only get tested after heavy usage  Edit: 1) Battery last for 6 to 7 hours while using only excel or any other basic work 2) Good news for GTA 5 lovers as it can run but on low settings. You won't get graphics but game runs smoothly. 3) Has heating issues even after running excel and tally prime",NEGATIVE

Excellent laptop,POSITIVE
Great laptop. Trust worthy Seller.,POSITIVE
"If it works, it's a great laptop. While it was working it was able to play aaa games in high res, supports 2k external monitor, gave 6.5-7 hours of battery on development activities, screen is good and crystal clear. Speakers are a pure letdown.  But Asus has become house for unreliable laptops. It's not even a month since I recived the new laptop, mine stuck at boot screen asus logo, service centre technicians declared it a motherboard issue, it's been with them since a week waiting on parts.  I had 2022 g15, it also had screen issues which got replaced under warranty but then webcam stopped and after getting a new webcam machine started getting shutdown 10 min into battery. The service centres are authorised partners of asus and fully incapable of fixing issues reliably.  Despite problems with old laptop I went with another of Asus's premium laptop thinking they might have improved. But na, the same old issues due to cheapAss quality checks at asus and their unreliable incapable service partners.",POSITIVE
"The laptop is metal yet lightweight and sturdy, while packing a punch, The Battery is decent lasted me about 6 hours+ with lightweight browsing and with integrated Graphics. The Ryzen 9 AI HX370 processor has NPU which allows to run AI models locally.  Running on RTX4060 with high refresh rates and on high-power mode shortens the battery ( suggesting running it plugged in to save the battery ) the keyboard has only one color ( not a big deal for me ). The biggest drawback is the speaker volume which is very low.  Extended warranty is on offer right now at asuspromo website ( document yet for review ) which saves me a good 10K on warranty extension ( highly recommended ). Overall a decent laptop so far, Not sure if i can really save on the extended warranty * yet to see..",NEGATIVE
Value for money. Speed is Ok. Battery backup at this budget is also ok. Build quality Ok. The only issue is that if you live in cold places like really cold where it can get upto 5 to 2 degrees without any heater or warm room the laptop 💻 gets crazy slow.,NEGATIVE

No heating issue, weight is moderate, good to handle, processor performance is not sooo high but better than rizen3 5 th Gen and intell i3 1215  Cons - this laptop normal price could have been lower than 39K which is a usual price, also this brand service center is not well governed by the company. Could be better in all means.  Overall a good product if below 35K. Value for money, best suited for student not having heavy coding stuff to do or gaming aspiration.",POSITIVE

I wanted to place a webcam protector/ slider cover, but so far, I'm unable to find any which fits due to the narrow borders.",NEGATIVE
Vey good laptop with high refresh rate and with a good user interface experience. If you are a student and a programmer i definitely would recommend this. If you are an editor you can have a look on this. Coming back to batter it last up to 3-4 hours which is okayish. Over all i would give 4.9/5 . #bestfromdell #amazingfromdell #dell,POSITIVE
"Writing review for Amazon service.  Amazon has recently changed their policy with laptops, they don't allow you to return the product anymore. I had a really really bad experience with their service and even being a prime member didn't make any difference.  so firstly the packaging was open, then laptop started behaving weirdly, I was seeing black screen at random while working on the laptop. Thirdly when I ran benchmark test software on the laptop I received it performed very poorly (24th percentile) when compared with same laptops around the globe (I suspected this when I observed that the laptop was performing slow & laggy)  I first talked to DELL service centre, the told me that they don't replace laptops, thereafter, the amazon representative requested for a technician for me. First technician marked that the issue was resolved but actually it wasn't. So I had to request for an another technician. Second technician arrived and told me that he has reported the issue with the laptop and filed for a return from his side, but he actually marked the issue as resolved without filling any return. After that I waited for whole day waiting for Amazon representative but he didn't call even after assuring me that he takes full responsibility of my issue.  So I had to call Amazon again, had to explain the whole thing again to 3 different Amazon representative. Again I got promised by an Amazon Representative that they will help me resolve the issue and call me back but NO ONE called.  So I had to again call Amazon once again, had to explain the same thing again and now I am stuck because they don't send technician the third time and since both technicians have marked the issue as resolved Amazon has denied to help. So I am basically stuck with this laptop and have lost 65K just like that and laptop is of no use to me.  I have ordered many times from Amazon but never have I expected that a brand which portrays itself to be consumer focused would do to someone who has been their user from a long time.",NEGATIVE
Worth purchase,POSITIVE
"Laptop recd before the committed time. As it is a new product, comenting on battery life is too early. Working on tally software is a tedious job as kayboard backlight is not working while working on tally and some other softwares. Touchpad is very sensetive and unnecessary opens other dialog boxes. Display screen goes beyond the laptop surface edges when open and every time there is a risk of damages of display's hinges.",NEGATIVE

"I recently purchased the HP Pavilion 15 (model eg3036) with an Intel i7 13th generation 1360P processor and a 1TB SSD for ₹77,000. After using it for two weeks, I'm sharing my initial impressions.  Build quality: The build quality is excellent compared to its peers. Previously, I ordered the Asus Vivobook 15X, which, despite meeting the MIL-STD-810G standard, didn't feel as sturdy.  Audio and speakers: The audio quality of the HP Pavilion is also impressive, with loud and clear speakers that outperform those of the Asus.  Display: The laptop features an IPS LCD FHD display that supports HDR video. It's bright enough for use in sunlight, and the anti-glare coating is useful for day-to-day tasks.  Battery 🔋: With heavy or moderate usage, I'm getting about 4 hours of screen-on time, which is decent considering its 42Wh battery. It also supports fast charging, reaching 50 to 60% in just 40 minutes. Charging adopter heating while charging but laptop is not heating while doing tasks.  That's all for now. I'll provide a full review of the product after a month of use.  Note: When purchasing laptops during sales, don't just go for the lowest prices or best offers; make sure to check the seller's rating. I learned this the hard way when I initially bought an Asus Vivobook 15X OLED. After just an hour of use, it showed a blue screen error and wouldn't turn on. I had to go through some hassle to return it and get a refund before finally purchasing an HP laptop. So, please be careful and pay attention to seller feedback and ratings instead of just focusing on lower prices 💰. Happy shopping 🛍️!",POSITIVE
"Pretty disappointed overall, had a motherboard crash within 5 months and the Bluetooth is pathetic, had lot of lag and noise problems, I have to use wired headphones everytime. Also surprised to see no ethernet port which is surprising. Laptop for that price needs to be better.",NEGATIVE
Good lap,POSITIVE
A good laptop overall.,POSITIVE
You can get discount outside from stores. Configuration is very good. Go for it. HP is a reliable brand. 🫵,POSITIVE
I received a defectproduct from amazon.... Brought HP pavilion notebook... The product that I received having display problem.. HP service engineer inspected and given certificate of DOA(DEAD ON AREIVAL)... But still amazon or HP not given proper response for replacement or refund... Still 10 days passed,NEGATIVE
"I got it in below 60 k and it is one of the best laptop in this price range in terms of price , looks , build quality, portability",POSITIVE
This is very good laptop. People with habit of using large screen may not like it but other than that it's great. One person has written in review that 8000 series is old processor. That person is confused between AMD and Intel. AMD's 8000 series is zen4 generation and is latest processor in India. Intel's 8000 series is old and its latest processor is 14000 series. A single online search will reveal it.,NEGATIVE
"PROS: Looks: Premium in looks. Size: 13.3inch IPS Panel (I am always fond of) and very Lite in weight. Easy to carry if u r a frequent traveler. Build quality: Seems good to me but doesn't feel sturdy. Screen: at 400 nits it's very nice to work on, browse websites and watch movies etc. Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 8640 with Radeon 760M graphics is very fast to my requirements. Battery Backup: Last much longer in comparison to my Lenovo ThinkPad same size with Intel i5 Vpro processor. Sound: Sound quality is quite good. CONS: Build quality: doesn't seem great to me in comparison to my Lenovo ThinkPad corporate laptop. The hinge of the screen is little loose in comparison to my Lenovo ThinkPad. Screen: doesn't have blue ray shield. (Nowhere mentioned. So not sure about it). Key board: Back lights of the key board are very bright and comes out from the sides of the keys so are disturbing. A separate button given to lit the key board at the 5th position from the left with function keys and is very annoying to find. The Power On button is also same as the other functional keys and is at the 2nd position from the right and also difficult to locate. Speakers: Speakers are good but are downward. So lesser volume can be expected if placed on bed etc.",NEGATIVE
It is 8th generation laptop. Very slow performance. Now 13th generation available. Don't buy this.,NEGATIVE
Lightweight and bight display laptop. easy to carry in your backpack and extremely lightweight,NEGATIVE
Very good Ryzen AI laptop.,POSITIVE
"Been using the laptop for a week now. I bought it specifically for its featherweight ,DDR 5 RAM and Type - C fast charging. I travel a lot and in order to travel light I wanted a laptop with type C charging so I could carry only one (compatible charger) for phone as well as laptop. So I bought a GaN charger (costar) which supports laptop PD charging. I thought I'd be able to charge my laptop using phone charger but that is not the case since the voltage is not compatible. If you are thinking of doing the same, then a heads up that even though the voltage and power are compatible, the laptop will keep on bringing up the issue of incompatible charger. Also, if you plug in a non-HP charger while the laptop is off, it will not charge. But that issue is resolved once you turn it on while charging. Also another thing to note is that while the laptop charger is 65 watt, I saw the maximum charging power of up to 50 watts (not 65). But charging speed is decent.  Overall it was a steal at 56000 at Amazon Festival.  Go for it if you want a quality lightweight laptop with latest specs. Not for gamers. The screen might feel a little smaller especially if you are coming from a 15.6"" one.  Another suggestion is to buy expensive stuff only during festival and sales.",NEGATIVE
"It's a decent product for the price. I purchased this for 55k and it justifies the price. Yes, at MRP 85k makes no sense, have better options available for the same.  Pros:  Lightweight and Portable: It's incredibly light under 1kg and thin, making it easy to carry around for work, school, or travel. Build is decent too and a lot better than Lenovo IdeaPad slim 5 and other models in the same price range.  Strong Performance: The Ryzen 5 8640U processor offers impressive performance for everyday tasks like browsing, productivity software (Word, Excel, etc.), and even light gaming.  Decent Battery Life: I usually get 4 to 5 hours of backup while watching videos or doing light tasks. Vibrant Display: The display typically offers good color accuracy and brightness, making it enjoyable for watching videos and working on creative projects.  Quiet Operation: The fans are generally quiet, even under moderate load.  Overall:  The HP Pavilion Aero with the Ryzen 5 8640U is a strong contender in the ultraportable laptop market. It offers a great balance of performance, portability, and battery life, making it suitable for a wide range of users, from students and professionals to casual users.",POSITIVE
I got this for 83500 rs which is worth the price to notch performance they have used samsung ssd 1tb and nayara solution ram i guess which is ddr 4 16gb and the 144hz display 8bit that give awsome clarity sharpness ! Performance is awsome,POSITIVE
"laptop isn't not working , even for setup amazon related person has come , they scheduled for return and not at all coming for pickup, been more than 1 week.",NEGATIVE
"There is lacking of MS OFFICE, Some popular games and even slow response with high graphics. Leggings of websites opening and all.",NEGATIVE
"The best product for the price, I got it for 83k in sale it has top notch specs everything is running smoothly and top notch gaming experience. Go for it.",POSITIVE
"Value for money, good performance, satisfactory display quality, sound quality is also good",POSITIVE
Worst laptop don't buy it the laptop gpu is rtx 4060 but with 75 watt and dynamic boost of additional 20 watt. Build quality is soo poor.,NEGATIVE
It’s an excellent product,POSITIVE
9ms response time 😭🥲🥹........ opponent will see me before I see him. Atleast 5ms should be there for good gaming.,NEGATIVE
It is good laptop dedicated for work use. It is not for gaming. Display quality is 2k resolution. Sound is nice. It is giving enough battery backup. Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.,POSITIVE
"Using it for a month and a half Pros: 16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder. Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators), Lightweight, easy and fast. Drawbacks: audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me). definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap) no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1) the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)  Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.",NEGATIVE
It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid,POSITIVE
"I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution. When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well. This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity. Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences. I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.",NEGATIVE
Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.,POSITIVE
Speed-5 star Looks-5 star Cons- very less Usb ports and no LAN port Overall best choice.,NEGATIVE
"My personal review: 1.Performance(Ram-16gb) Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily. If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily as well) but instead want a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop. 2. Display The display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well). 3.Battery Battery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range) 4.Sound Sound quality is also good and clear . Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me. 5.Heating Personally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me. Final Review - If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.",POSITIVE
"Most irritating part of this laptop is its battery backup. Its charges pretty quickly and it also discharges pretty quickly. The battery backup is really poor compared to some of the other brands. Also, during charging the touchpad is often difficult to control.",NEGATIVE
I have received t480 which is like new laptop.no scratch or no defects found till now . Battery backup is very good . Before this I returned dell latitude 5400 which was defective. But this item satisfies in all respect. Very very goooood.thanks to amazon and seller. Cheap price great item.,POSITIVE
T480 / T590 are amazing machines but only if you buy fresh from Lenovo. This one did not have MSO. On top of that the crappy pick up by ecomm with their agent lying about missing pick up and then you find their phone off. One of the worst experiences with amazon,NEGATIVE
"The laptop arrived in excellent condition, just as they said. I was worried about getting a damaged one, but thankfully, that wasn’t the case. It has an i7-8650U (not the 8550U, which they clarified which is good),intel HD 620 graphics card,16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD. However, the display isn’t 1920×1080 FHD as claimed—it’s actually 1366×768 HD, which I expected since this model usually comes with an HD screen.  Overall, it's a great laptop with some minor flaws. The keyboard has a bit of dust inside, the battery lasts around 4–5 hours, and there’s no backlit keyboard or fingerprint sensor. If you’re okay with these, it’s definitely worth considering.",POSITIVE
"I got a ""Like New"" Laptop with brand new compatible battery and type-c adapter that is giving backup from 6 hours to 10+ hours based on various use cases. This laptop helping me in developing pin drop silence work culture. Even if the piece I got has non working LAN port, that is not a problem at all for me, still overall performance and condition is far better than I had expected. Because there is not a single scratch to this laptop. It's like a brand new laptop. Thank you amazon and the seller.",POSITIVE
"Camera lens was scratched , specification mentioned 1920x1080 screen resolutions but actually got 1366x768",NEGATIVE
Must buy. Best under this price.,NEGATIVE
Display: page says Full HD but the seller sent me HD display which has half the resolution of Full HD and 1366x768 us not a good resolution for any display,NEGATIVE

This is best laptop at this price point. With h series processor and boot up time of laptop is 6-7 sec and this processor is beast.Overall everything is good. Display is decent and u have to compromise with build quality and there is no fingerprint available. If you want best display and fingerprint then go with asus vivobook 16x .,POSITIVE

"light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works . All well except one issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",NEGATIVE
"The day I received this laptop, found out it is heating up too much. Immediately, contacted Dell support through chat and they guided me to do some diagnostic tests and said there is nothing wrong with the laptop. When I asked, 'Why the laptop is burning hot?' there is no answer. When I requested to send a technician, they denied and asked me to take the laptop to the service center. I did not buy new laptop to waste my time to take it to the service center. Now the laptop screen freezes. It does not boot sometimes and hence I have to push power button for 20 seconds in order to boot. Also, while booting, it often takes to recovery screen saying, ""Windows did not shut down properly' or 'Windows did not load properly'. Instead of using chat support service, I called customer service last week over phone and they said they would send a technician. I am hoping the technician is able to identify the issue and fix it.",NEGATIVE

Dell vostro is a very very good laptop. It is a gaming laptop.,POSITIVE
I came back to x86 after facing some compatibility issues with ARM64 laptops. This one meets all my expectations. The performance is topnotch and battery backup is great too.,POSITIVE
"Here’s what i’ve learnt in the last two months of owning this. Apart from a few minor snags, the value for money for this level of performance is frankly obscene. Battery life is impressive for a windows laptop, gives a good 8 hours on flights when on whisper mode, battery saver and low brightness. In normal use, 5-6hours. Trickle charges on light use when on a phone power bank, so 24+ hours on a flight with one of those. Speaker quality is crazy, as for some light gaming it’s runs forza high settings 1080p at 90fps. AMD frame generation does help with that, but not by a lot. Soldered ram does not have an upgrade path, but 24GB is quite sufficient. Bottom-firing speakers, with the ai volume boost feature are absolutely killer, but only when placed on a solid tabletop. They are only second to some and not all macbooks in my experience. Screen looks amazing, 3K 120Hz and OLED definitely does not disappoint. Mb pro killer in every way, save the battery life and maybe the speakers. The processor, has an equivalent cinebench score with a ryzen 7800x3d, while consuming a fourth of the power. Similar story with the 890M integrated graphics, comparable opencl score with 3050 mobile. insane.  Only drawbacks are the stock m.2 500GB ssd, which can ofcourse be upgraded, and the mediatek wireless card. This isn’t mentioned anywhere enough, it’s absolute garbage. Network drops and funny bluetooth and wifi behaviour is common. To the point i’m considering swapping in the pcie network card with the realtek one from my old laptop, and then changing the nescessary drivers.  That and a 2tb kioxia or samsung m.2 drive is all which is needed to convert this laptop to a beast.  An amazing buy for me personally, a good upgrade path. No other laptops remotely offered such a price to performance, as of november 2024 when i bought it. It’s a similar scene now in Jan 2025, although that’s bound to change with AMD’s new strix point chips, but those laptops won’t be here for atleast another month. But who cares, my (this) laptop has strix point chips too, the currently leading generation of mobile chips.",NEGATIVE
"I was in doubt about it's built quality. But once I received it I was amazed by its built quality, display quality. One of the best in this segment.",POSITIVE
"Build quality is really solid. Keyboard feels great to use, OLED screen has top-tier HDR support. Gives me 11 hours of battery life. My only nitpick is that I would've liked a USB-C port on the right side too, so I can put the charger if I need to.",POSITIVE
"Awesome laptop. Pros: Great display and 16:10 aspect ratio rocks for coding. Really good sound for a portable non mac(with audio boost enabled from asusu settings) Mad cpu performance (beats mac m2 pro!!) Gpu performance is good for igpu. But heating needs to be considered for non whisper modes. AI speakers and mic is magic! Easily removes all background noise from your mic and ALSO FROM THE OTHER SIDE in calls.  Cons: Buggy drivers for display. Sometimes might freeze. Poor wifi reception. Weird behaviour of dolby Atmos that it doesn't support effects on bluetooth devices!  Tips for best usage in Indian climate: If normal productivity usage, you can use full speed/perf mode plugged in and balanced/whisper mode on battery. If playing games/rendering etc: use whisper mode on battery(gives max gpu performance) and balanced/whisper mode while plugged in.",NEGATIVE

Major flaw of the laptop - This model has ports in the back unlike what's shown in the picture. There's an issue with the placement of the hall sensor that has caused many of these models to not wake up when the laptop lid is opened up. Please beware of this and try to not buy this model.,NEGATIVE

"I bought this laptop as a Daily Driver for my mother, on average she uses the device for web surfing, media consumption, and Office Suite for work.  Pros: ->Low Cost ->Not a lot of bloatware ->Sturdy Build ->NVMe SSD ->Upgradability in terms of RAM(up to 32GB [2 slots]) and Sata Hardisk Slot Available ->Windows 11 Home License  Cons: -> The Ryzen 3 3250U processor is 4 years old at this point and that sort of shows when using the device for anything other than the bare minimum. -> The Device Heats up fast and the fan keeps on running ->Battery Life is Passable (can't complain about the segment) ->Windows 11 Home Edition is a drain on the system resources primarily the processor and the RAM Usage(it takes up a lot and slight lag shows when using Chrome with a lot of tabs) ->The color saturation & contrast on the screen is a little disappointing and the internal speakers, and webcam are no better... They're Passable for work though  Good to know about this device: ->The USB-C cannot drive a monitor as it does not support display signal pass-through.  If you have the budget, I'd suggest going for a newer generation of Ryzen 3 or Core Series 11th Gen or Higher.  If you decide on going with this device you'll need to purchase extra RAM (at least 8GB [which makes the total RAM on the device 16GB]) and add an extra 1TB Sata SSD, which would increase the total storage capacity to around 1.2 TB  Note: Delete the default Fan control software that comes with it, after that create a new Power Plan and use High Performance in all of its options.... Otherwise it'll thermal throttle to 15% of processor speed when the powercord is not connected.",NEGATIVE
"I purchased this Laptop in Nov'23. The product arrived with a dodgy looking Chinese charger which is definitely not a genuine Acer product. From the very beginning, the Laptop is extremely slow and takes almost 3 mins to boot up. On top of that, it crashes and the Blue Screen appears at least once in every 2-3 days. I mainly got this Laptop for my mother to do some light browsing and occasional Zoom calls with relatives in other parts of the world. So, it doesnt have any heavy softwares except the basic ones like MS Office, PDF Reader, Zoom, MS Teams etc etc, but still it runs poorly. At times when the charger is attached and the power is switched on, the underside of the Laptop heats up excessively and the fan starts making sound as if an old pedestal fan is running. Its been only 6 months since we are using this Laptop and are regretting buying this product. So, if you are looking for a Laptop for some more serious work, then think twice (even thrice, maybe) before purchasing it. Go for a more reputed and established brand instead..",NEGATIVE
good,POSITIVE
"The laptop is good and functions well as expected in all areas. The rest of the feedback is quite similar to what others have written. Let me focus on something that I have experienced uniquely.  I bought this device on 31 Mar 2024, but when I checked the warranty instead of 12 months I found only 1 month of warranty was remaining. HP Customer Service said that the dealer must have purchased this device 1 year ago and hence the warranty is coming to an end. Now since 12 April 2024, I have been struggling with HP Customer Service to get proper 12 months of warranty for me. After numerous calls, emails, and escalation to the HP Service Head, I was finally able to get a complete 12 months of warranty.  This was a PATHETIC experience buying this HP device. The seller/dealer on Amazon must know about this kind of trouble the end customers are facing due to the expiring warranty on their dead stocks.",NEGATIVE
Value for Money Paid....,POSITIVE

"As a first-time laptop user, the Dell 15 has exceeded my expectations with its excellent performance and versatile features. I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.  **Performance and Display:** Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.  **Portability and Build Quality:** Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.  **Value for Money:** At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.  **Future Updates:** I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.  **Final Thoughts:** Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.  Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body 👅 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter. Zero rupees replacement! Just call customer care and told everything! Within 2 days engineer visit and fixed it!, check my images and videos.  Overall laptop is great 😸! I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..",POSITIVE

"I recently purchased a Dell laptop from Amazon, expecting a hassle-free experience. Unfortunately, the laptop had significant issues with sound and audio quality. Upon reaching out to Amazon customer support, a technician troubleshot the issue and confirmed it was a defective product. The technician assured me that the laptop would be returned the next day.  However, I was unable to track the return process. When I followed up with customer support, I was told that I needed to visit a Dell service center to obtain a ""declined support letter"" from Dell, which confirms that Dell would not service the defective product.  This entire process is both frustrating and illogical. My purchase was from Amazon, and I bought a brand-new product. Why should I be responsible for visiting a Dell service center? If I wanted to rely on in-person service, I would have purchased the laptop from a physical outlet instead of Amazon.  This experience has been incredibly disappointing. I highly recommend against purchasing electronic items from Amazon. Their service has significantly declined, making it a frustrating experience for customers when dealing with defective products.",NEGATIVE
"I’m really happy with the laptop I bought on Amazon – it’s fast, efficient, and great for everyday use. The quality exceeded my expectations for the price!",POSITIVE
"1. Yes, MS Office is lifetime free with this 2. Yes the battery lasts for quite a few hours 3. The quality of material used looks very attractivee 4. it has all the features listed by Preferred Seller 5. One design flaw is that all the three USB drive ports are together next to each other, not a major problem 6. Laptop cannot heat up if you select ""balanced"" in Lenovo Vantage computer management instead of Rapid Charge 7. Yes, you get two years Warranty if you activate your laptop online at Lenovo website 8. This is Windows 11 Operating System and there are Many new features in Windows 11, so explore the Tips and everything will work perfectly 9. McAfee anti-virus offers a heavy discount for the first year and it is a good bargain to install it at least for the first year. 10. Front speakers with Dolby sound is great to listen to 11. The camera can be adjusted for image quality and microphone also works very well when talking to Alexa or Cortana.  All in all its a great hardware and everyday the price has been coming down during January Sales period",POSITIVE

"Overall, the product is quite good, but the battery drains rather quickly. Even after closing all background apps, the battery still depletes at a fast rate.",NEGATIVE
Product is good their tech support team is very cooperative and helped us in setting up the laptop.,POSITIVE
Excellent,POSITIVE
Pros: Premium build quality using aluminium Backlit keyboard Fast and no unnecessary pre-installed applications. opening lid switch on the system. Awesome screen and good audio quality in speaker.  Cons: No finger print but windows hello feature compensate for that.  Overall very good laptop for programming and media consumption.,POSITIVE
"What's the processor,here are showing two different types processor in the discription ,at one place core ultra 5 125H and another place Core ultra 7 155H ,kindly clarify",NEGATIVE
The laptop is very good. In product details both ultra 5 and ultra 7 processors have been mentioned but it actually has ultra 5 processor.,POSITIVE

Premium Laptop by Lenovo..Starting time is about 5 seconds.Very awesome and slim. very fast.,POSITIVE
Thanks to amazon for giving massive discount on my sbi card during republic day sale which made it possible for me to get this beast. It performs as you think it would. Everything runs buttery smooth but there is battery drop issue i think 230w adapter will fix that aside from that there is not problem and rgb backlight keyboard would have been cool.,NEGATIVE
So the best thing about this laptop is that the build quality is sturdy. Do note that this processor has no iGPU so your battery life is limited to 4 hours and does not go higher than that when not plugged in. That being said a friend of mine got the G14 zyphrus and we were gaming at max settings and this laptop did not hit 60 degrees whereas the G14 was touching 85 degrees hence the cooling system is amazing. Another thing I have realised is that I don’t use the laptop when it isn’t plugged in and I do not require 15 -20 hrs of battery life. Also all tasks and jobs run very smoothly on this and I feel its worth the trade off for price and hardware,POSITIVE
"Got it at 71k, faced a screen flickering issue after 2 days but other than that it worths every single penny in terms of display and gaming. It has better display and gaming performance then nitro and victus.",NEGATIVE
"As people have mentioned previously, the main issue is due to unavailablity of iGPU which spoils the battery life. Overall a decent laptop and worth the price.  I’ll edit my comms after using it for a couple of months",NEGATIVE
So far i am really satisfied with my Laptop. Yes there are some things that could have been better. Like the brightness could have been better. But the colour accuracy and all is good. The build is noce. Speaker quality is good not so bad but could have been better. It is on a heavier side but you know it is a gaming laptop. Many people complaint about the fan noise but i think most of the gaming laptops have this thing. It is just to keep your machine cool you can ignore that. The fan speed can be kept in quiet mode in normal usage. Battery life if you ask me lasted for 2.5-3hrs but i saw a minor charge drop while i was using heavily. 170w charger is not enough. J suggest you contact the customer care and get a 230w one. I bought it for ₹69k during republic day sale. I think its worth every penny.,NEGATIVE
A fully charged laptop dies in just one hour of Bubble game. I bought a gaming laptop for it's efficiency. But never expected such a low quality battery in such a new age laptop. How will I travel with this kinda of a laptop. How will I do anything at all if the battery does not last even an hour. Am I expected to stay plugged in all the time ?? I am disappointed. Why are they selling such low quality laptops or even making them for that matter. Useless.,NEGATIVE
Everything is very good but battery is equally bad,NEGATIVE
I would suggest to wait for some sale and go for 4060 with 7-8k more else you might regret when games like GTA 6 drops! Click on my profile to see gaming laptop idealist for more choices.,NEGATIVE

Nice product and quality is good,POSITIVE
I like this product it is very helpful but one problem is that for 16.5inch laptop it creates problem while closing the lower one not allow to close the screen fully,NEGATIVE
"I am extremely pleased with this product. Sure it is made of plastic, so what? I paid very little for it; so for the amount of money I paid, it's a product that suits my needs perfectly. It is sturdy enough to hold my 15"" laptop and does not slide down the stand. I can also adjust it to numerous different heights - love the additional mobile phone stand. Very nice-looking. There is nothing to the installation - LOL. Just unfold and use it. Extremly portable. Only one complaint - the lower lip could have been a cm higher as my laptop slides down, but only at times.  I heartily recommend this product to anyone considering it.",POSITIVE
"Height adjustment is fine. We can adjust as per our requirement. Works well. Built quality is strong. Grip is also good, doesn't slide. Very portable, can be taken anywhere. Not so heavy. The mobile stand is not that much useful. Difficult to take out mobile stand when stand is closed. But overall, it's easy to use.",POSITIVE

Good laptop for professional user and light weight you don't even feel that you carried a laptop in your bag. SSD is powerfull so bootup time is around 10 to 12 seconds. Silver color feels like premium. Value for money.,POSITIVE

"I am writing this review after using the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Ultra 5, for almost two months! Here are some opinions that I feel might help others trying to choose the right laptop for your needs!  1. The biggest advantage and comfort of this laptop has been it's unmatched battery backup! Being a researcher, I usually use a lot of powerpoint and word, along with a data analysis softwares. Sometimes I use them the for almost 15hrs straight, and it never occured that I had to keep it on charge or charge the laptop multiple times. One charge to 100% is enough to keep you going for atleast 15-18hrs, which is so relieving!  2. The second biggest tick, is the screen quality, the colors are vibrant and the display is super clear, which comes in to handy in keeping you hinged to the laptop. The blue light filter works really good demanding very few instances of wanting to take a break!  3. The other feature that comes in handy is the sufficient storage capacity and speed of the processor! You could experience the perks of either of these features on regular usage of the laptop.  4. The weight of the laptop, at 1.2Kgs is a relishing takeaway, as it's easy to carry around and work on the go, if needed!  5. The only concern is the laptop retains a lot of fingerprint on its screen and surface, which requires you to clean the laptop frequently, almost twice a day!  6. The second concern is the camera, the quality gets a little dim., at times. However, once you clean the area of the camera, it does get a little better.  7. Another concern that's worth noting is, there's only a single USB socket in the laptop, when you connect the USB of your mouse, you cannot plug in the pendrive, unless it has a type C feature in it! Two USB sockets could be good!  If I had to rate it based on my experience, I would say, it's totally worth the buy, as there is nothing much to regret but definitely a lot to relish about!  Personally, I would give it an 8/10.",NEGATIVE
I was very careful while choosing laptop in this price segment because the only option I have is Intel's i3 or ryzen's 3 that too u series but then I got this offer at 37K only ryzen 5 + 7000 series although we have less cores with this chipset but it has a decent performance for this price.,POSITIVE
"Laptop build & quality is very good,,,  Delivery was also fast and in good condition, thanks Team Amazon.",POSITIVE
Product quality is awesome in this price range. Performance and usability is unbeatable.,POSITIVE
Average product.. Average CPU.. Just 4 cores a d 8 threads. You should get atleast a Hexa core at this price. Expected a atleast an IPS display t this rate.. This is not ideal for any kind of media consumption or games. So the complimentary game pass seems useless.  Concerned to install any major apps on this.  Build quality and size is good. And design is attractive.  Overall the laptop is only good for some normal MS office work... I'm sure it will slow down significantly over time.,NEGATIVE
"Laptop is nice and decent performance for this price range. However, the charger is big 3pin type heavy and bulky. The charger could have been small and light weight.",NEGATIVE
Display is not good not recommended for students,NEGATIVE
"People might say it’s zen 2 processor and not as fast but it is the latest processor with 4 core 8 threads and all are performance cores. And all the things In the laptop are latest like WiFi 6e, ddr5 ram with 5500 mhz. This is a very good professional laptop for students as well as professionals with good battery backup and great performance . Also the 14 inch form factor is perfect to carry and since it has military certification it will last long . Over all this asus vivobook go 14 ryzen 5 7520u is best laptop under 40k . Go for it without doubt you will not regret it",POSITIVE

"* material and finish is a premium class like 1+ lakh laptop(Samsung galaxy book 4)  * very light weight around 1.4 kg.  * the type-C is a thunderbolt which can be used in display output and data transfer and all USB accessories  * the display quality of this laptop is out of the box. nice colors and also nice viewing angels and brightness is decent but because of the anti reflective coting it's a nice bright in outdoor also.  * keyboard is fantastic I'd say.  * trackpad's quality is nice but the size is decent not too small.  * PERFORMANCE: the CPU performance of this laptop is again out of the box Cinebench r23 scores around 1518 in single core and 7080 in multi core which is almost same as apple m1 cinebench 2024 scores around 96 in single core and 480 in multi core which is almost same as apple m1 geekbench 6 scores around 2240 in single core and 9230 in multi core which is ahead to apple m1  * GPU: it's average not for gaming and 4k editing, but you can do 1080p editing easily without any issues. video rendering test: 4k 1 minute video took 1 minute and 1-8 frame per second which lower than apple m1 which gives you 5-13 frames per second And in 1080p you will find 70-100 frames per second.  * RAM management of this laptop is crazy. you'll never find any issue with it. multitasking (100 chrome tabs, 5 any heavy software and video conference) test: these all runes fast and non stoppable.  * storage is enough.  * you can connect two earbuds at the same time. and honor application and features  * Thermals controls is very good in normal usage no heating problem and in heavy usage you'll find normal temperature increasement.  * fan noise in light usage isn't even hearable and in heavy usage slightly noise.  * audio is louder but the quality is average( around better than 95% windows laptop)  * microphone quality is decent.  * webcam test is good.  * battery life is not that good, you'll get around 3-4 hours of battery life in light usage at 30% brightness.  * charging speed is good.  * ahh. let's talk about the conclusion. so....... even if you're getting this laptop at price of 49k this is the world leading deal. there is a not any laptop which provide this kind of specs at this price.  you can get Lenovo laptop at this price with same processor but the display and speaker quality will be worst than ever.",POSITIVE
"There's no ms office inbuilt. 42 Wh battery last upto 5 hours continuously battery life , no fingerprint sensor, better in fan to reduce heat level, awesome build quality, it's really value for money , good looking",POSITIVE
"1) there is no backlit keyboard 2) There is no dedicated enter key in numerical keyboard side. 3) there is no fingerprint sensor 4) There is no dedicated print screen key.  Also, I went to upgrade and add extra storage, the computer centre told me that this model doesn't have an extra slot to increase its hard disk memory; only the original SSD can be replaced with an increased memory size, and the old one needs to be removed for that. Also, RAM is fixed at 16 GB and can't be increased. This laptop also has very limited connecting ports.  Battery time: Now after use of 6 months, the battery finishes within half an hour.  So product not recommended, buy Dell or Asus or other good products which can be upgraded to higher storage, have dedicated buttons and more battery power.",NEGATIVE
"I recently had the pleasure of using this product, and I’m thoroughly impressed with both its performance and build quality. The device operates smoothly and efficiently, handling tasks with speed and ease. Whether it's multitasking or running more demanding applications, it performs without any noticeable lag or stuttering.  The build quality is equally exceptional. It feels solid and durable in hand, with attention to detail evident in its design. The materials used are premium, giving it a sleek, polished finish that also feels sturdy enough to withstand daily use. Overall, it’s clear that a lot of thought and care went into the construction, ensuring that this product not only performs at a high level but also stands the test of time.  For anyone looking for a reliable, well-made product that delivers great performance, this is definitely a top contender. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE

"I purchased this a month back, 1. Display quality is awesome 2. Its i5, H processor and 16GB RAM - Speed is awesome 3. Only thing to keep in mind is, Honor has no service in India. Keeping in mind - Honor is top brand in Japan/China/Korea, if we keep it safe then enjoy the performance as much you can :)  Its more than expected for 40k laptop. regular laptop with this configuration costs more than 50k.",POSITIVE
"Best laptop in this price range everything is fantastic , display size and quality, sound, performance but battery backup is 2.3 to 3 hours",POSITIVE
"It's been 3 months since I am using this laptop, and I am extremely happy with it's performance, and it's speed is good, light- weight, and decent sound quality, appearence is classy, and battery doesn't last for 4 hrs. Overall good, just go for it.",POSITIVE
Have charging issue in new laptop my badluck have to wait another 10 days for re order. Totally harassment by Amazon I have book the return .even after 10 days no body came to pick the parcel. Even talk to customer care several time that no body came to pick up.after all they did not do anything.,NEGATIVE
It's not been even year and my keyboard is not functioning correctly due to which my laptop screen keeps getting scrolled down automatically and i claim the warranty I don't know what's wrong with amazon and the dealer they said they will be contacting me soon and it's been three days still no update ...very bad service,NEGATIVE
Good product. But got it with a small scratch on the laptop.,NEGATIVE

"So 1st of all I got this laptop in 41000 during Amazon Great Indian festival.  Now about the laptop. I got this laptop delivered in 9 days which can be considered a ling period but fine by me.The outer box was damaged but inside it was all perfect, so no problem with that.I Don't think this will be a decision maker and please don't make it one  Looks amd design are the best , literally it looks cool and 14 inches make it most beautiful.  ok, now , before buying the laptop I saw many critics of display, but tbh yeah the display is not that ""oled or wuxga quality but as a student I have no problem,like it is pretty normal screen very normal,so if you have very high quality display needs then don't buy this but if you are student or evrn a working professional like me, so yeah the critics were somewhat right but its ok to be honest, it will do the job.  Now battery, now this one is tough to answer, I saw one comment which said 1 hr battery life, ohk yes the battery life is low, but not 1 hr, here is what I have found after using for 10 days:  2 hr battery: intense gaming (played honkai rail star, rocket league, genshin impact, can play valorant too)  3.5-4.5 hrs: Net surfing and video streaming  5hr-6 hr : pdf and book reading (which I as a student use it most for)  See it is a H grade processor,but it is okay guys, chill, it has fast charing too, but I don't use it, cuz yeah ""dell"" in its laptop says the battery health gets depleted,so it must be true for lenovo too.  Processor: It is i5 12th gen BUT a H GRADE , SO IT HAS GAMING CAPABILITY,I played games, it does the work but don't think you will give you performance like dedicated gpu) bit it is faster than 13th gen U processor (you can see the scores online), but yeah the battery life is low due to this only. So yeah again normal-normal.  Hardware is top notch, the keyboard quality is good.  So all in all it is very good laptop, it will get all your normal needs done, go for it ,you will get it in 45k in sale.",NEGATIVE
"Light weight easy to carry, good processor for day to day office work with home 11 and Ms office pre installed. Screen brightness is decent indoor but speaker is pathetic so not recommended for multimedia use case. If you want a laptop for office work with low budget below 50k go for it. I got it for 39k with bank office in great Indian sales and satisfied with it.",NEGATIVE
"Don't Buy this Product. Horrible Experience with Amazon and Lenovo.. - Within 10 days of purchase, display started showing horizontal lines. - Lenovo service center accepted it as hardware issue but they would only replace the part & not replacing the entire product.. This only means, they sent 2nd quality product/refurbished product which got issue within 10 days. Amazon is selling these kind of products online. - While Amazon Customer Service team tried helping but they couldn't get through replacing product as it crossed 7 days period. - Equally disappointed with both Amazon and Lenovo. Will have to be careful buying any electronic items from amazon going forward..",NEGATIVE
Very bad screen quality and viewing angle,NEGATIVE
After using it for a day - Display : pretty good Speakers - Below average Battery life - Good Camera - Good Performed well in dead pixel and keyboard functionality test. Overall amazing laptop for the price .....,POSITIVE
Does my job without any hiccups. Happy with the purchase.,POSITIVE
Quality and functionality is smooth. Seems best product and got it for 40k during the sale. Battery life is good. Camera quality and sound is just Ok.,POSITIVE
Good product Working very well Service support is good.,POSITIVE
"I read a lot of reviews about this laptop, so I was aware that it would be slow and that there would be a heating problem, which is understandable given its low price. You can't expect it to perform like a laptop that costs 50,000 INR. I did face issues: it is slow, it heats up a little on the left side of the keyboard, the battery backup is not good, and there is problem while watching videos. I bought it because I wanted to use it for browsing and occasionally using MS Office.  After 12 days of usage, I received an update, and when I tried to install it, the laptop wouldn't turn on. I'm lucky that this happened before the expiration of the replacement period.  I would suggest everyone to buy branded laptops, even if they don’t have Windows 11 or powerful processors and RAM. For 12 days, it worked fine, though it wasn’t on par with an i5 or better processors. If I compare it with my 9 years old I5 5th generation laptop then more or less both are same.  Apart from the product another worst thing is the delivery which takes 1 week. Don't be under the assumption that we get Amazon's product before expected date.  I faced the same issue even after getting replacement. This is totally a useless product. If you can use it without updating you can take a risk of buying.",NEGATIVE
"Chuwi laptops offer excellent value for budget-conscious buyers. They feature simple designs, decent displays, and solid battery life, making them ideal for basic tasks like web browsing and word processing. Performance is suitable for light use but struggles with demanding applications. A great choice for casual users on a budget.",POSITIVE
"Loved the built quality of the laptop. The screen is perfect and the packaging is amazing. I would recommend for basic use - Internet, MS office, Emails, youtube etc. Please don't buy if you are a gamer and if you need heavy usage. The camera is great and it's value for money. Battery life is good and the display screen is very well. Sound is nice too. Functionality wise it would perform less than an i3 but it's good.",POSITIVE
Good product,POSITIVE
Mouse paid not proper work,NEGATIVE
"Laptop not working properly, can't claim it under warranty ,poor quality laptop sold by Amazon, vendor cannot be trusted, I need my refund, pls take back laptop as it is nt even used for 15 days, this vendor cannot be trusted.",NEGATIVE
"Totally worth the money. Surprisingly good. Anyone who want a laptop just for attending lectures, online coaching, msoffice can buy this blindly. Battery backup is more than 6 hours normal use. If U remove bloatware, reduce animations, U can clock 10hours battery backup. Best in India under 15000, for laptop markets.",NEGATIVE
Very light in weight and excellent quality product. I am using it for last 4 months and never faced any problems.,POSITIVE

It’s been one week since I have bought this damn laptop. Its processor is slow. You cannot work in multiple tabs,NEGATIVE
It’s a pure plastic build. Very bad experience when touch the product,NEGATIVE
The product features are best what you can get in this price.,POSITIVE
Appearance and performance are good. Display is fine but sound quality is not that satisfactory. You need additional app for better sound quality.,NEGATIVE
The laptop seems ok butThe charger is worst. I stopped working within a month of purchase and I got it replaced. The replacement stopped working within a week. Complete garbage of a product.,NEGATIVE
Light and compact,POSITIVE
It doesn't have IPS display display so that you can notice negative images from corner 😞 Otherwise a good budget friendly laptop to buy with sheer performance,POSITIVE
Only thing that I didn’t like is the keyboard other than that everything is good under this budget.,NEGATIVE

"After 2 weeks of purchase iam writing this review Battery backup is good, performance is also good no lags,but sometimes fingerprint sensor is not capturing.with 65w charger around one and half an hour it is full charged.spekaers also good but not loud.",POSITIVE
"I had been using this more than a month now for Full Stack development, I cant be more happy than this, got the beast only for 80k, Its too cheap to get i9 13th gen in this budget, first i thought Its having some problem, but since day 1 perfomance had been top notch, I thought there will be heating issue but I havent found it, neither any sound of fan so far. I always use laptop connected to power (which is recomemded) so cant say anything about battery life, but if possible we should always pefer using any laptop connected to power instead of charging and discharging every now and then which reduces battery life. My last Asus i5 lasted 7years daily 9am-911pm lets see with this i9, fingers crossed.",NEGATIVE
"The display quality is poor. Don't buy it. Prioritise display over processor. Anyway, most of the time you won't be able to utilise the i9 processor fully.",NEGATIVE
Very nice product,POSITIVE
I you want to purchase the pc for multitasking then it is the best choice. It performs heavy-to-heavy tasks with out any problem. Getting i9 processor at this price range makes this the best choice.,POSITIVE
Performance is at top notch. This is good configuration upgrade for non gamer and processor is upto mark with m3,POSITIVE
"Before going to buy this laptop, you must check my review  1) when I received the laptop by seeing it am very happy, but when I charged it took 4hrs to full and to discharge it took 1hr 2) when am connecting the charger to the laptop the display gets black screen 3) after using 1day, on 2nd day it automatically got blank screen and it asked for recovery of the windows, with blue screen. 4) when I asked for replacement, the amazon team arranged a technical team visit, but they didn't visited, I waited for 6days and they said that ""as the customer is not reachable, we are rescheduling the visit"" they daily reschedule the visit. 5) the most important thing is on the 1st time schedule""the technician called me and forced me to tell the otp, and he will not visit the customers place, he want me to tell the otp and he will update it to replace or refund. I asked him to tell me whenever he will be free to schedule the visit, he told me that ""he will be available on the next year"" with a sarcastic tone. I told him I will complaint if you speak like this, he told ""do whatever you want""  The way the technician speaking with the customer is a worst than ever I have seen. 6) when I called to amazon customer care they scheduled for return pickup, after contacting daily to customer care finally after 11 days it got picked up and refunded after 3 days.",NEGATIVE
"Excellent product condition. It looks brand new. Eventhough the packing, battery, charger are not lenovo, the performace and everything is excellent.. Need to wait and see further days to see the performance. For me it was 2019 mid year laptop. Local market、you wont get this quality/spec at this price.  But first impression is now the best impression. Wait n see..  Thank you amazon and the seller. I will update further if i face any issues in future. Hope, everything will be alright.",POSITIVE

"The keyboard has completely stopped working, battery doesn’t last an hour. They know what they are selling and nothing will happen for 10 days, possibly a month. After that issues will start popping up. And the issues are unlike any I have ever seen. Sound stops suddenly, hopefully it is back once you restart. Key board currently has stopped working but before it stopped all letters got mapped to different keys. And the support link to raise a ticket is switched off for the company",NEGATIVE

Product is in nice condition,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this laptop, and while it performs well in most aspects, I’ve encountered an issue that’s quite frustrating. Whenever I plug in or unplug the charger, the screen goes black for a few seconds before returning to normal.  This interruption affects my workflow, especially when switching between charging and battery modes during use. I would appreciate it if the seller or manufacturer could address this issue or provide a solution.  Other than this, the laptop seems to function as expected. However, this problem makes it difficult to fully recommend the product without a fix.",NEGATIVE

Performance-wise, it handles multitasking smoothly — I’ve been using it for everything from browsing, streaming, to working on canvas on graphic design projects and it hasn’t slowed down once. The processor is fast and the SSD ensures quick boot times. Battery life is also impressive, lasting me through most of my workday without recharging.  The display is crisp and clear, perfect for watching movies or working on detailed projects. The keyboard feels comfortable and the trackpad is responsive. The sound quality is decent for a laptop, although I tend to use headphones for a better experience.  Overall, this laptop offers great value for the price and I would highly recommend it to students, professionals or anyone looking for a reliable and efficient laptop.",POSITIVE
"If you want to kill yourself out of frustration because the laptop is not working well and keeps shutting off itself, then go ahead and buy. Sincerely it doesn’t deserve any star.",NEGATIVE
This laptop is perfect for both work and entertainment. The sleek design makes it easy to carry and the display is sharp and vibrant. The sound quality is also better than I expected in this amount. I appreciate the quick boot-up time and the storage space. It's definitely worth the investment if you're looking for a reliable and stylish laptop.,POSITIVE

Don't think much. I am using this for last three days. It is really impressive. Value for money. Battery durability is around 6 to 7 hours average. Sound quality is good. Brightness is good. But the display quality is not for entertainment purposes. It doesn't have IPS pannel. But it's good for working. Don't think much. You can buy it. There's no heating issue.,POSITIVE

Performance is good,POSITIVE
Battery 🔋 health not working,NEGATIVE
"Got it for around 68k in sale and after using it for a month now there are some things which I found - 1) Performance is Top tier at this price. CPU will be a bottleneck in some cases as its a 13420H but will be fine for most used case scenarios. 2) Battery is OK 3) A little bit of false advertising saying it contains wifi 6E as shown in the attached photo but I checked and it has Wifi 6 Ax203. Most people won't notice the difference though. 4) Display is just ok. Can't complain at this price as all other laptops in this price segment give similar displays. Colors are really unnatural but in Display settings->Advanced Display-> Turn on ""Automatically manage colors for apps"". It will be fine after that. 5) Fans are loud yes but you can actually set custom speeds for fans easily, so I see no issue here. They are generally quiet when not gaming 6) Tried Cyberpunk 2077 at ultra and I must say it was a delight 7) No heating problems 8) Looks are nice, I wanted something which looks simple and basic but packs a punch under its hood, perfect for me 9) Lighter in weight than my previous laptop, no issues for me. In the end- If performance is your priority, while also looking decent for office or college, it can be a really good choice. I heard i7 variant will launch soon and if that comes under 90k, it will be quite insane. P.S- One thing I don't like is 512gb ssd only, If they had a option of 1tb at a little premium, it would be perfect. Well, atleast it's Gen 4.",POSITIVE
"Pro's : 1. It's value for money ( I am a btech student ) . 2. It's more portable and attractive than I had thought. 3. It's design in very classy ( not gaming one ) 4. It is sturdy but not sure about its lifespan . 5. Beautiful keyboard with white backlight numpad and bigger trackpad. 6. No overheating.  Cons : 1. Battery life is awful 😞, sometimes it shows 1.8 hors battery left in 85% battery. 2. Sound quality is good but dts is just on but not making any difference at all, even Equalizer is not working , it looks like a gimmick.  Overall display is average and manageable , it does not let it down ,  But , if you want better build with 90 whrs battery life , Dolby audio , mux switch, etc and especially gaming looks , go for Asus tuf 15 i5 12500h rtx 3050  And if you want a professional looking laptop with better internal specs and don't do gaming that much like me ( use for btech ) , you should go for it.",NEGATIVE
"Dont think abt whether to buy it or not.. in this orice range its is a beast.. performs so well... And the thermals are just amazing... It doesnt heats too much even in heavy tasks... Its light weight and very hood looking.. battery life is also good.. had acer provided it with a coloured backlight rather than the white one, then it would have been looking even more good.. screen is bright also.. no issues in that as you might have seen on yt... As of display quality its more than good for me.. coz i dont have to do colour sensitive work.. i have heared some people complain abt colours, but maybe their work is highly colour specific so maybe they might be using a even better display.. if you want it for normal work, gaming, game development then this display wont let you down even a bit... Camera quality is also very good according to a gaming laptop  My model:-- 6gb rtx 4050... 16/512",POSITIVE
"Worked well for one year, was also maintaining the laptop in good condition. But after 1year ( tbh 1year 1month and 20 days later) the laptop turned off automatically and wasn't charging after that. Got to know that it was the motherboard issue. Now have to spend a lot since the warrenty also got over.",NEGATIVE
"I bought acer predator in 2018,at 60 k in an offer,and after 6 years when I was thinking of buying a value for money gaming laptop,I couldn't see a better one than Acer Nitro v.it offers nvidia 4050 at such a low price,that I jumped in joy when it is available at 69 k ,in offer .I have used it for graphics heavy games .it runs like butter..the only minor complaints I got are the fan sound,and the audio quality.overall if i get a chance ,I would buy it again.i feel like 4050 will be valid for about 3 years.so if u are a Student looking for a value for money laptop for gaming go for it.",NEGATIVE
"The only reason i am giving this a 4/5 is it doesn't come with rgb lighting keyboard apart from that everything else about the laptop is just awesome.  The keyboard is good(the travel on it isn't perfect but it good you wont feel any compromises)  The overall build of the laptop is sturdy although being a polycarbonate build. Trackpad is large and supports all the windows gestures.  I havent felt any sort of lag while doing daily tasks.  The screen is okay its not the best but this is what you get in almost every laptop in this range which is built for gaming, avoid this laptop if you are into editing and color grading stuff for rest of you its alright you can go for it.  Comming to the last and most awaited aspect Gaming it kills it in 1080p gaming almost every title on high to ultra settings gives above 60 - 100 fps. I have done long gaming sessions on it and it doesn't heat a lot thanks to those fans that fire up when you start to game it keeps the chips cool.  In short buy it if have the budget.",NEGATIVE
Pros- °h series processor °better battery life compared to a gaming laptop °better look and build °amazing keyboard Cons °display quality is not too good but not that bad either °no mux switch °low performance on battery mode use charging mode for best performance °heating issue Tips- for switching your graphics use graphics option in display settings there you can dedicate igpu and dgpu for specific apps its alternative to mux switch... Overall review best for students to relief preesure and do work done faster by gaming and browsing.....,NEGATIVE

Hi I accidentally mentioned that I hadn’t received the product. That was actually a miscommunication. The product has been received. Thank you,POSITIVE
"The build is cheap and flimsy.  Ergonomically, it’s really bad, it creates more problem than it solves.  Even at the minimum, the incline is too much to be able to use the laptop comfortably. It’s straight up painful.  Does not really achieve it’s basic functionality, I have used other laptop stands which have been much better for me, ones which have actually helped with the posture problem.

The display is crisp and vibrant, and the performance is smooth for everyday tasks and even some intensive work. The fanless design keeps it silent, and the build quality feels premium.

"Got hands to MLXY3HN/A model, though not through Amazon. The M2 8GB 256GB was not available in Amazon but got a steal deal for 67490 INR in Flipkart. The product is amazing & upgraded from M1 2020 to M2 2022. The performance, display, speed, battery and everything is topnotch. There are only two things which I didn't like, but nothing related to performance. One, I ordered midnight black thinking that it will be a nice pure black colour, but it is a lot of bluish and not black. Second, the case finishing is prone to retain fingerprints easily and leaves a lot of marks of the body when you casually touch it.",POSITIVE

"So 1st of all I got this laptop in 41000 during Amazon Great Indian festival.  Now about the laptop. I got this laptop delivered in 9 days which can be considered a ling period but fine by me.The outer box was damaged but inside it was all perfect, so no problem with that.I Don't think this will be a decision maker and please don't make it one  Looks amd design are the best , literally it looks cool and 14 inches make it most beautiful.  ok, now , before buying the laptop I saw many critics of display, but tbh yeah the display is not that ""oled or wuxga quality but as a student I have no problem,like it is pretty normal screen very normal,so if you have very high quality display needs then don't buy this but if you are student or evrn a working professional like me, so yeah the critics were somewhat right but its ok to be honest, it will do the job.  Now battery, now this one is tough to answer, I saw one comment which said 1 hr battery life, ohk yes the battery life is low, but not 1 hr, here is what I have found after using for 10 days:  2 hr battery: intense gaming (played honkai rail star, rocket league, genshin impact, can play valorant too)  3.5-4.5 hrs: Net surfing and video streaming  5hr-6 hr : pdf and book reading (which I as a student use it most for)  See it is a H grade processor,but it is okay guys, chill, it has fast charing too, but I don't use it, cuz yeah ""dell"" in its laptop says the battery health gets depleted,so it must be true for lenovo too.  Processor: It is i5 12th gen BUT a H GRADE , SO IT HAS GAMING CAPABILITY,I played games, it does the work but don't think you will give you performance like dedicated gpu) bit it is faster than 13th gen U processor (you can see the scores online), but yeah the battery life is low due to this only. So yeah again normal-normal.  Hardware is top notch, the keyboard quality is good.  So all in all it is very good laptop, it will get all your normal needs done, go for it ,you will get it in 45k in sale.",NEGATIVE
"Light weight easy to carry, good processor for day to day office work with home 11 and Ms office pre installed. Screen brightness is decent indoor but speaker is pathetic so not recommended for multimedia use case. If you want a laptop for office work with low budget below 50k go for it. I got it for 39k with bank office in great Indian sales and satisfied with it.",NEGATIVE
"Don't Buy this Product. Horrible Experience with Amazon and Lenovo.. - Within 10 days of purchase, display started showing horizontal lines. - Lenovo service center accepted it as hardware issue but they would only replace the part & not replacing the entire product.. This only means, they sent 2nd quality product/refurbished product which got issue within 10 days. Amazon is selling these kind of products online. - While Amazon Customer Service team tried helping but they couldn't get through replacing product as it crossed 7 days period. - Equally disappointed with both Amazon and Lenovo. Will have to be careful buying any electronic items from amazon going forward..",NEGATIVE
Very bad screen quality and viewing angle,NEGATIVE
After using it for a day - Display : pretty good Speakers - Below average Battery life - Good Camera - Good Performed well in dead pixel and keyboard functionality test. Overall amazing laptop for the price .....,POSITIVE
Does my job without any hiccups. Happy with the purchase.,POSITIVE
Quality and functionality is smooth. Seems best product and got it for 40k during the sale. Battery life is good. Camera quality and sound is just Ok.,POSITIVE
"I am writing this review after using it for 2 months.  1. The laptop comes with License Windows 11 Home Single Language Operating system.  2. It comes with Free 1 year McAfee antivirus support. And also it has free lifetime support of Microsoft Defender Antivirus.  3. The speakers are pretty good. Played the audio video file and sounds decent.  4. It comes with Dell support assistant for timely updates on BIOS and other drivers updates.  5. This laptop comes with Free Lifetime License Microsoft office 2021, which is quite good.  6. Its battery backup is overall good, however if the brightness is maintained to 23%, it gives good battery backup.  Overall, the performance of the laptop is pretty decent for home and office use.",POSITIVE
Sound very good battery backup 5 quality good display,POSITIVE
From day 1 the key board wasn t working and it seems some piece are second hand from the technician point of view.After 2 weeks the sounds isn t working too.They refused to exchange the computer and sent a technical team.,NEGATIVE

Amazing Laptop for the price. A real deal,POSITIVE
Very poor video quality,NEGATIVE
"The laptop would be an excellent choice for students. Windows 11 (Home) is smooth and fast. For study and office works the laptops config is more than enough. Design very sleek, screen brightness ok, sound loud enough, Web Cam sufficient for video calls, fingerprint very responsive. MS Office 2021 included, which makes it an excellent choice for students. Value for money, recommended.",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop at effective price of 30000 with all the cashback etc. Which is reasonably well, considering nowadays phones of 8 gb Ram are also in the same price range.  Ofcourse there are some shortcomings but I understand why they are there. Manufacturer have to drop something to provide this laptop at great price. Really good for students who can't afford expensive laptops. Even 60-70 thousand laptops are not useful after a while. I'm intending to use this for 2 years, so I guess this will do the job  Pros: 1. Battery life is good, you can easily use it for 6 hours with average use. I suggest to use dark theme to further increase the battery life. 2. Performance is good, so far able to handle multi tasking. I tried copying data, the tranfer was super fast. 3. Build quality is good, considering a non- metallic back, it looks good, light and portable. 4. Camera Sutter is nice feature at this price point. 5. Finger print scanner. 6. Microsoft office licence.  Cons:  1. Speakers are useless, low volume. Taking meetings on this laptop would be difficult as well. Workaround is that to carry earphones all the time. 2. No USB charging, it would have been great. Now I have to carry two charges, one for phone and another for laptop. 3. Keyboard have lesser spacing inbetween the keys, I kept pressing wrong keys all the time. More surprising is the fact that there's 1 inch space left either side of the keyboard. Not sure why they squeeze keys in limited space. 4. Camera quality is also poor, looks like a camera from 2006 laptop. 5. Display is also really average, when you look at different angles it doesn't work that we'll. 6. Heating is also felt, I haven't started using the laptop, just exploring it still I could hear the fan running.",NEGATIVE
"Build Quality: 4/5 The laptop has excellent build quality. Although it doesn't feature a metal body, the polycarbonate material used is of good quality and feels sturdy.  Keyboard: 2/5 The keyboard feels uncomfortable to use. The build quality seems cheap, and it lacks aesthetic appeal. It does not provide a satisfactory typing experience, especially for someone who works extensively on a laptop.  Power Management: 2.5/5 Power management is just average. It neither excels in battery backup nor provides efficient usage for long durations. A mediocre performance overall in this department.  Display: 1/5 As someone with 10 years of IT experience and extensive exposure to different laptops, this display is by far the worst I have encountered. The quality is extremely poor, making it unsuitable even for basic tasks. This is a major drawback and a significant reason I would no longer consider ASUS laptops in this price range (₹26,000).  Performance: 3/5 The laptop is powered by an i3-1235U/1215U processor and 8GB of RAM. For the price, it's adequate for basic tasks such as video playback and office documentation. However, it is not built for multitasking or more demanding applications, which is understandable given the specifications.  Price: 3/5 Considering the display quality, even a price below ₹20,000 would not justify this purchase. There are better options available in this range, and the display alone makes it hard to recommend this laptop.  Overall: 2/5 This laptop has been a lifetime worst experience for me. The display is horrible—very bad quality, and the performance is just passable for basic tasks. Power management is average at best. Overall, this laptop fails to deliver value for its price and does not meet expectations, even as a budget device. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Asus Vivobook 14 and unfortunately, my experience has been quite frustrating. While the laptop initially seemed promising, I've encountered significant issues with the touchpad that has significantly impacted my overall satisfaction.  Touchpad Issues: * Inconsistent Tracking: The touchpad often exhibits inconsistent tracking, making it difficult to navigate smoothly and accurately. This can be particularly annoying when performing precise tasks or gaming. * Accidental Clicks: The touchpad is overly sensitive, leading to accidental clicks and cursor jumps. This can be frustrating and disruptive, especially when typing or working on documents. Other Concerns: While I haven't experienced any major performance issues, the build quality feels a bit flimsy for a laptop at this price point. The plastic casing doesn't inspire confidence in its durability.  Except this issue I have faced, there is another drawback of purchasing this laptop is keyboard is without backlit support but on App they mentioned that this laptop has backlit chiclet keyboard.  Conclusion: I'm disappointed with my purchase of the Asus Vivobook 14. The touchpad issue and non availability of backlit keyboard, have significantly hindered my enjoyment of the laptop. If you're considering this model, I would strongly recommend researching other options or carefully considering these potential drawbacks.",NEGATIVE
"Very good product, I afraid to see most of the reviews, but it's must buying product. Amazon packing is amazing. Thank you Amazon for this type of service. Fingerprint sensor is amazing and Full HD screen is also good. Battery life is also good around to 5 hours, compared to other windows laptop",POSITIVE
"As mentioned in the advert page for this Lenovo laptop -- Windows 11 and office software not provided along with the purchase.. I have to purchase this software separately.. Pre-loaded windows OS had issues. When I contacted Lenov support, your laptop doesn't come with OS they told. For office Microsoft support told for the laptop serial # -- office software is not available they told. Amazon team doesn't support and irresponsible.",NEGATIVE
Product is as described on details page. Very light laptop. Just speaker sound is too low. You've to use external Bluetooth speaker if watching videos or listening music.,NEGATIVE
"The laptop has poor video/audio quality and stopped working just 10 days after delivery. Return of the product was scheduled on 20th Dec, but seems like Amazon is daily pushing it by one day. 20th to 21st to 22nd to 23rd to 24th now. Wonder if Amazon will keep up to this commitment at least.",NEGATIVE

"Reviewing after 1 month of usages!! First I'm confused about this laptop because of the negative review ,it's a great laptop for basic use & for professionals. Pros- -The build quality is good 👍🏻, - the design is very sleek smooth - keyboard quality and keys are good, ☺️ -Processor is beast very much satisfied , -Battery life is also average max 4 hr to 5 hr depends on usages , - lenovo service is so good I can say cause I noticed that my touchpad is sometimes lagging(coz of BIOS not uptodate) so I connect with the support team in lenovo offical website , he fixed it in just 10 mins! ☺️  CONS - Brightness is bit low have to set in 80 to100 range - speaker sound is average! - while charging the heating issue felt but not very much - only 60hrz refresh rate not satisfied - sometimes display wombling not much but little - backlit light is dim. Overall it'a good laptop ♥️ 4.5/5 If your priority is not gaming or editing then you can go for it! 👍🏻",POSITIVE
Almost using it for 5 days :-  Pros :- 👍👍 .) Build quality💥 .) Display worth the money .) Battery life - I got 7.5 hrs with normal usage ( offline movies + YouTube + Browsing + Pdf reading) with Wifi and Bluetooth turned on all the time...I kept brightness at 30% ( since It is sufficient for me in indoors ) and in dark mode... Another time I got only 5.5 hrs of battery life...so not sure of the exact battery span. .) Flip to start is very useful .) Booting time is only 10-15 secs max .) Performance is good for this budget .) Light weight and very convenient to use especially for studying  Cons :- 👎👎 .) Heating issue while charging😮‍💨 .) Sometimes it heats up even with normal usage .) Speaker is good but sound is low .) Missing fingerprint sensor/Facial recognition in this range  Tips :- .) Don't charge immediately after using for more hours...let the heat to cool down and then charge .) After charging let the heat to cool down..then start to use ( will Increase battery span )  Product got delivered b4 the due date...and packaging was good 👍  Conclusion : Simply go for it if you are a student and doesn't play that much of games💥,NEGATIVE
"Very good Investment. Battery, Performance, Display, Speaker excellent.",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop few days back. There was an issue with the screen so I had to return/replace it. The amazon guys has been lying from start. They said they were going to initiate a lenovo technician visit. I waited for 2 days, no one came so I called lenovo directly. They said they had no notification regarding any booking of technician visit.  Once I booked the technician visit in lenovo's side a visit was arranged. In the meantime amazon kept telling me that their hands are tied as long as the product is not sealed by lenovo. Once lenoco technician checks the project and gives no objection for return we will return/replace it immediately. Now it has been almost 2 weeks, everyday a return is created and gets cancelled saying the product was not ready when actually no one visited.  My biggest mistake was to buy it from amazon. The laptop is actually good. But directly from lenovo or may ve croma.",NEGATIVE
"It's very slim , The build is plastic but it's very tough , the display is FHD and it's a good display, The processer is actually a beast but you need to use it on charging to utilise it's full capacity , battery backup despite of having a H series processor and 48W Battery it performs very well and give you a 5hr screen on time the sound isn't too loud but if you keep it on your lap or so then you won't face any issue , And the main keypoint of this laptop is it's i7 13gen processor which is very very powerful but remember it has a intel UHD graphics so you are not going to play any graphics involving games it won't be a smooth experience overall a good product for real",NEGATIVE
"First of all thanks to Amazon for the fastest deliveries less than 24 hours with good shape. Now on the laptop front superb finish love at first sight, it is a clean laptop with all the essential features. Top lid is of metal a premium quality laptop with precise cut at each and every corner. It is a 12th Generation i5 - 12450H processor laptop due to which no issues at the processing of task no matter what you give, it run as a breeze, no fingerprint sensor, no graphics card it had a internal graphics card which is terrible if you want this laptop for gaming purpose then do not purchase this. I have purchased this as i have no use of graphics card.  Pros:  ASPECT RATIO: 16:10 ( Major highlight which is helpful in Coding ) SCREEN : IPS Panel with 60Hz resolution with good viewing angle. CHARGER: 65 Watt Charger with USB type C FRONT CAM: 720p with privacy shutter. SSD: 500 GB (with upgradable option) TRACK PAD : Very nice wide and smooth scroll with good tactile feedback. BACKLITE KEYBOARD : YES  Cons:  RAM: 16 GB ( not upgradable this is a major downside of this laptop which is so expensive) HDD: ( no slot for HDD ) FINGERPRINT : NO GRAPHICS CARD: Inbuilt  HEATING ISSUE:  Most important due to which I gave it a less rating since Lenovo knows it is a H series processor therefore vents should be cut out at the side end of the laptop but at present the vent is at the screen & bottom end due to which when performing high priority tasks it becomes hot as it is clocked at base 2.0 Ghz the keyboard area becomes hot and due to vents placed at screen side screen & metal lid becomes hot not that much hot but still a premium laptop Ideapad 5 series should not have this kind of issues. During benchmark test the keyboard area becomes serious hot and the screen area the right bottom area becomes hot due to vent throwing air at the screen.",NEGATIVE
"1. Yes, MS Office is lifetime free with this 2. Yes the battery lasts for quite a few hours 3.

Laptop cannot heat up if you select ""balanced"" in Lenovo Vantage computer management instead of Rapid Charge 7. Yes, you get two years Warranty if you activate your laptop online at Lenovo website 8. This is Windows 11 Operating System and there are Many new features in Windows 11, so explore the Tips and everything will work perfectly 9. McAfee anti-virus offers a heavy discount for the first year and it is a good bargain to install it at least for the first year. 10. Front speakers with Dolby sound is great to listen to 11.

Note - Warranty start date issue is fixed now, great and instant support from HP team for verification and modification in warranty date!  Cons observed so far - 1. No heating in general but slightly gets heat due to 100w charger while charging us connected 2. Sound is average - works better on flat surface and not much good on bed or table 3. Battery backup can be better - Due to H series it is lower as expected but can be improved in this range!  Will update the review in future if any changes!",NEGATIVE

"Battery lasted longer then my first relationship(2 days). Listening to arijit singh songs on full volume since then still isn't getting over. Has more warmth then her. Unlike her there's two way communication here as touchpad is very responsive. Fingerprint lock is nice as it only opens up to me. 5 stars for this, 1 for Shamiya",POSITIVE

Performance is excellent,POSITIVE
"Laptop has battery issue. Also it is not working, OS is not loading. Worst service from the UsedYetNew. They don't call you for service also they do not have service centre.

Very good product and is very comfortable. Good battery life and value for money .sound quality is really impressive and display colors are brilliant,POSITIVE
"Overall this js good buy for me at 28k only.  Pros - latest processor, good configuration, Trusted brand, good screen resolution, latest generation ram, good battery backup, best offer at GIS sale, good offer with McAfee anti-virus and office student lifetime. , sturdy build quality, military grade design. No heating issue, weight is moderate, good to handle, processor performance is not sooo high but better than rizen3 5 th Gen and intell i3 1215  Cons - this laptop normal price could have been lower than 39K which is a usual price, also this brand service center is not well governed by the company. Could be better in all means.  Overall a good product if below 35K. Value for money, best suited for student not having heavy coding stuff to do or gaming aspiration.",POSITIVE

"Performance, Value for Money",POSITIVE
Great and power full laptop in Budget. I received this laptop at 29400k . Intel I3 13 th Gen with 8GB Ram and 512GB ssd Usually laptop price range is 38k but received at 29k best price in Great Indian Sale .  Package was worest from Amazon delivery person was not caring about it .. box was broken and sticker on the package was opened .. anyways inside package from ASUS was proper .. but just telling for your information .,NEGATIVE
"Every detail mentioned about this laptop is justified... i was worried coz of backlit keys but happy it has backlit.... great deal on sale... Laptop is not that heavy... screen is warm(blue light filter) but is good... hinge is good, seems fast, has McAfee 1 yr although not mentioned... office 21 👍.. Thanks amazon",POSITIVE
"Screen colour is yellow, you can't able to view continuously on system, you will not get your money back. Even you won't able to the see screen atleast 2 min also.you will not able to use the laptop. You just keep laptop in box without using.",NEGATIVE
"I made a big jump from a 7th Gen CPU to 13th Gen. Intel i3-1315U is actually comparable to i5-1135G7. So now you can imagine what kind of performance you should be expecting from this processor. This also supports Gen 4 NVMe SSD and RAM upto 24GB, hence, you can get it a significant boost in the later stages of the laptop.",POSITIVE
"Every thing is fine Like:(note: I am giving this review after using it for a week) 1. Weight approx it's 1.66 kg 2.laptop quality is good bottom part is plastic but need to increase more quality 3. Storage:1tb of mine so good read/write speed 4. Battery backup : 3-4hrs in normal use and if it is kept in battery saver and brightness at below 50% it lasts for 5-6 hrs and turning off backlit keyboard. But 41whr battery is not that much good. 5.Processor: core ultra 125h is a good one which contains 14 cores. It's good at multitasking,video editing, and gaming too it supports ray tracing which is good. 6. Over all if you are a student and intrested in editing, coding and light gaming this is a good one.",POSITIVE
Delivered used laptop product and rejected the return or replacement too. Laptop registered in HP in the month of May 2024 and has only warranty upto June 2025. But purchase done in January 2025,NEGATIVE

I just use my laptop for ppt and browsing purpose only.Within 1 year of purchasing I got literally 3 issues with the laptop and customer care service is pathetic both online/offline hp service agency..Please don't take this product...it is a bogus product The issue is system getting blacked out/hanging even if u use for 10minutes and those guys in the previous complaint had done nothing..they just came to my home and rubbed the ram/driver with an eraser(I SAW THAT) and the issue again started after a month and CUSTOMER CARE WILL LITERALLY PLAY WITH YOU FOR 10-15 DAYS and at last I went to an offline authorised hp(only) service store and they told that software is the issue and a new os had been installed and issue still persists and later they told it's a hardware problem(they said that THEY ARE THINKING BUT NOT SURE(SERIOUSLY!!!) and they told that they will replace the mother board which they will get after 10-12 days by order and if the issue still persists after replacing mother board THEY WILL SEE(STILL)!!! I'm done with hp and it's customer care and To any customers/people who have even a minor thought of going with hp product.. PLEASE DONT GO..OTHERWISE YOU WILL SUFFER,NEGATIVE

Great laptop…as expected from HP,POSITIVE

"ince the moment I bought it, the laptop has never worked properly. I’ve had three different engineers come to repair it, but each time, the issue remains unresolved. It seems like no matter how many times they try, nothing gets fixed. This ongoing problem has caused significant frustration, and the worst part is that I am losing valuable work hours and salary because I can't rely on this laptop to function properly. I expected much better quality and service from HP, and this experience has been nothing but a letdown. I would not recommend this product to anyone based on my experience.",NEGATIVE
"Quality wise good. Easy to use, but keyboard is little bit problematic to search as keys are same colour. Sound quality and video quality is good. Starts very early. But expected more battery life, I am not happy with battery life.",NEGATIVE
"It's almost a year since I bought the laptop. It's alright I guess. Bought it for 52,000 INR for which I could have got a laptop with better specs. It's pricey for a 11gen i5 G7 processor and an iGPU. We can get a H or HS processor with a atleast 4GB Vram like 2050 which is better than having a iGPU for the same or even lesser price. On top of that the display ain't even a IPS let alone an OLED it's a normal LCD display with a bad viewing angle. The battery is alright. The build quality is not so good, it bends easily.  TL;DR -Pricey for the specs -mid processor with an iGPU -LCD display with a low viewing angle -mid frame quality -Not worth it for the price",NEGATIVE
HP laptop good performance and design battery life average.,POSITIVE
"I bohhgf this laptop 10 months ago. After 8 months system sound not working.when I raise complaint in online they were unable to fix the software issue. Advised me to go to service center. There they fixed the issue and return the laptop without telling the reason for issue. Also laptop body is not fixed properly. Now, again am facing issue of keyboard stuck and blank screen . I raised complaint again and sent me to service center. This time service center guy said motherboard damaged. Amazon selling defect products. I bought Lenovo laptop 13 years ago till last month it worked . This hp laptop with in 8 months 2 times repair . I requested for replacement. If your not replacing this I will stop online purchase from Amazon and will complain in consumer court.",NEGATIVE
Hp is always a good product,POSITIVE
"The outer shell had a visible scratch, besides that no performance issues. I would like to highlight that the actual price mentioned of 99K is INCORRECT.. that should be true and not a bait",NEGATIVE
Battery life is v poor,NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased this laptop that caught my eye with its sleek design and lightweight build. The camera serves its purpose, but it's the advertised specifications and the backlit keyboard that left me disappointed.  The laptop, as per the Amazon listing, was expected to have a powerful 4.4 GHz processor. However, the laptop I received only features a 2.5 GHz processor, which is a significant letdown.  Additionally, the backlit keyboard, while a nice touch, doesn't perform well in practice. When the backlight is activated, it's difficult to see the keys clearly. This can be frustrating when working in dimly lit environments.  In summary, this laptop is visually appealing and suitable for everyday tasks, but the substantial difference in processor speed and the subpar backlit keyboard are major drawbacks. If you don't need high processing power or rely on a well-functioning backlit keyboard, this laptop may be acceptable. However, if you were expecting the performance specified in the listing, you might want to explore other options.",NEGATIVE
"Pro - light weight - Good display ( Matt finished ) , Really good for reading and coding - Practical keyboard style - Good performance, no lagg so far.  Cons: - very poor sond quality - average battery backup - Plastic quality ( this price tag it is good) durable",POSITIVE
Don't buy this type b**** product .The Customer service not provided side of chuwi and amezon . The microphone and speakers not working. Totally waste of money,NEGATIVE

"Good display, plastic hinges, battery serviceable (3-4 hours) but replacements near impossible since no parts are available in India, Chuwiindia is a fake company, they import from chuwi and simply sell it; chuwiindia doesn't exist its a shell company, they have no service center - all the places listed are generic computer shops.  Cpu overheats - have to limit cpu so that the heat doesn't melt the plastics, I would guess this laptop has a very high chance of catastrophically failing any day within the first year of purchase - so only consider buying if you are okay with losing the money just as fast -  Also it is generally known that chuwi puts cheap laptop batteries in their laptops - so if you use it as your main computer plugged in all the time; your laptop will have a very high chance of swollen batteries very fast.  The display is the redeeming feature of this laptop. Again, buy only if you are willing to not be sad if your laptop does fail, you will get close to no service. You cannot buy parts from aliexpress, chuwiindia doesn't respond to emails or anything, its a fake company.  Take your risks, suggested for people who want a 3rd or 4th spare laptop.",NEGATIVE

"Updated 2022/08/30: Checked with support, I was told that the M.2 slot 0 is both NVMe and SATA and the M.2 slot 1 is only SATA. I took a disk copy from the original M.2 slot STAT drive to a new NVMe drive. It would not recognize the drive and BIOS show no NVMe device. While the NVMe boots up in my Dell Precision 7510 no problem. Took a star away, I wish I could have got it working but it just seemed that the PCIe could not read the drive nor can it be set as a boot device (if it can't see it, it can't boot).  Updated 2022/08/27: I was unable to active the Windows 11 (just want to clarify the issue of the Windows unable to activate, the per-build product code depends on the country that you are in to activate. If you were shipped an pre-build image that is not in your country then it would not activate. Just contact support with the invoice, serial number and country, they will send you a valid activation key for your country.), contacted support, they responded within 24 hours and resolved the issue in 48 hours, consider that they are in China, it is very fast. Much faster than some of the US companies that I contacted in the last 6 months. It is not the fastest laptop, it is a great value for travel or girls who does not play 3D games.  The good: laptop is beautiful good qualify for what you pay. Screen is very nice while everyone had gone to the wide screen, it retained the more traditional screen ratio. The scree is pretty, no doubt. The bad: it is actually decent speed but very slow when running Windows Update. Biggest Problem: I cannot activate the Windows 11 Home that it was preinstalled. I have just contact the support and let's see if they can correct the issue. I am not going to spend another $130 for something that should be included. Stay Tuned... Resolved.",NEGATIVE
"* material and finish is a premium class like 1+ lakh laptop(Samsung galaxy book 4)  * very light weight around 1.4 kg.  * the type-C is a thunderbolt which can be used in display output and data transfer and all USB accessories  * the display quality of this laptop is out of the box. nice colors and also nice viewing angels and brightness is decent but because of the anti reflective coting it's a nice bright in outdoor also.  * keyboard is fantastic I'd say.  * trackpad's quality is nice but the size is decent not too small.  * PERFORMANCE: the CPU performance of this laptop is again out of the box Cinebench r23 scores around 1518 in single core and 7080 in multi core which is almost same as apple m1 cinebench 2024 scores around 96 in single core and 480 in multi core which is almost same as apple m1 geekbench 6 scores around 2240 in single core and 9230 in multi core which is ahead to apple m1  * GPU: it's average not for gaming and 4k editing, but you can do 1080p editing easily without any issues. video rendering test: 4k 1 minute video took 1 minute and 1-8 frame per second which lower than apple m1 which gives you 5-13 frames per second And in 1080p you will find 70-100 frames per second.  * RAM management of this laptop is crazy. you'll never find any issue with it. multitasking (100 chrome tabs, 5 any heavy software and video conference) test: these all runes fast and non stoppable.  * storage is enough.  * you can connect two earbuds at the same time. and honor application and features  * Thermals controls is very good in normal usage no heating problem and in heavy usage you'll find normal temperature increasement.  * fan noise in light usage isn't even hearable and in heavy usage slightly noise.  * audio is louder but the quality is average( around better than 95% windows laptop)  * microphone quality is decent.  * webcam test is good.  * battery life is not that good, you'll get around 3-4 hours of battery life in light usage at 30% brightness.  * charging speed is good.  * ahh. let's talk about the conclusion. so....... even if you're getting this laptop at price of 49k this is the world leading deal. there is a not any laptop which provide this kind of specs at this price.  you can get Lenovo laptop at this price with same processor but the display and speaker quality will be worst than ever.",POSITIVE
"There's no ms office inbuilt. 42 Wh battery last upto 5 hours continuously battery life , no fingerprint sensor, better in fan to reduce heat level, awesome build quality, it's really value for money , good looking",POSITIVE
"1) there is no backlit keyboard 2) There is no dedicated enter key in numerical keyboard side. 3) there is no fingerprint sensor 4) There is no dedicated print screen key.  Also, I went to upgrade and add extra storage, the computer centre told me that this model doesn't have an extra slot to increase its hard disk memory; only the original SSD can be replaced with an increased memory size, and the old one needs to be removed for that. Also, RAM is fixed at 16 GB and can't be increased. This laptop also has very limited connecting ports.  Battery time: Now after use of 6 months, the battery finishes within half an hour.  So product not recommended, buy Dell or Asus or other good products which can be upgraded to higher storage, have dedicated buttons and more battery power.",NEGATIVE
"I recently had the pleasure of using this product, and I’m thoroughly impressed with both its performance and build quality. The device operates smoothly and efficiently, handling tasks with speed and ease. Whether it's multitasking or running more demanding applications, it performs without any noticeable lag or stuttering.  The build quality is equally exceptional. It feels solid and durable in hand, with attention to detail evident in its design. The materials used are premium, giving it a sleek, polished finish that also feels sturdy enough to withstand daily use. Overall, it’s clear that a lot of thought and care went into the construction, ensuring that this product not only performs at a high level but also stands the test of time.  For anyone looking for a reliable, well-made product that delivers great performance, this is definitely a top contender. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE

"After using Vivobook16 for a week, I was generally satisfied with its performance and features. The 16-inch FHD display is great to look at and satisfactory for video viewing, browsing, and working. The laptop's slim and stylish design makes it easy to carry around. With 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD, it gives speedy performance, and I haven't experienced any lag or issues with multitasking. The chiclet keyboard is comfortable to type on, although the lack of a backlight may disappoint users who prefer typing in low-light environments. The camera with a privacy shutter and fingerprint scanner adds a layer of security, which is a plus. The laptop has numerous ports, and charging is reasonably fast. One major drawback is the sound quality; the loudspeakers sound cheap and echoey, like sound coming from an empty pot. Even with average earphones attached, the sound quality doesn't improve much. However, the VivoBook 16 is valuable for the price, with good performance, display, and overall features. While poor sound and no keyboard backlighting almost outweigh the positives, this laptop is a good option if you're looking for a reliable machine for work or average use. Just be prepared to use earphones or external speakers for better audio quality and get used to typing without a keyboard backlight.",POSITIVE
"I purchased asus vivobook 16 i3 12th generation Laptop at amezon. This laptop not started after 3 hours charging.

In this laptop a little bit heating issue but I adjust because I m purchased this for my college and my ssc coaching giving mock and online classes....  If you are student so go for it and 25k is a very good budget I think this amount is never come back or offers",NEGATIVE
I have recently bought the Asus Vivobook 16 and I must say it's a very good budget laptop for daily basic usage and especially for a student like me. It's Intel i3 1215u processor handles basic tasks like PPT presentation Excel and net surfing very easily. It also has a decent display of 16 inches to watch movies and videos on. It also offers a fingerprint scanner which is a very good thing in a budget laptop. One thing which I think is missing is the backlit keyboard at this price point otherwise the laptop is very nice and I would recommend you to buy it for daily usage and basic gaming ( Not heavy games like pubg gta v etc),POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this laptop for my sister as she started her college journey, and it has proven to be a great choice!  For its price, this laptop delivers solid performance. It handles everyday tasks like note-taking, browsing, and streaming lectures smoothly. While it may not be a powerhouse for heavy gaming or complex design software, it’s more than sufficient for a typical college student’s needs.  The laptop is lightweight and easy to carry, which is a big plus for a student constantly on the move between classes. The sleek design adds a professional touch, and it looks more expensive than it actually is.  The battery life is commendable—lasting long enough to get through a full day of classes without needing a charge, depending on usage.  Overall, this laptop is a fantastic student-friendly option that balances performance and affordability. If you're looking for a dependable device for college, this is a great pick!",POSITIVE
Works as advertised! The included MS office was the clincher. Using for two weeks now! Cannot complain!,POSITIVE

"I recently purchased the Dell G15 5520 Gaming Laptop, and I must say, it is an absolute powerhouse. Equipped with an Intel i5-12500H processor, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and a 512GB SSD, this laptop delivers an ultimate gaming experience. The NVIDIA RTX 3050 (4GB GDDR6) graphics card ensures smooth and immersive gameplay, making every session a visual treat.  The 15.6"" FHD WVA AG 120Hz display with 250 nits of brightness provides superb screen quality, perfect for both gaming and multimedia consumption. The vibrant colors and sharp details enhance the overall visual experience. The backlit keyboard with an orange hue adds a stylish touch, making it a pleasure to use even in low-light conditions.  Despite its many strengths, the laptop does have one notable drawback—the battery life. Given its substantial weight and heavy-duty battery, I expected it to last at least three hours on a single charge. However, I was disappointed to find that the battery life only allows for about half an hour of gaming. This short battery life can be a significant inconvenience, especially for gamers who enjoy long sessions without being tethered to a power outlet.  Aside from the battery issue, my experience with the Dell G15 5520 has been excellent. The laptop's performance, screen quality, and overall build make it a fantastic choice for gamers and power users alike. The combination of Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 2021 adds to its appeal, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.

LOOKS are soo Nice ..Every thing is just Best in class Quality of Body is super sturdy Sound quality is Very nice Gaming You can do run any game smoothly Just Battery backup is not that good and thats not the problem because every gaming laptop will have poor backup ..but its ok on battery saver for normal tasks 2 to 3 hours max Performance is top notch,POSITIVE
"Writing this review after 1.5 years of use,  Pros:  Good-looking laptop for a fair price. Aesthetic design, similar to Dell Alienware. No fingerprint magnet; matt finish body is easy to clean. 3050 Nvidia Graphics card, capable of playing most modern games with medium graphics settings.  Cons:  Battery life is extremely short: 30 minutes on normal use and 10 minutes on gaming. This is the most significant drawback of this system. The machine became slow after one year of use, even with the same software setup. Avoid this laptop. Even a new battery will not significantly improve its performance",NEGATIVE
"Best laptop under this price range there is no issue, I got a laptop on the evening of October 4, 2024, with 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD, in a cool silver color. It's the best laptop from ASUS, and I used it until 2 AM. The battery backup lasted up to 6 hours. The processor is fast and performs very smoothly for video editing. You can buy this at a great price, and I got it for ₹54,000 after an SBI credit card discount.",POSITIVE
Sound quality is good.. Performance is good... Overall its good.  Small display bleeding issue.... Only on black screen. But it can cause zero damage... Small heating issue.. But its not a problem. Don't expect high battery life..,POSITIVE
"Update 21 jan 2025. Broken back cover due to hinge. No action taken by Amazon. So I start using at my home lightly , and 1.5 month did not used as I was out side city.  Internal Back cover screw place damaged due to hinge tighteness , kind of manufacturing defect , visited service centre told me 3000-4000 cost , now see under warranty product condition , it’s quite weak laptop, avoid to buy , thnx  Review after purchase(old) I purchased an ASUS laptop on October 18, 2024, through Amazon. Just 2-3 days after receiving it, I noticed an excessive heating issue, which prompted me to reach out to Amazon customer care for a return. However, instead of processing the return directly, they suggested that I visit an ASUS service center. Following their advice, I visited the service center, where I received a DOA (Dead on Arrival) approval. ASUS packaged the laptop using their special packing material and instructed me not to tamper with it.  On November 1, Amazon scheduled a pickup, but it was rejected because the ASUS-approved packaging could not be opened for inspection. This led to a series of rescheduled pickups, all of which failed due to the same issue.  It’s been a never-ending cycle of rescheduling, calling Amazon multiple times (over 10 calls by now), and dealing with service complications. As a programmer who depends heavily on a functional laptop for work, being left without one has caused immense disruption and wasted valuable time. Both Amazon and ASUS have shown poor coordination and service, making the return process unnecessarily frustrating. If you’re considering buying electronics online, think twice — this experience has made me question the convenience of online purchases compared to buying from a physical store. I cant say anything about the seller. but issue in amazon pickup policy how they do.",NEGATIVE
Edit: previously had Screen Bleeding issue. Got it repaired within a week from Asus. Now works like a charm. Great laptop for gaming & office use.,POSITIVE
"Yo, ASUS really outdid themselves with this laptop. It's a total beast and can handle any game you throw at it. The display is also amazing, especially after I calibrated it using the MyASUS app. And the speakers sound incredible after I activated the Dirac inbuilt sound enhancement software.  It does get a bit warm during gaming sessions, but you can adjust the fan speed in the MyASUS app and use NVIDIA GeForce Experience with Whisper Mode to reduce the fan noise.",POSITIVE
"The professionalism of the Amazon supply chain is completely gone, and false information is being fed into the portal. I have to struggle to get the products, and the delivery person charged extra money to pick up my buyback laptop. I have also provided written communication to Amazon and the portal, but there has been no response. However, the product I received is good due to its configuration",NEGATIVE
"I bought the laptop on 19 th Jan and it's packaging is sp good...... The laptop performance is great 💯👍 I'm satisfied with this configuration But the battery is average and it's sound quality is average you have to use headset or airdrop with it...... It cost me around 55000 Rs, So in this budget it's value for money I guess 👍",NEGATIVE
it is good product. it does have a bit of noise in fan . Rest is good. Not very good for heavy gaming. Because it has 55 tgp gpu. It has very good performance for task i have done till now. Heat level did not increased much because i did not do any heavy work or used it for longer session. Right now it has proper build not defect its track pad does not work,NEGATIVE
I was very careful while choosing laptop in this price segment because the only option I have is Intel's i3 or ryzen's 3 that too u series but then I got this offer at 37K only ryzen 5 + 7000 series although we have less cores with this chipset but it has a decent performance for this price.,POSITIVE
"Laptop build & quality is very good,,,  Delivery was also fast and in good condition, thanks Team Amazon.",POSITIVE
Product quality is awesome in this price range. Performance and usability is unbeatable.,POSITIVE
Average product.. Average CPU.. Just 4 cores a d 8 threads. You should get atleast a Hexa core at this price. Expected a atleast an IPS display t this rate.. This is not ideal for any kind of media consumption or games. So the complimentary game pass seems useless.  Concerned to install any major apps on this.  Build quality and size is good. And design is attractive.  Overall the laptop is only good for some normal MS office work... I'm sure it will slow down significantly over time.,NEGATIVE
"Laptop is nice and decent performance for this price range. However, the charger is big 3pin type heavy and bulky. The charger could have been small and light weight.",NEGATIVE
Display is not good not recommended for students,NEGATIVE
"People might say it’s zen 2 processor and not as fast but it is the latest processor with 4 core 8 threads and all are performance cores. And all the things In the laptop are latest like WiFi 6e, ddr5 ram with 5500 mhz. This is a very good professional laptop for students as well as professionals with good battery backup and great performance . Also the 14 inch form factor is perfect to carry and since it has military certification it will last long . Over all this asus vivobook go 14 ryzen 5 7520u is best laptop under 40k . Go for it without doubt you will not regret it",POSITIVE
Battery was not even charging charger was over heating with only my product I think they accidently sent me a refurbished laptop,NEGATIVE
"All features available you can buy it useful for kids and adults at home , office, games, content writer",POSITIVE
"Good: 1. Great specs for budget - Good processor, 2. Decent battery life around 4-5 hrs on office work 3. Can upgrade Ram and SSD 4. Comes with LTF MS office and Windows 5. Screen quality is good  Bad: 1. Keyboard is not good. You can literally push the keyboard assembly down 2. Camera does not have shutter 3. No type C charging through type c port provided. 4. You only get 1 year warranty. On retail or on website you can get 3 yrs extended warranty  Got this laptop as it came with very good exchange offer for my previous laptop. If you budget is around 33-36k (excluding exchange) , go for this laptop.",NEGATIVE
I have not experienced any problem so far. The quality of the laptop is excellent. Wish it had a USB C type charging port.,POSITIVE
Keyboard quality was waste and make noice when fan run price also dropped,NEGATIVE
Worth it for its price,POSITIVE
"For this price range, laptop is working smooth for now. Major lacking is the camera privacy shutter. I am also facing Bluetooth connection. It gets disconnected and doesn't get connected again, shows error.",NEGATIVE
I was in a that this laptop has backlight keyboard but unfortunately it is not there ... When asked Amazon and Acer support they informed that this product has not backlight keyboard. Also there are 3 variants which has same configuration but with and without backlight keyboard. So it's unfortunate to me but please check before buying.,NEGATIVE
Wish almighty should give more and more power to you to work for us thankyou very much for working for us 🙏🙏🙏,POSITIVE
Pathetic! Product came with no MS office as was promised … Amazon customer service asked me to place a fresh order and request a return for this. While fresh laptop was delivered but this one has still not been picked up and it’s been a month !! Amazon pick up people don’t turn up and then put in their system that pick up was denied by customer !! It’s a scam ! Called Amazon custom service multiple times and they just put a fresh pick up request and assure it will be done.. but same story repeated multiple times!! I am stuck with a bad product and waste of 38k for over a month!! Pathetic customer service by Amazon,NEGATIVE
Excellent 👌 product as per website description the configuration is oky ultimate product of Lenovo,POSITIVE
"Everything is good, except display quality, at this price range it is fine too",POSITIVE
"Battery Back up is really a concern, it drains very quickly...",NEGATIVE
I bought it in October and in less than 2 months the laptop stopped working. It's not switching on. After 1 hour of struggle with Lenovo customer care they diagnosed that the mother board has conked off. This is with a bare 2-3 hours usage a day. Don't buy this laptop!,NEGATIVE

Lenovo is better than this in this price range . Thank u very much ok bye ok ok ok ok,POSITIVE
"1.) Performance in ultra 5 125 is great in overall because of Intel evo certification 2.) Gpu far better than any other integrated gpu acr but not as dedicated easily getting 120+ fps in Valorant (medium settings) 30 fps in RRD2 (medium settings) 60 fps in GTA5 (High settings) 3.) Battery life in balance is last 5 to 6 hours in normal works (not as expected. but alright for H series processor 4.) Value of money for around 70k to 75k 5.) Speed is good, have lpddrx 5 ,120hz 6.) there are some software bugs (very. minor) hope it will be fix 7.) Sound is decent when you put laptop in plane surface, not in laptop or bed , as it speaker in down firing 8.) Camera is Best in comparison of today's other laptop camera 9.) Display is good, easily better than normal IPS (100% SRGB) , using it for video editing and media consuming 10.) Build is easily one of the best as expected from pavilion plus series Large trackpad good keyboard. experience",POSITIVE
Never buy hp!! Buy LENOVO with same specs at 20k cheaper price. Many display issues!! Just after 6 months red dot/dead pixel appeared and the hp service Center says can’t claim under warranty until 5 red dots appear!! What a pathetic excuse!! Looks like they already know these are defective products hence designed This kind of policies. Made in china effect 👎🏻,NEGATIVE
"Great display with bright colours, very fast and efficient processor, light weight, impressive camera, 100w type c charger, Intel Evo certified, Ms office lifetime, new blue colour than usual silver in market - overall a great beast from HP Pavilion Plus series laptop as I got it under 70k during sale so value for money deal for me as well!  Note - Warranty start date issue is fixed now, great and instant support from HP team for verification and modification in warranty date!  Cons observed so far - 1. No heating in general but slightly gets heat due to 100w charger while charging us connected 2. Sound is average - works better on flat surface and not much good on bed or table 3. Battery backup can be better - Due to H series it is lower as expected but can be improved in this range!  Will update the review in future if any changes!",NEGATIVE
"1. Solid Laptop with great battery backup, I only use it for study and for basic task in excel and docs and it easily last for 9hrs plus. 2. Nice Web cam although struggles when room is not properly light up. 3. Boot time is 14.5 sec when fast boot mode is on by default and I turned off fast boot it takes around 28secs to boot up. 4. SSD read and write speed is 3600MB/Sec and 2400MB/Ssec. 5. Keyboard is good and as power button is in keyboard, when you accidentally press it while typing it doesn't off the screen. 6. Screen is 8bit 100%sRGB and NO HDR support on YouTube. 7. Trackpad is large enough.",NEGATIVE
"There is noticeable screen bleeding issue from the moment of opening it from box and booting it up. Ordered the laptop on 12th Aug as a prime user, received on 18th Aug and I talked to hp customer support. More than the hardware issue the hp customer support is probably the worst of all brands. For the first 4 days the haven't bothered to register a case id. After registering case id they told service technician will visit for inspection. I provided all the necessary proofs and delivery video but technician told he elevated the issue and I will receive resolution within 48 hrs. It's been 120 hrs (5 days ) no resolution or call or any mail from hp customer support and none are even bothering to repair or replace the product. Now I will be forced to request refund due to sub-standard product with hardware issue. Hp has the most pathetic customer support out of all.",NEGATIVE

I am really worried that after specing Rs 81000 amazon is treating their customer like this way. The CS lasy told me that she cnat do anythign she is just doing a job?",NEGATIVE

One of the best laptop I had ever seen..Most useful for everything and most trustworthy laptop for everyone who is of latest tech generation,POSITIVE
"The product's features for the price it's offered is very competitive. It works smoothly, has all you need for office and student work (windows 11 pro and ms office 2021).  The seller was also helpful and promptly helped me via anydesk when I couldn't access ms office which actually was a mistake from my end. Also, lenovo helped me get warranty months back due to some glitch as it showed 8 months left but they fixed it after asking me for invoice and pslip.  Display could have been better brightness wise but no issues when using indoors on near full brightness.  Total 9.5/10",POSITIVE
Speed and quality is good. Sound is clear. It has 8gb soldered memory. Not expandable at all.,POSITIVE
Worst Battery Performance less than 5 hours but it's advertisement showed more than 8 Hours.,NEGATIVE
Very Good Product Very Fast will update after 3 months,POSITIVE
Over-all laptop is good ... Decent build quality and fairly weight and good performance but since it is basically for students and professionals the battery backup is not satisfying... Battery not last for more than 2 hour,NEGATIVE
Laptop is overall good but sound quality is not good very low sound,NEGATIVE

"After 2 weeks of purchase iam writing this review Battery backup is good, performance is also good no lags,but sometimes fingerprint sensor is not capturing.with 65w charger around one and half an hour it is full charged.spekaers also good but not loud.",POSITIVE
"I had been using this more than a month now for Full Stack development, I cant be more happy than this, got the beast only for 80k, Its too cheap to get i9 13th gen in this budget, first i thought Its having some problem, but since day 1 perfomance had been top notch, I thought there will be heating issue but I havent found it, neither any sound of fan so far. I always use laptop connected to power (which is recomemded) so cant say anything about battery life, but if possible we should always pefer using any laptop connected to power instead of charging and discharging every now and then which reduces battery life. My last Asus i5 lasted 7years daily 9am-911pm lets see with this i9, fingers crossed.",NEGATIVE
"The display quality is poor. Don't buy it. Prioritise display over processor. Anyway, most of the time you won't be able to utilise the i9 processor fully.",NEGATIVE
Very nice product,POSITIVE
I you want to purchase the pc for multitasking then it is the best choice. It performs heavy-to-heavy tasks with out any problem. Getting i9 processor at this price range makes this the best choice.,POSITIVE

"Hello, i have been using this laptop for 7 days now. It has some good features and some bad ones. This laptop firstly came with an intel core i3 12th gen processor which has a quite good reputation. This computer is very butter smooth multitasking laptop. It has 8GB of Ram which makes the laptop capable to run multiple apps and chrome tab without any hassle, it doesn't take much time to open chrome. This computer aslo has a NVMe 512GB SSD, i love how they added this SSD to make the laptop faster, the boot time of this laptop is less than 9 seconds (depending on how may applications are installed). It is a very fast SSD in your budget (i think). The battery backup is kinda good, it keeps your laptop on the go for almost 10 hours without its charger (depending on what you are doing on the laptop). This laptop is equipped with Intel UHD 780 graphics with 4GB VRAM which makes the laptop capable of mid video editing and photo editing without hassle. Asking about gaming, I played Tom Clancy's The Divisions, GTA V on this, i got almost smooth 60fps on 720p lowest settings. Since i told the good side of it. Here are some drawbacks of this laptop. This laptop have poor sound quality like the volume is too low for me i think. That's all...",NEGATIVE
"I received a faulty laptop from Amazon, and upon opening it one month after purchase, I discovered that its Windows operating system was corrupted. For the past three weeks, the responses I have received regarding this issue have been unsatisfactory. I genuinely regret my decision to purchase this laptop.",NEGATIVE
Excellent,POSITIVE
Core i3 suitable for moderate use. Good build and enough connectors on either side. Very cost competitive.,POSITIVE
Received the laptop yesterday only. The Display type is not mentioned any where in the products specification page in amazon. Its an TFT display with narrow viewing angles. however the display looks crisp when looking from front. Sound volume is very low cannot be used for video conferencing or attending class if there is ambient noise around. Otherwise the laptop feels preppy and fast. On the software side the laptop lacks MS office license which have to be purchase separately. Better to go for laptops that come with MSO.,NEGATIVE
It's good product but there is no keyboard light it's causing problems when need to work on night.... please check all the details before buying thanks,NEGATIVE
Low budget high performance nice display smoothness to use,POSITIVE
"Perfect buld, light weight and perfect config.",POSITIVE
1. Good laptop within a budget. 2. Delivery is very late 3. Original seal is broken and pasted another on that. 4. There is no heat issue 5. Battery Performance is good. 6.

Received my laptop after 7-8 days. Screen has manufacturing defect. Very whitish and blurry appearance is showing. After adjusting the settings still fault persist. Blackish shadow is also showing on screen. From last 2days trying to call Amazon for replacement. But there is no any direct option available on Amazon website. I am requesting all viewer please don't buy from Amazon. You will loose your hard earned money. Product quality and customer service of Amazon is worst. No one will hear your request. Lenovo is the worst company you can deal. Please purchase products from physicaly flipkart Amazon is just a name.,NEGATIVE
"I've been using the Lenovo V15 Ryzen 5 laptop for a few weeks now, and I'm thoroughly impressed. Here's why:  Performance: The Ryzen 5 7520u processor with 8GB DDR5 Ram handles multitasking seamlessly, making it perfect for work, study, or everyday use. Display: The 15.6"" Full HD display is crisp and vibrant, with good color accuracy. Battery Life: I've been getting around 6-7 hours of battery life, which is impressive for a laptop in this price range.  Overall, I'd highly recommend the Lenovo V15 Rzyen 5 laptop to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable device for everyday use.  Pros:  - Excellent performance - Good display quality - Impressive battery life - Affordable price",POSITIVE
"Plus points about this laptop are:- 1)Powerful latest generation i5 (12450H) processor. 2)sleek and professional design. Sturdy build. Comes with a fast 150watt adaptor. 3)Fast gen 4 SSD. 4)Glare free 144hz display. 5)A powerful enough gpu to play games and render videos. 6)LOUD speakers. I didn't expected this. Although bass is a bit less. 7)Nice keyboard with a separate numpad and powerful enough Back light. 8)Latest wifi version 6E is packed in it. 9)Office 2021 is included for lifetime. 10)Comes at a nice price point.  A few cons are:- 1)Upgradability. You won't be able to upgrade ram over 16 Gb and no additional SSD/HDD slot provided. 2)Ports. Even 2021 version has 3 USB A Ports. This one has only 2. 3)Screen wobble is less as compared to 2021 version but is still present. Battery is as much as expected from a gaming laptop.  (*) I have an additional complaint against HP. You can't set a maximum charge limit (like 80% or 90%) at which charging would automatically stop. (Asus, lenovo, acer all provide this feature in some way. Even most smartphones support it.) So why a 65k+ laptop can't support it. HP MUST provide that feature if customers want it.  FINALLY, How good is it against Asus vivobook pro 15 OLED, as both costs somewhat around the same. ->See if you are going to consume alot of movies, web series, videos etc. on your laptop. Buy Asus eyes closed as the difference in display picture quality is same as the difference between day and night. ->If you want a more powerful laptop. Asus stands nowhere against HP Victus. Its a nice and power packed laptop for students(coders and casual gamers). ->If your main purpose is to play latest game titles on your laptop, then buy HP Pavillion (ryzen 5 5600h, rtx 3050, better 72%ntsc display).",NEGATIVE
Laptop looks wise is awesome but battery could have been better drains fastly and screen whopping while opening the lid and laptop material is ok not that much robust but overall performance wise it's good and display is awesome one can buy since it's in budget,POSITIVE
"I got this laptop for 48600 rs , at this price , this is a very good gaming performance laptop , this is a entry level gaming laptop with RTX 2050 , I tried it with GTA 5 , with highest settings at 1080×1920 resolution supported by laptop, i got 60-65 fps , which is good for me, biggest issue is battery backup, which is very low, At this price point this is overall a good deal for me",POSITIVE
"I was so looking forward to receiving my laptop.... firstly the delivery date was 10 days after the order date...secondly the laptop arrived in a damaged amazon box with no cushioning at all inside. As soon as i picked up the amazon box i could feel the laptop rattling around inside....still i took the delivery and opened the laptop and as expected there was screen damage, probably from such bad shipping...the laptop had a blue line on the screen as ive shown in the picture above.....the laptop itself is a real great product and totally value for money....ive used my friend's Victus and it works like a charm...but im so disappointed with such a big company like amazon that they didnt even bother to properly pack a product that is so expensive....60k is no joke especially for middle class people like us and still if we have to keep returning it again and again hoping we will get a non damaged product this time, then i think amazon should really reconsider their shipping techniques... NO HATE TO THE LAPTOP THOUGH THE LAPTOP IS AMAZING....THE SHIPPING RUINED IT ALL FOR ME",NEGATIVE
Best product op hp victus gaming Laptop,POSITIVE
"Go for it if you getting it under 50k, as it's gaming lapi, can't expect more on battery backup you need to use power during game for better performance. Under this price it's really a good deal.( Performance awasome, picture quality best, size is okay, weight is good for gaming series, OS+Office) logo 'V' looks awesome.  Note- It's my initial feedback after a week use only",POSITIVE
"Victus i5 12-gen 1245H, great laptop for all purpose, specially for coding and running software, it specs is more than enough to run any task smoothly, since it is built for gaming so doing any graphic things like Photoshop is lot more smoother. Display is 144hz and amoled. only downside for coding is screen aspect ratio. Overall great laptop, working as smooth as new after 1yr . One more thing it sucks battery nicely. Hardly last 2.5h of heavy work, 4h movie time",NEGATIVE
Quality is best Battery life in more than enough Best gaming functionality Size is 15 inch Heat level is no issue Enough weight,POSITIVE
"First Impressions: This laptop looks incredibly cute. The laptop is conveniently small and light weight (although, not as light weight as a MacBook or a Chromebook). It turns on in a snap. While setting it up, I observed that it detects Broadband WiFis faster than mobile hotspot. The Windows 11 Home and the MS Office 2021 come pre-activated. You may observe some initial distortion in the image color but that gets automatically resolved once the system updates with the relevant drivers.  Performance wise, it is a budget laptop so don't expect mind numbing performance compared to the high end models, but this is a workhorse and it will take you there. If you are purchasing this, go for the 16GB version and ensure that you install the Lenovo Vantage software as it would activate some of the more useful features. Do expect the usual fan noise and heat when the laptop is doing some heavy lifting, however, if you want to use it for consuming media and some light school/office work, it will barely make a sound.  The battery pack boasts 6-7 hours of support, but if you are pushing for performance, the batteries drain fast (shy of 2-3 hours). It comes with a 65W charger and it claims to support intelligent and rapid charging ( through the Vantage app). As I keep the charger connected at all times, the first feature claims to help the batteries last longer. I haven't used the second feature yet as it is mentioned that rapid charging works only when the laptop is shut down or hibernating. As I haven't turned on the second feature, I can't comment on whether it works.  Additionally, I found out that I could charge it through the USB-C port as well, however, I did get several alerts to use the in-box charger for better reliability. I have tried charging it with a 65W smartphone charger for smaller time periods and bottomline, it works but not as fast as the dedicated one.  The 14 inch Display supports 60Hz refresh rate by default and it cannot be changed. The size is adequate for most office work as that's what I do mostly. If you need an additional screen, you can connect a second monitor through HDMI. The colors are vivid and I'm yet to test the full gamut of colors it can support. The GPU is in-built and has 8GB of storage. You can run some light games on this, but all the good games are off-limits! While playing videos on YouTube, it shows display options upto 4K, so feel free to test it if and when you purchase it.  The speakers are median. Not loud (I like it), but if you are a bass head, feel free to buy a speaker or connect it through the bluetooth. After the recent update, I can see Dolby surround support, but I couldn't discern any changes.  The keyboard feels sturdy. The keys are tactile and make minimal noise while in use. A note of caution though, the product image may mislead you into thinking that this laptop has a backlit keyboard, but it doesn't have one.  The laptop body is polycarbonate (fancy word for plastic) with grills on the bottom, under the screen and under the Intel and the Lenovo logos, so it's quite ventilated and if you intend to run it in a dusty place, make sure you clean the grills every now and then.  The camera is a basic 720p built in privacy shutter that will give you Aadhar card level video quality, but let's be honest, you bought this because you don't have a lot of money to buy a MacBook, so no complaints here!  Coming to connectivity, it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity), on the case of ports, you get 1-HDMI (not sure if has Arc support), 1-USB C, 2- USB A ports (probably, v3 but I am not sure as all are painted black and I don't have a flash drive lying around to check).

"I read a lot of reviews about this laptop, so I was aware that it would be slow and that there would be a heating problem, which is understandable given its low price. You can't expect it to perform like a laptop that costs 50,000 INR. I did face issues: it is slow, it heats up a little on the left side of the keyboard, the battery backup is not good, and there is problem while watching videos. I bought it because I wanted to use it for browsing and occasionally using MS Office.  After 12 days of usage, I received an update, and when I tried to install it, the laptop wouldn't turn on. I'm lucky that this happened before the expiration of the replacement period.  I would suggest everyone to buy branded laptops, even if they don’t have Windows 11 or powerful processors and RAM. For 12 days, it worked fine, though it wasn’t on par with an i5 or better processors. If I compare it with my 9 years old I5 5th generation laptop then more or less both are same.  Apart from the product another worst thing is the delivery which takes 1 week. Don't be under the assumption that we get Amazon's product before expected date.  I faced the same issue even after getting replacement. This is totally a useless product. If you can use it without updating you can take a risk of buying.",NEGATIVE
"Chuwi laptops offer excellent value for budget-conscious buyers. They feature simple designs, decent displays, and solid battery life, making them ideal for basic tasks like web browsing and word processing. Performance is suitable for light use but struggles with demanding applications. A great choice for casual users on a budget.",POSITIVE
"Loved the built quality of the laptop. The screen is perfect and the packaging is amazing. I would recommend for basic use - Internet, MS office, Emails, youtube etc. Please don't buy if you are a gamer and if you need heavy usage. The camera is great and it's value for money. Battery life is good and the display screen is very well. Sound is nice too. Functionality wise it would perform less than an i3 but it's good.",POSITIVE

"Totally worth the money. Surprisingly good. Anyone who want a laptop just for attending lectures, online coaching, msoffice can buy this blindly. Battery backup is more than 6 hours normal use. If U remove bloatware, reduce animations, U can clock 10hours battery backup. Best in India under 15000, for laptop markets.",NEGATIVE
"I’ve been using this laptop for a few weeks now, and I’m thoroughly impressed with its performance! From the moment I powered it on, everything runs incredibly smooth. The speed is remarkable, whether I’m multitasking with multiple apps, editing large files, or even gaming. The processor handles everything I throw at it without any signs of slowing down.  The display is stunning—sharp and vibrant, which makes working for long hours much easier on the eyes. Battery life is also a pleasant surprise, lasting me through a full day of heavy use without needing to recharge constantly. And the design? Sleek and modern, making it perfect for both work and play.  Overall, if you’re looking for a laptop that delivers in terms of speed, performance, and looks, this is an excellent choice. Definitely worth every penny! Highly recommended.",POSITIVE

If any problem comes. Amazon is worst than any retail shop. The app just keeps going in circle when you try to connect with customer service. From the internet I somehow connected to their customer service. But I felt sorry for them as they don't have any clear instructions. Lenovo gave a DOA and seal packed the laptop. More than three weeks now. I am left with DOA and seal packed laptop. My money is struck and no laptop to use.,NEGATIVE
"After getting white screen innmy iphone 13 pro after 17.5.1 update I wanted to tell bye bye for apple products . So I was searching replacement for my macbook pro since last 3 weeks . After researching a lot this one felt like a good choice in every aspects , display , performance, gaming .  Having core ultra 9 is very good for any task , Intel arc graphics is integrated , but it's equivalent to 4gb graphics of 3050 series and pretty good . 32 gb ram is all enough for anything. First time in my life I never heard fan sound when Android studio running with emulator, which shows how good this laptop is in terms of performance. Played couple of games via game pass I got and they were good , but size of games are like 129 gb and all , that was surprising to me as I played games in laptop after years . But 1 tb SSD is all enough to have such 5 games . Battery life came 7 hours for me for mixed usage . As a security professional running kali linux in virtual box was very smooth and I didn't expect so much good performance for the price . So it's value for money. As by combining offers I got it around 86 k . It have amazing display and brightness, which even beats so called retina displays . Totally satisfied with the choice i made.",POSITIVE
"I wanted a laptop which will last for 3-4 years, The specs will take care of Android Studio and any type of coding for another couple of years. (You don't need this laptop for Web development, just buy lower models like 16GB/512GB intel ultra 5) Display: satisfied with the quality NOT with the brightness though, could have been 600nits. Processor+RAM+Storage: can't get better at this price (95K) range, especially for a Hybrid app developer. Battery: It will last easily for approx 6 hours with 70% Brightness. Webcam: Scam 1080p..? I don't know, camera feels like 720p MacBook webcam. Build quality: Just as good as MacBook with better key travel, amazing trackpad(glass). Speakers: Loud and clear with NO base at all. So, use headphone/Bluetooth speaker this shouldn't be big of a deal. Fan Noise: I can say for windows laptop the noise levels are very low. Consssss: I'm still not able get the output from USB type C (Monitor has 65W output + DP), I tried Multiple times. currently using HDMI to connect a monitor.

"I recently purchased the Dell G15 5520 Gaming Laptop, and I must say, it is an absolute powerhouse. Equipped with an Intel i5-12500H processor, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and a 512GB SSD, this laptop delivers an ultimate gaming experience. The NVIDIA RTX 3050 (4GB GDDR6) graphics card ensures smooth and immersive gameplay, making every session a visual treat.  The 15.6"" FHD WVA AG 120Hz display with 250 nits of brightness provides superb screen quality, perfect for both gaming and multimedia consumption. The vibrant colors and sharp details enhance the overall visual experience. The backlit keyboard with an orange hue adds a stylish touch, making it a pleasure to use even in low-light conditions.  Despite its many strengths, the laptop does have one notable drawback—the battery life. Given its substantial weight and heavy-duty battery, I expected it to last at least three hours on a single charge. However, I was disappointed to find that the battery life only allows for about half an hour of gaming. This short battery life can be a significant inconvenience, especially for gamers who enjoy long sessions without being tethered to a power outlet.  Aside from the battery issue, my experience with the Dell G15 5520 has been excellent. The laptop's performance, screen quality, and overall build make it a fantastic choice for gamers and power users alike. The combination of Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 2021 adds to its appeal, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.  In summary:  Performance: Top-notch gaming performance with Intel i5-12500H, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and NVIDIA RTX 3050.  Display: Superb screen quality with a 15.6"" FHD WVA AG 120Hz display.  Design: Stylish backlit keyboard and robust build quality.  Battery Life: Short battery life, only around 30 minutes of gaming on a single charge.  Overall Experience: Despite the battery issue, an excellent gaming laptop.  Overall, the Dell G15 5520 Gaming Laptop offers a great experience, provided you're prepared to deal with its limited battery life. If you're primarily using it in a stationary setup, this laptop will undoubtedly serve you well.",POSITIVE

"Writing this review after 1.5 years of use,  Pros:  Good-looking laptop for a fair price. Aesthetic design, similar to Dell Alienware. No fingerprint magnet; matt finish body is easy to clean. 3050 Nvidia Graphics card, capable of playing most modern games with medium graphics settings.  Cons:  Battery life is extremely short: 30 minutes on normal use and 10 minutes on gaming. This is the most significant drawback of this system. The machine became slow after one year of use, even with the same software setup. Avoid this laptop. Even a new battery will not significantly improve its performance",NEGATIVE

"The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a budget-friendly, mid-range laptop ideal for daily tasks like web browsing, word processing, and light media consumption. It offers good performance with Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and SSD storage, making it suitable for light multitasking and moderate workloads. The design is sleek and portable, with a solid build and comfortable keyboard. The 14-inch Full HD display is decent for indoor use, though not as vibrant as premium models. The battery lasts 6 to 8 hours on a full charge, depending on usage. It offers a variety of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and Ethernet, plus Wi-Fi 6 for fast connectivity. The audio quality is fine for casual use but lacks depth. Overall, the Inspiron 5440 offers great value for users needing a reliable laptop for everyday tasks, though it’s not suited for intensive gaming or content creation.",POSITIVE

"The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a mid-range laptop that provides solid performance for daily computing tasks, making it a great option for users looking for a reliable, budget-friendly device. Here's a detailed review of its features:  Performance: The Dell Inspiron 5440 typically comes with a range of processors, including Intel Core i5 or Core i7, which offer solid performance for most everyday tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and media consumption. The laptop is also suitable for light multitasking and light media editing. While it’s not a high-performance machine for gaming or intensive content creation (like video editing), it can handle casual gaming at low to medium settings and moderate workloads without significant slowdowns.  Depending on the configuration, you might also get 8GB or 16GB RAM, which provides smooth multitasking, and 256GB or 512GB SSD options for faster boot times and quick file access. For most users, this setup is more than enough for daily productivity and light entertainment.  Design & Build Quality: The Dell Inspiron 5440 has a clean, modern design with a plastic chassis and metal accents. The build is solid for its price range, but it doesn’t have the premium feel of higher-end models like the XPS series. It’s relatively lightweight and portable, weighing around 1.5 to 1.7 kg, making it convenient for students or professionals who need a laptop for work or on-the-go tasks.  The keyboard is comfortable for typing, with well-spaced keys and decent travel, while the trackpad is responsive and supports multi-touch gestures.  Display: The 14-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display provides decent clarity and sharpness for work tasks, media consumption, and browsing. The color accuracy and brightness are generally good for indoor use, but it may fall short in direct sunlight or bright environments. For most users, it offers a solid viewing experience for typical usage, but it's not as vibrant as the displays found in more premium models.  Battery Life: The battery life on the Inspiron 5440 is typically good for a full day of light office tasks, with an estimated 6 to 8 hours of use on a full charge. This will depend on the specific configuration and your usage, but it's generally reliable enough for most users. For more intensive tasks like video streaming or gaming, the battery will drain faster.  Ports & Connectivity: The Dell Inspiron 5440 offers a variety of useful ports, including:  USB-A (2.0 and 3.0) USB-C HDMI (for connecting to external monitors) Ethernet port (for wired internet connection) SD card reader (helpful for transferring photos or files) Headphone jack These ports make it versatile for connecting external devices like storage drives, monitors, or headphones.  The laptop also offers Wi-Fi 6 for faster internet connectivity and Bluetooth for wireless accessories.  Sound: The audio quality is decent for casual media consumption. The built-in speakers are fine for video calls or listening to music in a quiet environment, but they lack depth and bass. For more immersive audio experiences, you might want to use headphones or external speakers.  Overall Value: The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a great value laptop for users who need a dependable device for everyday tasks like browsing, word processing, light media consumption, and light productivity. It offers good performance for the price, solid build quality, and long battery life, making it an excellent choice for students, remote workers, and budget-conscious professionals.  Final Thoughts: If you’re looking for a reliable laptop that covers all the basics and offers decent performance without a high price tag, the Dell Inspiron 5440 is a solid choice. It’s not a powerhouse for gaming or intensive creative work, but it offers good value for money with a reliable design, solid battery life, and satisfactory performance for everyday tasks.",POSITIVE

"Recently, I have purchased a dell laptop model inspiron 5440 (intel core 7 processor) from dell online store. I would like to share my experience.  I would never suggest any one to buy Dell laptop. I have heard before from my friends that Dell laptops are not good, you should never buy them. But, i did not listen to them and purchased this laptop spending a huge sum. I must tell you, the initial one was pathetic. I was facing one issue after another.  They call it thin an light model, but its fan never stop rotating. I have seen so many laptop with similar price range. At least for non of the them, the fan makes these loud noise. Thus i tried contacting dell technical support. They told me, mam, for this model the fan will make this loud noise. There is no solution to it. After that, they remotely installed some software.  Next, i faced speaker issue. There was no sound coming out of my laptop. Again i contacted the dell technical team, they did some thing and it was working fine. But at the same time laptop became slow.  So the technical expert next reset my pc. She was suggesting me to reinstall the operating system also. I told her, it has been only 5 days i bought this laptop, is it necessary.  Now also when i am writing this review, my fan keeps on rotating.  I, being from a middle class family, spend our hard earned money, to buy a good laptop for study purchase. But, i realized now, i have lost a huge sum of money by spending it on this laptop.  Dell website says , you can return our product in 14 days if you don't like it. But their technical support person says neither we will replace it nor you can return it. That means ""Even if you got a defective piece you should keep it"".  I can not get back my money. But at least you should not spend a penny on this useless dell product. I hope my review helps you to make better judgment regarding purchase of dell product. My personal suggestion is please don't buy it. I have been on so much mental stress these days because of the amount of money i spent on this product. And the inspiron 5440 turns out to be total waste",NEGATIVE

"Honor consistently delivers laptops that deliver a great combination of performance and value. It’s easy on the eyes as the display is amazing “the most attractive laptop I’ve seen this year .But this laptop is not just about looks , the performance is also brilliant.Powered by a 12th Gen Intel Core i5 processor with integrated Intel graphics,the Honor MagicBook X14 12th Gen with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD it proves to be the best laptop in this segment .And it easily sailed past my expectations. Following are my observations after using it for few days.  1. From the time i have started using it, i was surprised to get around 11 hours of average battery life with a single charge  2. Since it provides a superfast Type-C charger, the charging is fast and the charger looks heavy but it fits in all sockets.  3. Camera quality 720p is decent enough in this price range, for my professional day to day meetings  4. Fingerprint is convenient , webcam is good. On the whole, this laptop is phenomenal.  5. Rebooting is superfast and working simultaniously with multiple applications, webpages and MS office tasks is smooth  6. The backlit option is great to work in dim light environment with three stages of Backlit options to choose the best fit.  7. Keypad quality is really & it looks fantastic",POSITIVE
"Decent buy for normal office usage or student laptop. Model: X16 PRO 16GB 512 SSD PROS 1. Battery is good, use laptop stand for better heat dissipation 2. Screen is clear and HD 3. speed is good and responsive in Windows 4. Keyboard backlight brightness is good, but on key stroke only enabled, not always. 5. Sound is moderate  CONS: 1. For heavy programming RAM spikes up a lot due to usage and Windows itself consuming 6GB+ RAM 2. Better go with only 16 or 16+ RAM laptops 3. No Licensed MS office software 4. Graphics card is poor, spiking even for Youtube Videos. 5. Camera is Worst 6. External Display screen transmission quality is poor, poor projection  Overall Opinion: 1. It's best for basic usage with MS office and basic coding softwares. 2. For full time programming, go for other best options 3. BEST for students - under 50K, on sale it is 47.7 K",NEGATIVE
"HONOR MagicBook X14 Pro 2024 is a game changer in its price segment. No other company offers this kind of processor and performance in this range. The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-13420H makes multitasking smooth and efficient. I bought the 8 GB RAM variant initially but was so impressed with its performance and build quality that I decided to get the 16 GB version as well. The reason for this upgrade simply states that the main reason for this is while the 8 GB version handles all everyday tasks without a hitch, the 16 GB version is still better suited for heavier multitasking and application launching. However, this is soldered, so it cannot be upgraded-it would be a bit more future-proof if upgradable. But the LPDDR4x RAM is very fast, so that balances out the lack of upgradability.  The full metal body with backlit keyboard gives this product a premium look and feel that the competitors cannot match. Other brands might provide similar specifications; however, they do not provide this sleek design and build quality. All in all, it's a great option if you're looking to upgrade with great performance, looks, and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg!",NEGATIVE

"Great product! If you're considering purchasing it, definitely go for the i7 version. While you can always connect an extra screen and keyboard to address its smaller size, you should never compromise on the processor. I used it for video rendering, and its speed literally blew me away.",NEGATIVE

"I am extremely frustrated and feel completely cheated after purchasing this HP laptop on Amazon! Within just a week of buying it, the laptop began overheating. I immediately requested a return, but was convinced by Amazon and HP customer service that the issue would be resolved. A technician came from HP who changed thermal gel, but just a few weeks later, the overheating problem returned.  Now, despite multiple attempts to contact HP for further assistance, they’ve stopped responding. The technician promised to visit again, but it's been over two weeks with no word. Meanwhile, Amazon refuses to help since the return window has expired, and they are redirecting me to HP. HP’s customer service is a nightmare! Despite multiple emails and phone calls, I can’t get anyone to resolve the issue. HP is not entertaining to return or exchange the laptop for other piece.  I am now stuck with a laptop that is practically useless, and it feels like I’ve been abandoned by both Amazon and HP. I’ve learned my lesson the hard way: never buy expensive electronics from Amazon. They wait for the return window to expire so they can wash their hands of any responsibility. And HP? They clearly couldn’t care less.  If you value your hard-earned money, do yourself a favor and avoid buying from Amazon. Take your business to a local store instead. This laptop has been nothing but a waste, and I’m left with no solution in sight! Be careful!!  Rest if you are filthy rich and don't care for your Rs 50000+ money, you are welcome to do any adventure! Unfortunately, I am stuck.",NEGATIVE

"I’ve been using this laptop for a few weeks now, and I’m thoroughly impressed with its performance! From the moment I powered it on, everything runs incredibly smooth. The speed is remarkable, whether I’m multitasking with multiple apps, editing large files, or even gaming. The processor handles everything I throw at it without any signs of slowing down.  The display is stunning—sharp and vibrant, which makes working for long hours much easier on the eyes. Battery life is also a pleasant surprise, lasting me through a full day of heavy use without needing to recharge constantly. And the design? Sleek and modern, making it perfect for both work and play.  Overall, if you’re looking for a laptop that delivers in terms of speed, performance, and looks, this is an excellent choice. Definitely worth every penny! Highly recommended.",POSITIVE

If any problem comes. Amazon is worst than any retail shop. The app just keeps going in circle when you try to connect with customer service. From the internet I somehow connected to their customer service. But I felt sorry for them as they don't have any clear instructions. Lenovo gave a DOA and seal packed the laptop. More than three weeks now. I am left with DOA and seal packed laptop. My money is struck and no laptop to use.,NEGATIVE
"After getting white screen innmy iphone 13 pro after 17.5.1 update I wanted to tell bye bye for apple products . So I was searching replacement for my macbook pro since last 3 weeks . After researching a lot this one felt like a good choice in every aspects , display , performance, gaming .  Having core ultra 9 is very good for any task , Intel arc graphics is integrated , but it's equivalent to 4gb graphics of 3050 series and pretty good . 32 gb ram is all enough for anything. First time in my life I never heard fan sound when Android studio running with emulator, which shows how good this laptop is in terms of performance. Played couple of games via game pass I got and they were good , but size of games are like 129 gb and all , that was surprising to me as I played games in laptop after years . But 1 tb SSD is all enough to have such 5 games . Battery life came 7 hours for me for mixed usage . As a security professional running kali linux in virtual box was very smooth and I didn't expect so much good performance for the price . So it's value for money. As by combining offers I got it around 86 k . It have amazing display and brightness, which even beats so called retina displays . Totally satisfied with the choice i made.",POSITIVE
"I wanted a laptop which will last for 3-4 years, The specs will take care of Android Studio and any type of coding for another couple of years. (You don't need this laptop for Web development, just buy lower models like 16GB/512GB intel ultra 5) Display: satisfied with the quality NOT with the brightness though, could have been 600nits. Processor+RAM+Storage: can't get better at this price (95K) range, especially for a Hybrid app developer. Battery: It will last easily for approx 6 hours with 70% Brightness. Webcam: Scam 1080p..? I don't know, camera feels like 720p MacBook webcam. Build quality: Just as good as MacBook with better key travel, amazing trackpad(glass). Speakers: Loud and clear with NO base at all. So, use headphone/Bluetooth speaker this shouldn't be big of a deal. Fan Noise: I can say for windows laptop the noise levels are very low. Consssss: I'm still not able get the output from USB type C (Monitor has 65W output + DP), I tried Multiple times. currently using HDMI to connect a monitor. I have no idea is it a Software issue or a hardware.",NEGATIVE

"I ordered a Samsung Galaxy Book 4 on November 11. I received the product on November 13, but when I opened it, I found that there were no Microsoft products included. The description mentioned that MS Office 2021 would be available, which means it should come with a lifetime purchase.  When I contacted Amazon customer care, they said the return would only be possible after December 12 — literally a month later. This meant I had to stop all my work and wait for them, which also blocked my money.  After a long discussion, they told me I needed to courier the product back. Since I urgently needed the issue resolved, I went ahead and sent the product back myself.",NEGATIVE
"Poor battery backup , need to charge every 3hrs",NEGATIVE
Very nice design 👍🏻.I liked it.Also many people think that it has ms 365 for Life time but it has ms 2021 only.Which is enough for normal use.Also it has a backlight ⌨️.  All though you should buy it if it is available under 55 k.,POSITIVE

"Nice compact laptop. Decent built quality. Perfect for students, office use . MS Office home edition avaliable. Overall decent product in this category.",POSITIVE
This is hands down the most well configured laptop in this price range. The best thing is that this laptop has DDR5 RAM and the latest generation of AMD 7000 series processor. However would have preferred support for Gen 2 USB Type C for faster and more convenient charging options. The installed m.2 ssd is slower than some of the options available in this price range. Light gaming is very much possible with tweaking the system but it's not recommended as this laptop wasn't built with such scenarios in mind. Overall a very good option for a work and light entertainment oriented laptop in a tight budget.,POSITIVE

"Everything about this laptop is good. The screen is a crisp 3.2k, processor is fast, thin and very light. Keyboard is great and weight is minimum. There is only 1 issue. It heats up like crazy. Especially the area between the top of the keyboard and the screen (the place where the hinges are). The whole area heats up like crazy. Its still a top line piece and worth the money.  Edit after 3 months: the battery life is 3 hrs. this is very very bad.",NEGATIVE

"Hello, i have been using this laptop for 7 days now. It has some good features and some bad ones. This laptop firstly came with an intel core i3 12th gen processor which has a quite good reputation. This computer is very butter smooth multitasking laptop. It has 8GB of Ram which makes the laptop capable to run multiple apps and chrome tab without any hassle, it doesn't take much time to open chrome. This computer aslo has a NVMe 512GB SSD, i love how they added this SSD to make the laptop faster, the boot time of this laptop is less than 9 seconds (depending on how may applications are installed). It is a very fast SSD in your budget (i think). The battery backup is kinda good, it keeps your laptop on the go for almost 10 hours without its charger (depending on what you are doing on the laptop). This laptop is equipped with Intel UHD 780 graphics with 4GB VRAM which makes the laptop capable of mid video editing and photo editing without hassle. Asking about gaming, I played Tom Clancy's The Divisions, GTA V on this, i got almost smooth 60fps on 720p lowest settings. Since i told the good side of it. Here are some drawbacks of this laptop. This laptop have poor sound quality like the volume is too low for me i think. That's all...",NEGATIVE

Core i3 suitable for moderate use. Good build and enough connectors on either side. Very cost competitive.,POSITIVE
Received the laptop yesterday only. The Display type is not mentioned any where in the products specification page in amazon. Its an TFT display with narrow viewing angles. however the display looks crisp when looking from front. Sound volume is very low cannot be used for video conferencing or attending class if there is ambient noise around. Otherwise the laptop feels preppy and fast. On the software side the laptop lacks MS office license which have to be purchase separately. Better to go for laptops that come with MSO.,NEGATIVE

"Fast and Cool !!  I simply loved this laptop. My previous laptops provided by company were Intel series and used to get hot 🔥🔥 even during basic tasks. This AMD chip works flawlessly in Indian hot weather.  Asus is amazing as usual. Was a big fan already after having used their products for many years.  They have maintained their quality. In fact getting better. Kudos to the team!  I thoroughly liked their cloud recovery option. It installs Windows smoothly along with all required drivers whenever you may need.  Hardware built quality is good. However finishing and aesthetics could have been better like some glowing effect, smoothness etc on outer body.  OLED screen is nice. Good to spend few more thousands for it.  Sound quality is way too inferior. Don't know why they didn't care about it. We might need to use external USB DAC for better sound output.  Keyboard layout is nice and feels good to type in.  Overall an excellent product 🤩",POSITIVE
"I am giving a short review display is the highlight here and to be honest its the best display and premium kind of feel (body) u can get in the price point of 55-60k.  But here is the catch the storage i got has some issues i run benchmark and it was pretty much low af. Brand claims it's gen 3 ssd nvme m.2 so it should be on avg 3500mbps r/w speed but it's in 800mbps feel such a disappointing. I looked into google and many users got same issues so yeah it's not on my unit only.  Another issue i noticed that there is a low frequency continues spark sound coming below the keyboard area so i have requested a replacement and Good service by Amazon they did quick response.  Although it's not a major drawback but if it would have there then it would have been really amazing. I am talking about FP sensor. So for those who really want that its not present in this model sadly.  Battery backup on 1-2 usage is impressive like screen on time is around 6hr with light usage (few benchmark, chrome surfing, Multimedia consumption (watched a 2hr movie on speaker) and Excel stuff)  About performance it feel nice not shutter nothing. Chipset is good enough to handle most of the day to day work of regular user.  About weight it's actually good but yeah sometimes it struggles to open lid with one hand  About thermal management its okish not extremely well but good. Like i heard fan noise only when benchmark and heavy tasking.  Edit: Even after replacement the storage is having 800mbps-1500mbps so it's clearly that it's not a gen 3 ssd nvme m.2 so brand is scamming us. To be honest it affects and matters in many scenarios so avoid this model until and unless u can replace ssd with actual gen3 one",NEGATIVE

This is best laptop at this price point. With h series processor and boot up time of laptop is 6-7 sec and this processor is beast.Overall everything is good. Display is decent and u have to compromise with build quality and there is no fingerprint available. If you want best display and fingerprint then go with asus vivobook 16x .,POSITIVE

"So I bought this laptop in the month of Aug and since then I am using it, I could have bought M1 laptop but as it's performance is going down I prefered this, and I am completely being honest here so the pros - slim, light, easy to use, good build quality, Cons - heating problem( can't use it on flat surfaces and on lap no chance will make you feel like somebody turn on the heater) Battery problem sometimes even less then 2 hours when I am using multiple things, on words and basic use max 4 hrs. I think if I will get a chance to buy again I would have gone for samsung book or M1, they are much better in battery and heating issues.",NEGATIVE

Battery backup : 3-4hrs in normal use and if it is kept in battery saver and brightness at below 50% it lasts for 5-6 hrs and turning off backlit keyboard. But 41whr battery is not that much good. 5.Processor: core ultra 125h is a good one which contains 14 cores.

"I recently purchased the HP 15s with the 12th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, and I’m extremely happy with my decision! The laptop is sleek, lightweight, and has a modern design that looks great. The 15.6-inch display is clear and bright, making it perfect for both work and entertainment.  The performance is impressive! The 12th Gen Core i5 processor handles everything I throw at it with ease, whether it’s running multiple apps or streaming videos. I’ve noticed smooth multitasking, and it doesn’t slow down, even when I’m working with large documents or browsing with many tabs open.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the trackpad is responsive. I also appreciate the decent battery life, which lasts me through a full day of work without needing a recharge.  In terms of storage, the laptop comes with ample space, and it boots up quickly thanks to the fast SSD. The speakers deliver clear sound, which is great for video calls and media consumption.  Overall, the HP 15s 12th Gen Core i5 is a fantastic laptop for daily use, whether for work, study, or casual entertainment. It offers great value for the price, and I highly recommend it!",POSITIVE

"Laptop is working good, but heating quickly and 68wh battery also not lasting for long. The average battery time is 3 to 4 hours for the average python program running. On the positive side, good speed, anti-glare screen, nice keypad and mouse track pad. Suitable for all type of works (considering the negatives mentioned above) Overall rating for this product is Above average. One cheating issue by Seller or Amazon: This product comes with the back to college offer. When I tried to register for it, the website is asking for the state (location) and the seller name. The seller Appario is not available in that HP offer claiming site. I dialed to Amazon to check about it, they asked me to wait for a minute and then they disconnected the call without a courtesy. So seller is cheating with this offer and Amazon is supporting the seller. It is too bad. I did not considered this bad experience in my rating star of 4/5. If I would have considered, my rating would be 2/5.",NEGATIVE

"1stly - the price. Got it on sale for ₹21k, and as someone who works in the dark all the time, finding a laptop at this price that has a Backlit Keyboard is a dream come true.  2ndly - Keyboard and mouse trackpad. Keyboard is backlit and has two brightness levels when on - medium and high. Medium is good enough, high might eat more battery. Just an observation, the backlight will be off everytime you boot up, regardless of what it was set to before. Key press virtually soundless, and feel soft; very similar to dell keyboards. Mouse trackpad is as smooth as Macbooks. Gestures all work nicely, and multi-finger scrolls and swipes are all silky smooth.  3rdly - Battery life. Been getting almost 3 to 4 hours on full charge with mostly for work - Excel, 4 to 5 Chrome tabs, and a couple background apps running.  4thly - Upgradable RAM. YES! It's motherboard comes with unremovable 8gb RAM, and an empty DDR4 SO-DIMM Laptop RAM slot. 8+8gb is more than enough to turn this into a mini performance beast with absolutely no lag at all with the included Windows 11 OS. Just make sure to double check the built-in 8gb RAM's MHz speed and match it accordingly. In my case, I went with G.Skill's 3200MHz CL-22 8GB SO-DIMM Laptop RAM stick.  5thly - Windows 11. Microsoft has finally nailed it with their OS. This is coming from someone who absolutely abhorred Win10 so much, and shifted to MacOS in 2015, and now switching back to Win11. Needed a quick and budget laptop 'cause my 13"" rMacbook Pro's screen fully cracked, and I must say, I was pleasantly pleased with how buttery smooth everything is, similar to MacOS if not better. Actually, it is better, given all the extra things Windows could always let you do, but now with all that extra smoothness. Took me about 15 minutes, to set everything up, and get it looking as close as possible to classic Windows UI (harken back to them peaceful XP days).  6thly - Build quality is great. Feels and looks premium. Very mild wobbling, but the hinges feel stable and sturdy. Underside has one long vent for airflow and two speaker vents. Laptop isn't rated for any kind of water protection, but I must mention that it ended up getting quite wet, if not soaked in the December 2023 Chennai floods. The laptop was in my messenger bag and the bag fell completely submerged in water. Didn't switch it on for 2 weeks, removed the battery and kept it in a bucket of dry rice(yes that old ""hack"") along with the charger as well, gently wiped off any visible wetness on the momboard, closed up and dried the machine in the sun a few hours everyday, put it all back together after 2 weeks, booted up with much suspense, and it all works as usual despite everyone(online and support) saying otherwise. Altho there were visible water spots under the screen, after almost 2 months now it has dried and reduced 95% on its own.  7thly - Performance. Now, don't go expecting to use this for high end gaming, get a console for that. For minimal, and light gaming it works great. Installed Need For Speed Most Wanted 2005 and just completed it again after many years. Worked flawlessly on max graphics settings - was getting 60fps with slight dips in framerate when the screen gets a little busy.  Lastly - Service & Support. The Chuwi support was quite responsive through WhatsApp. Upon first boot, it showed Win11 wasn't activated and panic started kicking in. Before I kicked myself any further, tried reaching out to Chuwi support. They wanted to send a technician over to activate it which would've taken a day or two - my impatience meant I couldn't and wouldn't wait at all. Took a bit of back and forth messaging on WhatsApp, but they eventually sent over the Product Key to activate Windows, and I easily did it myself pretty quick. In the case of local servicing, they have designated technicians in each city with whom they've tied up with to provide service.",POSITIVE

"The Chuwi CoreBook is an impressively powerful laptop for the price. With its Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD, it offers smooth performance for day-to-day tasks like web browsing, office work, and even some lightweight photo and video editing.  I was pleased by how lightweight and slim the aluminum alloy body feels. The CoreBook is easy to carry around the house or toss in a bag to take on the go. The narrow bezels surrounding the 14.1-inch 1080p screen give it a modern look and allow for a compact footprint overall.  The backlit keyboard feels snappy and responsive when typing. I was able to type quickly and accurately thanks to the well-spaced layout. The large clickable trackpad is also accurate and smooth. Battery life is fairly strong as well. I got close to 8 hours of mixed usage on a single charge consisting of web browsing, streaming video, and document editing. This should get most users through a full work or school day without issue.  Considering its combination of performance hardware, premium metal body, backlit keyboard, and competitive battery life, the asking price of around 24000/- INR feels like an incredible value. For budget-minded buyers who still want power and build quality, the Chuwi CoreBook is easy to recommend. It punches well above its class and serves as a capable daily driver laptop for work, school, and general use.",POSITIVE
"This thin, affordable laptop is a gem. Its portability is unmatched, making it perfect for on-the-go tasks. The trackpad is responsive, ensuring seamless navigation. With Windows 11, the user experience is top-notch. The 512GB SSD and 8GB RAM provide ample storage and smooth multitasking. It's a steal for the price, striking a balance between affordability and performance. Ideal for work and daily use, this laptop proves you don't need to break the bank for quality. If you crave a budget-friendly, portable powerhouse, this is your go-to device.",POSITIVE
Value for money product and display is good but charging not so good.,NEGATIVE
"I was very surprised by the value of this laptop in this price range. I bought it to see if it was as good as other reviews said it was. I had in mind to try it and return it if necessary. After a few days of use, I knew I was definitely keeping it. I was amazed at the great screen resolution. The audio is surprisingly very good. Very happy with the battery life and speed of the processor. It's light and sleek. The only thing that concerned me initially, is having only 1 USB port. So far no problem. I'll just get an adapter if needed. I Never heard of this brand, but this is truly a great buy on a laptop.",POSITIVE
"I got this laptop as a gift for my dad to replace his 7yr old Lenovo. I was a bit wary at first of this brand, but I was willing to try it, as the main brands were selling new laptops with old components at a high price due to the supply shortage.  This laptop is great for just slipping in your bag and heading out. It’s very thin, super lightweight, and has a pretty sturdy metal construction.  I got it primarily for running Inkscape, but it may do a bit of light gaming at low settings.  I love the 3:2 aspect ratio, and the 2K resolution really pops out. It also is able to display more on the smaller screen due to the higher pixel density.  Speaking of the small screen, the 14” (I think it’s closer to 13.6”) panel is a bit of a downgrade if you’re used to bigger screens. If you’re looking for a 15” or above, this isn’t the laptop for you.  One downside of such a thin laptop is a lack of I/O ports. It has one USB-A 3 port and a 3.5mm headset jack on the right side, and one USB-C port on the left. The charging port is also on the left side, and this laptop does not support USB-C power delivery.  If you want to output to an external display or connect more than one flash drive, you’ll need a USB-C dock. But these minor problems are to be expected with such a thin laptop.  Now, it may just be me, but I thought the keyboard felt very cheap. It had a bit of play around each key, and I did not enjoy the typing experience. I think it may have been the switched the manufacturer used in the laptop, but I figured it was acceptable in a non-mainstream laptop.  I noticed that the metal skin of the laptop picked up smudges and fingerprints rather easily. Not a dealbreaker for me.  If you are looking for an aggressively decent laptop that looks a bit like a MacBook Air, this is the one for you.",NEGATIVE
"Cheap metal, 1 mega pixel front camera, 1 single usb port, no HDMI slot, no SD card slot, buggy touchpad, 1.5 hr max battery life, overheats easily, not for light gaming. But worst of all 2 months after use it starts making a high pitch when running, making it impossible to keep using it without getting a headache. Seller would not reimburse or accept return. Buy name brands dont waste your money on this.",NEGATIVE
"Most of the time that I am about to buy something from a brand that I don't know, I get very suspicious. This computer has been one of the best purchases I have ever done here on amazon. The computer is fast, and the screen is very bright. It is also very light and perfect for me to take to school. I would say that this computer maybe can run some games, but not the high-end ones because you will need a better GPU. I don't think you will find a better deal than this computer.",POSITIVE
"Pros: Sleek design. Good performance for multitasking and light gaming, but will probably need another 8gb ram stick to maximize efficiency. Tactile keyboard with back lighting. Good WiFi range and connectivity 2k HD Screen. USB-C Charging. 512GB Storage.  Cons: Battery life is questionable unless you're strictly web browsing or typing in word expect under 2 hours of use. Exhaust and speakers at the bottom of the chassis can be problematic if not placed on a flat surface. Power button placement is not ideal and can be pressed on accident while typing or handling the laptop. Track Pad could be better. Fingerprint Magnet.",NEGATIVE

"I purchased it recently and I'm satisfied with the looks, performance and battery backup. Only thing I feel is the low audio sound. I have to connect my earphone for audio clarity.",NEGATIVE
"Hp ultra 7 is continuously heating like a 10 year old laptop. No resolution has been provided, waiting for 10 days. No way to contact amazon. Before purchasing amazon showing easy return, but it's hectic. When I clicked on return issue, it have to repeat the process so many times like a loop. Still waiting",NEGATIVE
"The laptop would be an excellent choice for students. Windows 11 (Home) is smooth and fast. For study and office works the laptops config is more than enough. Design very sleek, screen brightness ok, sound loud enough, Web Cam sufficient for video calls, fingerprint very responsive. MS Office 2021 included, which makes it an excellent choice for students. Value for money, recommended.",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop at effective price of 30000 with all the cashback etc. Which is reasonably well, considering nowadays phones of 8 gb Ram are also in the same price range.  Ofcourse there are some shortcomings but I understand why they are there. Manufacturer have to drop something to provide this laptop at great price. Really good for students who can't afford expensive laptops. Even 60-70 thousand laptops are not useful after a while. I'm intending to use this for 2 years, so I guess this will do the job  Pros: 1. Battery life is good, you can easily use it for 6 hours with average use. I suggest to use dark theme to further increase the battery life. 2. Performance is good, so far able to handle multi tasking. I tried copying data, the tranfer was super fast. 3. Build quality is good, considering a non- metallic back, it looks good, light and portable. 4. Camera Sutter is nice feature at this price point. 5. Finger print scanner. 6. Microsoft office licence.  Cons:  1. Speakers are useless, low volume. Taking meetings on this laptop would be difficult as well. Workaround is that to carry earphones all the time. 2. No USB charging, it would have been great. Now I have to carry two charges, one for phone and another for laptop. 3. Keyboard have lesser spacing inbetween the keys, I kept pressing wrong keys all the time. More surprising is the fact that there's 1 inch space left either side of the keyboard. Not sure why they squeeze keys in limited space. 4. Camera quality is also poor, looks like a camera from 2006 laptop. 5. Display is also really average, when you look at different angles it doesn't work that we'll. 6. Heating is also felt, I haven't started using the laptop, just exploring it still I could hear the fan running.",NEGATIVE
"Build Quality: 4/5 The laptop has excellent build quality. Although it doesn't feature a metal body, the polycarbonate material used is of good quality and feels sturdy.  Keyboard: 2/5 The keyboard feels uncomfortable to use. The build quality seems cheap, and it lacks aesthetic appeal. It does not provide a satisfactory typing experience, especially for someone who works extensively on a laptop.  Power Management: 2.5/5 Power management is just average. It neither excels in battery backup nor provides efficient usage for long durations. A mediocre performance overall in this department.  Display: 1/5 As someone with 10 years of IT experience and extensive exposure to different laptops, this display is by far the worst I have encountered. The quality is extremely poor, making it unsuitable even for basic tasks. This is a major drawback and a significant reason I would no longer consider ASUS laptops in this price range (₹26,000).  Performance: 3/5 The laptop is powered by an i3-1235U/1215U processor and 8GB of RAM. For the price, it's adequate for basic tasks such as video playback and office documentation. However, it is not built for multitasking or more demanding applications, which is understandable given the specifications.  Price: 3/5 Considering the display quality, even a price below ₹20,000 would not justify this purchase. There are better options available in this range, and the display alone makes it hard to recommend this laptop.  Overall: 2/5 This laptop has been a lifetime worst experience for me. The display is horrible—very bad quality, and the performance is just passable for basic tasks. Power management is average at best. Overall, this laptop fails to deliver value for its price and does not meet expectations, even as a budget device. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Asus Vivobook 14 and unfortunately, my experience has been quite frustrating. While the laptop initially seemed promising, I've encountered significant issues with the touchpad that has significantly impacted my overall satisfaction.  Touchpad Issues: * Inconsistent Tracking: The touchpad often exhibits inconsistent tracking, making it difficult to navigate smoothly and accurately. This can be particularly annoying when performing precise tasks or gaming. * Accidental Clicks: The touchpad is overly sensitive, leading to accidental clicks and cursor jumps. This can be frustrating and disruptive, especially when typing or working on documents. Other Concerns: While I haven't experienced any major performance issues, the build quality feels a bit flimsy for a laptop at this price point. The plastic casing doesn't inspire confidence in its durability.  Except this issue I have faced, there is another drawback of purchasing this laptop is keyboard is without backlit support but on App they mentioned that this laptop has backlit chiclet keyboard.  Conclusion: I'm disappointed with my purchase of the Asus Vivobook 14. The touchpad issue and non availability of backlit keyboard, have significantly hindered my enjoyment of the laptop. If you're considering this model, I would strongly recommend researching other options or carefully considering these potential drawbacks.",NEGATIVE

It is a decent laptop for its price..butttt it has a big problem problem (which probably isn't solvable).it has major frame drops even in the lowest graphics settings.i have played rdr2 and the laptop is capable of getting over 65fps on High settings but it suddenly drops to like 15 -20 which does not give u a nice gaming experience.I honestly regret buying this laptop.i searched for solutions on yt and Google but none of them seem to work..but I did find a temporary fix but it doesn't give you the full performance..u can try changing the performance to quite in the hp omen hub it reduces the performance but works for some games(on quite mode I get around 50fps in rdr2 on high settings with no frame drops)this might work on some games...(This was for the rx6500m model idk abt the others if they have the same problem),NEGATIVE

"Reviewing after 1 month of usages!! First I'm confused about this laptop because of the negative review ,it's a great laptop for basic use & for professionals. Pros- -The build quality is good 👍🏻, - the design is very sleek smooth - keyboard quality and keys are good, ☺️ -Processor is beast very much satisfied , -Battery life is also average max 4 hr to 5 hr depends on usages , - lenovo service is so good I can say cause I noticed that my touchpad is sometimes lagging(coz of BIOS not uptodate) so I connect with the support team in lenovo offical website , he fixed it in just 10 mins! ☺️  CONS - Brightness is bit low have to set in 80 to100 range - speaker sound is average! - while charging the heating issue felt but not very much - only 60hrz refresh rate not satisfied - sometimes display wombling not much but little - backlit light is dim. Overall it'a good laptop ♥️ 4.5/5 If your priority is not gaming or editing then you can go for it! 👍🏻",POSITIVE
Almost using it for 5 days :-  Pros :- 👍👍 .) Build quality💥 .) Display worth the money .) Battery life - I got 7.5 hrs with normal usage ( offline movies + YouTube + Browsing + Pdf reading) with Wifi and Bluetooth turned on all the time...I kept brightness at 30% ( since It is sufficient for me in indoors ) and in dark mode... Another time I got only 5.5 hrs of battery life...so not sure of the exact battery span. .) Flip to start is very useful .) Booting time is only 10-15 secs max .) Performance is good for this budget .) Light weight and very convenient to use especially for studying  Cons :- 👎👎 .) Heating issue while charging😮‍💨 .) Sometimes it heats up even with normal usage .) Speaker is good but sound is low .) Missing fingerprint sensor/Facial recognition in this range  Tips :- .) Don't charge immediately after using for more hours...let the heat to cool down and then charge .) After charging let the heat to cool down..then start to use ( will Increase battery span )  Product got delivered b4 the due date...and packaging was good 👍  Conclusion : Simply go for it if you are a student and doesn't play that much of games💥,NEGATIVE

"I bought this laptop few days back. There was an issue with the screen so I had to return/replace it. The amazon guys has been lying from start. They said they were going to initiate a lenovo technician visit. I waited for 2 days, no one came so I called lenovo directly. They said they had no notification regarding any booking of technician visit.  Once I booked the technician visit in lenovo's side a visit was arranged. In the meantime amazon kept telling me that their hands are tied as long as the product is not sealed by lenovo. Once lenoco technician checks the project and gives no objection for return we will return/replace it immediately. Now it has been almost 2 weeks, everyday a return is created and gets cancelled saying the product was not ready when actually no one visited.  My biggest mistake was to buy it from amazon. The laptop is actually good. But directly from lenovo or may ve croma.",NEGATIVE
"It's very slim , The build is plastic but it's very tough , the display is FHD and it's a good display, The processer is actually a beast but you need to use it on charging to utilise it's full capacity , battery backup despite of having a H series processor and 48W Battery it performs very well and give you a 5hr screen on time the sound isn't too loud but if you keep it on your lap or so then you won't face any issue , And the main keypoint of this laptop is it's i7 13gen processor which is very very powerful but remember it has a intel UHD graphics so you are not going to play any graphics involving games it won't be a smooth experience overall a good product for real",NEGATIVE
"First of all thanks to Amazon for the fastest deliveries less than 24 hours with good shape. Now on the laptop front superb finish love at first sight, it is a clean laptop with all the essential features. Top lid is of metal a premium quality laptop with precise cut at each and every corner. It is a 12th Generation i5 - 12450H processor laptop due to which no issues at the processing of task no matter what you give, it run as a breeze, no fingerprint sensor, no graphics card it had a internal graphics card which is terrible if you want this laptop for gaming purpose then do not purchase this. I have purchased this as i have no use of graphics card.  Pros:  ASPECT RATIO: 16:10 ( Major highlight which is helpful in Coding ) SCREEN : IPS Panel with 60Hz resolution with good viewing angle. CHARGER: 65 Watt Charger with USB type C FRONT CAM: 720p with privacy shutter. SSD: 500 GB (with upgradable option) TRACK PAD : Very nice wide and smooth scroll with good tactile feedback. BACKLITE KEYBOARD : YES  Cons:  RAM: 16 GB ( not upgradable this is a major downside of this laptop which is so expensive) HDD: ( no slot for HDD ) FINGERPRINT : NO GRAPHICS CARD: Inbuilt  HEATING ISSUE:  Most important due to which I gave it a less rating since Lenovo knows it is a H series processor therefore vents should be cut out at the side end of the laptop but at present the vent is at the screen & bottom end due to which when performing high priority tasks it becomes hot as it is clocked at base 2.0 Ghz the keyboard area becomes hot and due to vents placed at screen side screen & metal lid becomes hot not that much hot but still a premium laptop Ideapad 5 series should not have this kind of issues. During benchmark test the keyboard area becomes serious hot and the screen area the right bottom area becomes hot due to vent throwing air at the screen.",NEGATIVE

"Apart from build quality which does not seems to me great but in terms of every other thing...this product is best in class for every task. And most valuable for the range of 60k to 65k.  The Features it provides me at 61k,  • Basic display with 144hz • Good CPU : Intel i5 12450H gaming Processor • Decent GPU: Nvidia Rtx 3050 with 75watts of TGP • 16GB DDR4 RAM/ 512 GB SSD • GOOD THERMALS • Professional design and slim build (plastic) • MS office life time for students • Good battry backup  • Including all this feature in laptop The laptop has a great hardware features and professional looks but slightly decent build quality offered by VICTUS at a price for 60k at which other brands do little bit cost cutting at dispatch by giving 60hz penal and some brand provides low TGP. but this product belence every thing and still at the best price.  • But nowdays If you can go Litt further than must buy acer Nitro V cuz it offers very great in segment features like no other brands gives to their leptops. It's best product under 75k in any prespactive.  • If you have slightly low budget than by aspire 7 with same spacifications but slightly lower TGP and some other ignorable drawbacks which doesn't worth mentioning.  But You have 60 to 65k than it's a great product to buy in fact 1st ranked. 😊👍🏻✨",POSITIVE

"I recently purchased the HP Victus Gaming Laptop from Amazon, and I must say I am thoroughly disappointed with my purchase. I had high hopes for this gaming laptop, but it has fallen far short of my expectations.  First and foremost, the battery life is abysmal. I expected a laptop with decent battery performance, but I can barely get it to last for more than 2 hours of simple usage. It's incredibly frustrating to have to constantly be tethered to a power source when I had hoped to use it on the go. This severely limits its portability and functionality.  Moreover, the laptop's performance is far from what I anticipated. With its 12th Gen Intel Core i5-12450H and NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU, I expected smooth gaming and multitasking capabilities. However, I've experienced significant lag and performance issues that make it nearly impossible to enjoy gaming or perform tasks efficiently. It's disheartening to invest in a so-called gaming laptop and have it struggle with even the most basic of tasks.  Adding to my disappointment, I've tried reaching out to Amazon's customer service team for assistance with these problems, but they have yet to arrive at my home after two weeks of waiting. The lack of timely customer support is incredibly frustrating and adds to the overall negative experience.  In conclusion, the HP Victus Gaming Laptop has been a letdown in every aspect. The short battery life, poor performance, and lack of effective customer support have made this purchase a regrettable one. I would not recommend this product to anyone, and I'm left feeling unsatisfied and frustrated with my Amazon shopping experience.",NEGATIVE

"The HP Victus is a powerful laptop ideal for coding tasks. With its strong processors, ample RAM, and spacious display, it handles IDEs and multitasking efficiently.

Finally After some uses I'll updating this review Pro 1 Sound is loud enough to listen song or dialogue 2 Till now I haven't do coding or watching movies doing only gaming and it's giving out very good performance 3050 doing its job playing GTA V on high graphics and giving 120 to 140 fps so don't worry about it 3 Display is good not the best cause it's ips and brightness is also good 4 built is very good and premium feels like business laptop and the logo is standing out 5 Got the 200w fast charger Cons 1 screen wobbling Overall good laptop compared to price and specification This is the normal review based on uses only if you want detailed specifications there are other reviews also,NEGATIVE
"The look is too good . Worth the wait. Haven't tried games yet will update after trying . But till now it's too good except the hinge, it's too thin. But believe me we can ignore that, no one can notice that hinge issue . Battery life is expectable.",NEGATIVE
"I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:  Pros:  - Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences. - Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay. - Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips. - Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use. - Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.  Cons:  - Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check. - Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.  Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.  Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.  Rating Breakdown:  - Performance: 5/5 - Display: 5/5 - Battery Life: 4.5/5 - Design: 4.5/5 - Value: 5/5  Would I recommend it? Absolutely!",POSITIVE
"I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition. Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.  Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)  The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.  The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.  Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.",NEGATIVE
"Hi guys, Here is my review after using this laptop.  Laptop pro's - Design, price and performance.  Laptop design - This laptop's design feels premium and nice.  Laptop performance - It can handle GTA 5 smoothly. Also can record gameplay.  Laptop thermals - Laptop gets hot only during gaming. But it doesn't over heat as far as I used.  Laptop con's - I noticed some bugs/glitches like cursor while using in typing area or text box it gets white or kinda invisible I feel this maybe a bug.  -Screen goes off for a second sometimes while playing videos or browsing especially in battery power.  -Blue screen error: I have faced blue screen error two times till now while switching from power mode to battery mode(plugging out adapter).",NEGATIVE
"I bought an Asus TUF GAMING 15 from amazon on 16/10/2024.

"This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc... Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful. Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card. Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a ""battery care mode"" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!

"Hello, i have been using this laptop for 7 days now. It has some good features and some bad ones. This laptop firstly came with an intel core i3 12th gen processor which has a quite good reputation. This computer is very butter smooth multitasking laptop. It has 8GB of Ram which makes the laptop capable to run multiple apps and chrome tab without any hassle, it doesn't take much time to open chrome. This computer aslo has a NVMe 512GB SSD, i love how they added this SSD to make the laptop faster, the boot time of this laptop is less than 9 seconds (depending on how may applications are installed). It is a very fast SSD in your budget (i think). The battery backup is kinda good, it keeps your laptop on the go for almost 10 hours without its charger (depending on what you are doing on the laptop). This laptop is equipped with Intel UHD 780 graphics with 4GB VRAM which makes the laptop capable of mid video editing and photo editing without hassle. Asking about gaming, I played Tom Clancy's The Divisions, GTA V on this, i got almost smooth 60fps on 720p lowest settings. Since i told the good side of it. Here are some drawbacks of this laptop. This laptop have poor sound quality like the volume is too low for me i think. That's all...",NEGATIVE

Core i3 suitable for moderate use. Good build and enough connectors on either side. Very cost competitive.,POSITIVE
Received the laptop yesterday only. The Display type is not mentioned any where in the products specification page in amazon. Its an TFT display with narrow viewing angles. however the display looks crisp when looking from front. Sound volume is very low cannot be used for video conferencing or attending class if there is ambient noise around. Otherwise the laptop feels preppy and fast. On the software side the laptop lacks MS office license which have to be purchase separately. Better to go for laptops that come with MSO.,NEGATIVE
It's good product but there is no keyboard light it's causing problems when need to work on night.... please check all the details before buying thanks,NEGATIVE

Value for money, recommended.",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop at effective price of 30000 with all the cashback etc. Which is reasonably well, considering nowadays phones of 8 gb Ram are also in the same price range.  Ofcourse there are some shortcomings but I understand why they are there. Manufacturer have to drop something to provide this laptop at great price. Really good for students who can't afford expensive laptops. Even 60-70 thousand laptops are not useful after a while. I'm intending to use this for 2 years, so I guess this will do the job  Pros: 1. Battery life is good, you can easily use it for 6 hours with average use. I suggest to use dark theme to further increase the battery life. 2. Performance is good, so far able to handle multi tasking. I tried copying data, the tranfer was super fast. 3. Build quality is good, considering a non- metallic back, it looks good, light and portable. 4. Camera Sutter is nice feature at this price point. 5. Finger print scanner. 6. Microsoft office licence.  Cons:  1. Speakers are useless, low volume. Taking meetings on this laptop would be difficult as well. Workaround is that to carry earphones all the time. 2. No USB charging, it would have been great. Now I have to carry two charges, one for phone and another for laptop. 3. Keyboard have lesser spacing inbetween the keys, I kept pressing wrong keys all the time. More surprising is the fact that there's 1 inch space left either side of the keyboard. Not sure why they squeeze keys in limited space. 4. Camera quality is also poor, looks like a camera from 2006 laptop. 5. Display is also really average, when you look at different angles it doesn't work that we'll. 6. Heating is also felt, I haven't started using the laptop, just exploring it still I could hear the fan running.",NEGATIVE
"Build Quality: 4/5 The laptop has excellent build quality. Although it doesn't feature a metal body, the polycarbonate material used is of good quality and feels sturdy.  Keyboard: 2/5 The keyboard feels uncomfortable to use. The build quality seems cheap, and it lacks aesthetic appeal. It does not provide a satisfactory typing experience, especially for someone who works extensively on a laptop.  Power Management: 2.5/5 Power management is just average. It neither excels in battery backup nor provides efficient usage for long durations. A mediocre performance overall in this department.  Display: 1/5 As someone with 10 years of IT experience and extensive exposure to different laptops, this display is by far the worst I have encountered. The quality is extremely poor, making it unsuitable even for basic tasks. This is a major drawback and a significant reason I would no longer consider ASUS laptops in this price range (₹26,000).  Performance: 3/5 The laptop is powered by an i3-1235U/1215U processor and 8GB of RAM. For the price, it's adequate for basic tasks such as video playback and office documentation. However, it is not built for multitasking or more demanding applications, which is understandable given the specifications.  Price: 3/5 Considering the display quality, even a price below ₹20,000 would not justify this purchase. There are better options available in this range, and the display alone makes it hard to recommend this laptop.  Overall: 2/5 This laptop has been a lifetime worst experience for me. The display is horrible—very bad quality, and the performance is just passable for basic tasks. Power management is average at best. Overall, this laptop fails to deliver value for its price and does not meet expectations, even as a budget device. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased the Asus Vivobook 14 and unfortunately, my experience has been quite frustrating. While the laptop initially seemed promising, I've encountered significant issues with the touchpad that has significantly impacted my overall satisfaction.  Touchpad Issues: * Inconsistent Tracking: The touchpad often exhibits inconsistent tracking, making it difficult to navigate smoothly and accurately. This can be particularly annoying when performing precise tasks or gaming. * Accidental Clicks: The touchpad is overly sensitive, leading to accidental clicks and cursor jumps. This can be frustrating and disruptive, especially when typing or working on documents. Other Concerns: While I haven't experienced any major performance issues, the build quality feels a bit flimsy for a laptop at this price point. The plastic casing doesn't inspire confidence in its durability.  Except this issue I have faced, there is another drawback of purchasing this laptop is keyboard is without backlit support but on App they mentioned that this laptop has backlit chiclet keyboard.  Conclusion: I'm disappointed with my purchase of the Asus Vivobook 14. The touchpad issue and non availability of backlit keyboard, have significantly hindered my enjoyment of the laptop. If you're considering this model, I would strongly recommend researching other options or carefully considering these potential drawbacks.",NEGATIVE
"Very good product, I afraid to see most of the reviews, but it's must buying product. Amazon packing is amazing. Thank you Amazon for this type of service.

Firstly great laptop for the price but comes with a couple of issues. Issues : Came with a Chicony adapter ( not MSI branded one ) Boot lag issue where it takes 12-15 seconds for MSI logo to show up but after that everything else is fast ( seems like a BIOS issue that only MSI can fix with firmware update ) I have included video for reference Every other manufacturer laptop boots in under 10 seconds.  Slight heating issues under basic tasks  Speaker volume is on the lower side  Pros : The price to performance on offer is a steal i3 12th gen and 16gb at 35K Battery life is 3-4 hours Solid build quality you can feel it Great 180° hinge Light and easy to carry Enough ports Very snappy and responsive after booting Very minimal looks ( i love the design ) 1 hand open Display is not the most color accurate on paper but in real life its very good with thin bezels and great quality.  If only MSI would issue a firmware update to sort out the slow booting issue this laptop would have been a 10/10 from me.,POSITIVE
"Not sure why there is no review on this product. Got 12th gen i3 with 16gb ram, 512gb ssd for 35k. Only issue is the battery back up.. but getting much better than my think pad. Over all a great deal after 4 days of use.

"This laptop is newly launched in Q4 2021 and has all the features that can enable one to work for business/ office as well as entertainment purposes.  I did a lot of research before buying this laptop for my purposes and would like to share the same with you to make your decision easier.  The key features because of which I bought the laptop are: 1. Latest Windows 11 Software 2. 512 MB SSD / 8 GB RAM 3. 15.6 inch FHD screen (would have been better with IPS display, but I was ok to compromise on this in favor of other features) 4. Lifetime free Microsoft Office (no need to purchase separately) 5. Backlit keyboard 6. Tactile and smooth keys with very little travel and less sound 7. Loud and Good Dolby Speakers, easy on the ears 8. Good battery life (one charge can last upto 6-7 hours with medium usage of speakers and display brightness) 9. AMD Ryzen 5 5500 : Very nifty and quick processor. The boot time is approx 3 secs, which is fast.  This piece is good for office, music, movies and basic data analysis and games.  Would definitely recommend to buy this laptop as it is value for money",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 with the AMD Ryzen 5 5500U processor, and overall, I’m quite impressed! The laptop’s sleek design and lightweight build make it super portable, perfect for on-the-go use. The 15.6"" FHD display is vibrant and clear, providing a great viewing experience whether I’m streaming shows or working on projects.  The performance is solid thanks to the Ryzen 5 and 8GB of RAM. It handles everyday tasks like browsing, document editing, and even some light multitasking without any hiccups. The 512GB SSD is a huge plus, offering plenty of storage space and fast boot-up times.  My only minor concerns are the battery life and the speakers. While it lasts a decent amount of time for daily use, I wish it could go a bit longer on a single charge. Additionally, the sound quality from the speakers is adequate but not exceptional, so I often use headphones for a better audio experience.  Overall, the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 is a fantastic choice for students or professionals looking for a reliable, budget-friendly laptop. It combines performance and portability effectively, making it a great addition to my tech collection!",POSITIVE

"I am a loyal Amazon prime customer and frequently buy products online. Off the late Amazon's post-delivery support has become worst especially on high-value products purchase. This incident has made me lose all the trust on purchasing high-value(>20,000 INR) electronics products online. The 7-Day replacement process is totally misleading and has become a great pain. Below is the detail incident.  Amazon delivered this product ""Lenovo Ideapad-3"" on 06-JUL-2023, Thursday. After unpacking, I powered on the laptop and while going thru the initial settings, I found out that Keypad-1 on the keyboard was not working. This is clearly a hardware issue. So I went about the replacement process and was surprised to find out that first a technician from Amazon will arrive for an inspection and will try to resolve the issue. The technician did not arrive the next day and I had to reschedule again for the next day. So 2 days already lost. Finally the so called technician arrived on 09-JUL-2023, Sunday. The obvious expectation is that he will replace the non-working keypad and resolve. Instead he said he is there only for inspection of any damage and will install and run a diagnostic app which will check for software issues. This is so ridiculous given that the problem is with 1 keypad not working which is a hardware issue. The technician then took a video of the keypad not working and acknowledged the issue and left. I contacted Amazon support and they said that they were waiting for the report from technician and they will contact me after that. No one called anothe 2 days gone and I again followed up today 11-JUN-2023, Tuesday. Shockingly the Amazon support team informed me that the technician has filed a report that issue resolved which is a blatant lie. When I asked them to contact the technician, they were like as per the policy we cannot do that. I just don't understand what is the point in simply beating around the bush with this process and wasting customer's time and harassing the customer like this. Now they said they will arrange for another inspection from technician. This makes no sense as the issue is clearly with hardware. So at the time of writing its 6 days and I am sitting idle with the laptop. The whole point of ordering online is that 7 days replacement guarantee and the confidence. Instead Amazon support simply doing CUSTOMER HARASSMENT and misleading a loyal prime customer. Now I have to wait for the second so called technician to come and not sure what exactly he will do and have no idea as to when the replacement will be done. When we pay the money up-front the expectation is that service and support will work like that. Instead Amazon support is taking CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR GRANTED. After this incident from here-on, I believe a local retailer is far better when it comes to customer support and accountability. Should NEVER BY A HIGH VALUE PRODUCT ONLINE and 7 DAYS REPLACEMENT PROCESS FROM AMAZON IS TURNING TO A HOAX.",NEGATIVE
BEST PRODUCT,POSITIVE

The system was quite slow and WiFi connection kept dropping during the first start up configuration and windows update - ending up running throughout the night. Some of the keys were behaving erratically and failed within a week.,NEGATIVE
Good for students or working professionals. The processor is latest and fast. The battery backup is very good.,POSITIVE
"Laptop is a breeze to use, good performance and great screen quality but the body is very delicate not robustly built like dells and hps (mac is at another level)",NEGATIVE
"I purchased an ASUS laptop that was advertised to have a backlit keyboard but didn’t include this feature. Within three days, the laptop started showing defects. After contacting ASUS Service Center, they issued a DOA certificate. However, Amazon refused to accept the return, citing their return policy. Left with no choice, I filed a case with the consumer court. Only after 17 days did Amazon finally accept the return. This experience was highly frustrating and disappointing",NEGATIVE
Good for students. The laptop looks very stunning & the processor is also latest. Go for it Value for money,POSITIVE
"My first experience with this laptop:- They scamed me by showing that this laptop contains backlit in their product image, after receiving there was no backlit keyboard. The display quality and build quality is decent(i did run 4k videos from YouTube (it lagged a bit)) The performance is good, it does not lag. If you are looking for work/buissness oriented laptop with decent display quality then this is a good choice. Rest all features are good. I did get ms office lifetime and 1 yr antivirus of mcafee. Over all it's an average laptop. If you are looking for a good laptop with no backlit for coding then this is a good choice. Battery life is good. Weight is 1.6 kg. It has dual slot memory.",POSITIVE
The laptop and the specs are good But the build quality of this laptop is worst before buying a laptop please think of it once so that wont regret later for buying it There is lot of flex on the frame near the keyboard low quality of plastics are used on the down side,NEGATIVE

No OLED panel - This laptop has LCD panel which not viewing in other side , other side viewing negative image 2. No backlit keyboard 3.

The laptop is nice but not that good. I was expecting more than nice. The laptop has few major problems. Camera is one of them. Camera is definitely not a full HD. I mean I was disappointed by camera clarity. I have been using laptop from last 4 days. Battery is also an issue. It charges faster but. Battery drain is an issue in this laptop. Performance is nice. This is my opinion. After using this laptop for 4 days.,NEGATIVE
"Since first day i am facing wifi adapter problem, My internet is getting disconnected after few seconds. This is very frustrated and i have tried to reach HP team to help but still they don't have any solution. I am wasting my time and on top of that This model doesn't have LAN cable port so it is useless at the moment till wifi adapter gets fixed",NEGATIVE
"Good value for money,",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this laptop for my sister as she started her college journey, and it has proven to be a great choice!  For its price, this laptop delivers solid performance. It handles everyday tasks like note-taking, browsing, and streaming lectures smoothly. While it may not be a powerhouse for heavy gaming or complex design software, it’s more than sufficient for a typical college student’s needs.  The laptop is lightweight and easy to carry, which is a big plus for a student constantly on the move between classes. The sleek design adds a professional touch, and it looks more expensive than it actually is.  The battery life is commendable—lasting long enough to get through a full day of classes without needing a charge, depending on usage.  Overall, this laptop is a fantastic student-friendly option that balances performance and affordability. If you're looking for a dependable device for college, this is a great pick!",POSITIVE
Works as advertised! The included MS office was the clincher. Using for two weeks now! Cannot complain!,POSITIVE
"The product is running like as a refurbished is sent. The return is an harrowing experience, amazon making promises everyday but not taking back. Even the physical inspection was marked as done without anyone visiting to check and return.",NEGATIVE
Very good and easily uses product nice👍,POSITIVE
"1: Design is good. I bought the one with 14 Inch and it was damn beautiful.  2: Keyboard has backlit.  3: Processor, configuration is very nice - i3 core 12th gen, 8GB RAM, 512 GB SSD  4: Sound is nice  5: Screen can be improved. The colors are little distracted and too whitish. The screen panel could have been better. However, considering the price I will say it works.  6: It has Microsoft Office 21  7: Setting up is easy (ensure a good internet connection)  8: Price - I got it at INR 32190.  9: No fingerprint sensor  10: weight is decent, not too heavy considering you choose 14 Inch version.",POSITIVE

"This Lanovo laptop looks fine. But i have a major concern that I purchased this in last week of December 2024 and so my warranty of one year should be valid till December 2025, but it is showing that warranty started in July 2024. I need help and support on this issue.",NEGATIVE
"Even though the Microsoft Office package was supposed to be included with the laptop, as informed at the time of purchase, it was not included. This is very disappointing.",NEGATIVE
"This laptop is newly launched in Q4 2021 and has all the features that can enable one to work for business/ office as well as entertainment purposes.  I did a lot of research before buying this laptop for my purposes and would like to share the same with you to make your decision easier.  The key features because of which I bought the laptop are: 1. Latest Windows 11 Software 2. 512 MB SSD / 8 GB RAM 3. 15.6 inch FHD screen (would have been better with IPS display, but I was ok to compromise on this in favor of other features) 4. Lifetime free Microsoft Office (no need to purchase separately) 5. Backlit keyboard 6. Tactile and smooth keys with very little travel and less sound 7. Loud and Good Dolby Speakers, easy on the ears 8. Good battery life (one charge can last upto 6-7 hours with medium usage of speakers and display brightness) 9. AMD Ryzen 5 5500 : Very nifty and quick processor. The boot time is approx 3 secs, which is fast.  This piece is good for office, music, movies and basic data analysis and games.  Would definitely recommend to buy this laptop as it is value for money",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 with the AMD Ryzen 5 5500U processor, and overall, I’m quite impressed! The laptop’s sleek design and lightweight build make it super portable, perfect for on-the-go use. The 15.6"" FHD display is vibrant and clear, providing a great viewing experience whether I’m streaming shows or working on projects.  The performance is solid thanks to the Ryzen 5 and 8GB of RAM. It handles everyday tasks like browsing, document editing, and even some light multitasking without any hiccups. The 512GB SSD is a huge plus, offering plenty of storage space and fast boot-up times.  My only minor concerns are the battery life and the speakers. While it lasts a decent amount of time for daily use, I wish it could go a bit longer on a single charge. Additionally, the sound quality from the speakers is adequate but not exceptional, so I often use headphones for a better audio experience.  Overall, the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 is a fantastic choice for students or professionals looking for a reliable, budget-friendly laptop. It combines performance and portability effectively, making it a great addition to my tech collection!",POSITIVE
Very good quality,POSITIVE
"I am a loyal Amazon prime customer and frequently buy products online. Off the late Amazon's post-delivery support has become worst especially on high-value products purchase. This incident has made me lose all the trust on purchasing high-value(>20,000 INR) electronics products online. The 7-Day replacement process is totally misleading and has become a great pain.

"Laptop is working good, but heating quickly and 68wh battery also not lasting for long. The average battery time is 3 to 4 hours for the average python program running. On the positive side, good speed, anti-glare screen, nice keypad and mouse track pad. Suitable for all type of works (considering the negatives mentioned above) Overall rating for this product is Above average. One cheating issue by Seller or Amazon: This product comes with the back to college offer. When I tried to register for it, the website is asking for the state (location) and the seller name. The seller Appario is not available in that HP offer claiming site. I dialed to Amazon to check about it, they asked me to wait for a minute and then they disconnected the call without a courtesy. So seller is cheating with this offer and Amazon is supporting the seller. It is too bad. I did not considered this bad experience in my rating star of 4/5. If I would have considered, my rating would be 2/5.",NEGATIVE
the laptop is very good and it light weight. the speaker quality is exceptional. the only problem i have faced until now is it does get heated up quite a bit when we put it on charging and use it simultaneously.,POSITIVE
"Over heat, battery drain super fast only last for 3 hours, screen bleeding issue,over heat,very low performance.",NEGATIVE
"After looking at different brands & considering various configurations I finally decided on the HP Pavilion 14. The key reasons for choosing this laptop are:  1. Good Brand - HP 2. Decent Processor (Intel Core i5), intel iRISx Graphics, and 16GB DDR 4 3. Easy to carry around - 14"", Light Weight 4. Backlit, Good Looks, Finger Sensor, ....  Since Purchase:  1. Easy to setup 2. Windows 11 Home, Office 2021 (life time validity) 3. Super fast 4. Excellent display with warm color setting to block off the blue light 5. Fast charging  Very happy with my purchase ...",POSITIVE
"it has been 10-15days and laptop is working fine. I am mostly using it for lightweight coding and reading purpose. battery backup is actually ok , around 4-5 hrs with above workload. sound is ok too not that great but I expected that already.  what i really liked is the classic keyboard layout no wierd surprises and with good backlight fingerprint works fine.  Microsoft suite was provided on registration which popped up sometime after booting first time.",POSITIVE
"Overall a good product. The specification says SDcard reader but missing. Battery draining fast. Strangely during the battery saver and standby mode, the laptop getting heated up severely.",NEGATIVE
First of all thank you Amazon I get lower price in sales offer,NEGATIVE
Got the R7-8840U version. It is blazing fast. Battery life is good (4-7 hrs). Screen is ok. Great for office/college use. Best part is it's light weight. Loved it.,POSITIVE
Everything is good except the speaker volume is very less. At max sound also it’s hardly sufficient,NEGATIVE
"""I have experienced the worst quality of hardware possible. Within just a few days of purchase, I began encountering hardware issues, and there has been no timely support to resolve them.""  Better go for any third class product , that also will be better to this product",NEGATIVE
"Pros Lightweight, easily portable , Performance so far good Nice Display  Cons No Fingerprint sensor Occasionally heating issue faced while charging",POSITIVE
Reviewing after 1 day use. Will update later. Liked the product as of now.  Even if display is not amoled/OLED it's decent. No complain as of now. Performance is good. While charging some heating is there. But this can be ignored. Battery - Good to go  Concern - Hinge is not that tight. I guess with time it will be more loose.,NEGATIVE
I bought below 60k in sale worth the price 🤝🏻 very light weight with best processor 👍🏻👍🏻 I would definitely recommend ‼️,POSITIVE
"It is a Woderful laptop. I was unhapy with he Seller that he has simply wasted 5-6 days after placing the order and payment, he pached the item only after 6 days",NEGATIVE
"This is probably the most balanced and value for money product in this price segment. The display is superb and the RGB keyboard effects are awesome. You don't have many choices in this price segment. The Dell G15 has a good cpu but consumes a lot of power, the Lenovo LOQ has a motherboard problem, the Acer service is not that reliable in my area, won't buy an Asus in this price range(no specific reason for that) hence, the Victus was the best option available in this segment. It is a kind of versatile laptop and is not a gaming one. Perform all the tasks flawlessly. The HS processor is similiar to the H one but additionally saves battery providing the same performance. This laptop comes with an adaptive battery software which automatically manages the battery health and you don't need to limit it to 80 percent. The wobble issue has completely been sorted out. The build quality and the aesthetics looks classy for this product, neither overdesigned nor too simple. The sound is good, the camera is near average but acceptable keeping in mind the features it offers in this price range. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase. Will update the review further after a few months of use. Note: Don't forget to check the warranty status after the purchase. There is a possibility that it has already been activated.",POSITIVE
"Pros: - Decent build (4/5) - Very good screen (4/5) - Key board and touchpad (3/5) - Speed in heavy applications (4/5) - Price worthiness (5/5) - Webcam switch (Good option) - USB C charging (Yes with 100W PD Charger. It pops up a message asking to plug in original charger for heavy applications)  Cons: - No bag - No biometric login - Very heavy - Lid opening, need 2 hands compulsory",NEGATIVE
"I ordered the laptop on 26th December and got delivered on 28th December. Powered it on and after the initial setup , within minutes I got the blue screen of death error (BSOD) . The laptop got restarted automatically multiple times and the same error occurred. I powered down manually and powered it on again. The same error came. This happened on 28th night 10.45 PM, as my laptop got delivered around 9.30 PM on that day.  Immediately contacted amazon and they connected me to a technician and he guided me through some process, but nothing fruit full. So he arranged for a technician call back the next day.  On the next day two technicians called me within afternoon and said that a physical inspection needs to be done by the technician. Also they booked for the same. After two days a technician called me and asked for the location. He was from a nearby city of mine.  He came and saw the problem and said it was a motherboard issue. Also dropped a shocker news that now a days electronic products purchased from online are not original and some times they send you defective items also. Especially during festive times like Diwali (as I also Purchased on The Great Indian Sale). So he lodged the compliant as power issue, deviating from the original issue. He said HP might try to go for repair instead of replacement. It is a clear motherboard issue. So he took some videos with the laptop to lodge the complaint as power issue. It went on for 20-25 minutes. Then the request to issue DOA(Defect On Arrival) report was lodged by the technician with HP. After inspection the technician sealed the laptop along with the charger back into the box and sealed it with stickers. Make sure the stickers are not tampered or torn while giving back to the HP persons.  After 5 days I recieved my DOA report which is valid only for 14 days. Within this period you have to go for either return or replacement of the exact laptop. But unfortunately the replacement laptop was not available with them for the configuration which I have purchased from amazon.  Immediately after issuing the DOA report a case ID has been registered for this defect and there was regular tracking in the email.  all the communication will be taking place only thru email only. Make sure you have an working email.  A company called SAVEX was responsible for replacement of the HP laptops. Once the laptop gets delivered from amazon its between us and HP or the HP authorised service peoples. Amazon role is complete upon delivery. Then for further assistance we have to rely on HP only.  Then on the 12 th day they asked whether they can refund the money back as the replacement unit is not available in stock and they did not know when they will get units of that configuration. So I moved on for refund. They said that the laptop will be picked up from the service center from which they came to seal the unit and declare the unit as DOA.  I took the initiative, went and delivered the laptop in the office of the service technician. Then they gave me an acknowledgement slip. Scanned it and mailed. Then they asked for account details for refund gave that also in the mail.  Within 7 days I got my refund credited to my account.  The incident happened on October 26th by November 25th I got the refund amount. It felt like a huge win for me.",NEGATIVE
Nice product,POSITIVE
Sound and battery life is little bit low but we can mannage just because its Performance and Functionality. It has attractive display and also best brightness.,POSITIVE

"I've got the ryzen 3 5000 series 8gb variant in july 2024  It has been 2 days of using it The built quality of my unit is intact,no damage or scratches so far since delivery  Coming from using IPS display in desktop and amoled in cellphone the screen quality of the laptop feels dull but knowing what i paid for and got,I'm ok with it. if anyone is planning to get this product they will get used to the display quality eventually  I haven't installed anything yet and feel it's bit laggy but I'm ok with it,as I don't play games and will use it for online work and other productive work which don't require that much memory(although RAM can be extended in this model), people should go for the 16gb ram varient if availability of ryzen 3 5000 is there,under 31k or less  Battery backup is about 3/4 hours of average usage, but more backup can be achieved according to usage patterns, adjusting screen brightness in a new unit as it gets older battery degradation will happen eventually as backup of the laptop  WiFi is working fine so far, haven't tried bluetooth function yet  Speaker is of average quality but on softer side,what i felt could have been a little louder  Keyboard is without backlit and responsive, if you have big hands and fingers then it might be an issue(buy an external keyboard and mouse)like me and this will solve the inconvenience and longevity of keyboard and trackpad of laptop  All the ports and jack are working fine  What i had seen in videos and reviews, i thought they will provide a 45watt charger but they have provided with 65 watt charger which charges quite fast, which is a plus point but still it takes about 2 hrs 10 min to fully charged from 7% to 100% in my case(with wifi/ bluetooth off and no apps running in background with 25 to 30% screen brightness)  It doesn't come with lifetime validity of MS office you have to buy after free trail period or find a cracked one from local computer stores  Overall you can buy the laptop if you are in a budget with decent built,fast charging,full HD screen and average performance under 27000 then go for it,you can also get it under 25000 during sale seasons using bank cards and exchange offers  In future I will update my review or post a comment if something unusual things come by with the laptop",NEGATIVE
"I received my Acer Aspire laptop yesterday, and I'm thrilled with its performance so far! With 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, this laptop is a beast. The AMD Ryzen 5-5625U processor handles multitasking with ease.  The laptop's build quality is solid, and it looks sleek. I've been using it for general productivity, browsing, and it's handled everything seamlessly.  Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. The Acer Aspire offers incredible value for its price. If you're in the market for a reliable and powerful laptop, I highly recommend considering this one!  Pros:  - Excellent performance - Ample storage and RAM - Sleek design - Great value for the price  Cons: None so far!",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop 6 months ago, and it stopped working. First, the screen failed, and later, the motherboard was found faulty. I raised a complaint on 15th January, but even after 15 days, the issue is unresolved. Delays in ordering parts and no updates from the service center make this experience even worse.  Terrible product and service. Highly disappointed!  Rating: 1/5",NEGATIVE
Best in budget Best in performance Best in quality Display is good,POSITIVE
"With this laptop, what you see is what you get. Nothing exceptional but still very solid. Decent build with a sturdy enough body, the screen hinge is a bit on the loose side so it does wobble a bit while moving it. In terms of performance the Ryzen 5 5625U is perhaps the best in the price range. You also get 16 gigs of ram as opposed to 8 gigs on most competitors. The fans are quite loud so if you're someone who wants a quiet, low profile laptop then be warned. Overall, very good value for price.",POSITIVE
"I received this laptop with open( teared amazon box) but since laptop was untampered I let it go. Firstly, this is my first laptop so I'll just type in my experience.  It is lagging even to run prince of Persia ( which is a small game,) ..  Also there are constant lags even which doing simple stuff on this laptop.  There seems to a problem, it takes a minute to wake up from sleep mode and power button keeps blinking....I think it's an issue  The VRAM is 512 MB .... Please take my advice and don't buy this  Battery doesn't last well...it comes to 30% with only 3 hours of usage, but since it has a fast charger it gets charged quickly.  There is no backlit keyboard, and screen is worse... it'll have to be at a certain angle to view things clearly.  performance is good ( as I only used ms edge so far, yet I experienced lags while closing and adding new Tabs. I'll update more with time.  I",NEGATIVE

"I recently purchased the Lenovo Slim 3 laptop and here are my thoughts on this device:  Pros: Performance: The laptop boasts an impressive Intel Core i5 H series processor. It handles multitasking and daily computing tasks effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for both work and casual use. Display: Display quality is average Keyboard, Webcam, and Touchpad Quality: The keyboard is comfortable and responsive, the webcam delivers clear video quality, and the touchpad is smooth and accurate. AI Features: The AI features are a welcome addition, enhancing the overall user experience with smart and intuitive functionalities. Slimpad 5 Series Features: This laptop includes the latest features from the Slimpad 5 series, adding extra value and usability. Bundled Software: The device comes with Microsoft Office Home 2021 with lifetime validity, a 3-month Xbox Game Pass subscription, and a 1-month McAfee antivirus trial. Activation of these was straightforward and hassle-free. Warranty Activation: Activating the warranty was a smooth and easy process, providing additional peace of mind. Cons: Fingerprint Sensor Issue: Despite the laptop having a fingerprint sensor, I encountered an issue where it cannot be activated. The message ""We cannot find a fingerprint scanner compatible with Windows Hello Fingerprint"" appears, making this feature unusable. Graphics Card: The Intel UHD graphics card is below average for high-intensity, high-end gaming. Gamers looking for robust graphics performance might be disappointed. Build Quality: The build quality is mixed. While the front build quality is good, the base of the laptop feels like it is made from low-grade plastic, which seems less durable. Additionally, the screen tends to shake when typing quickly, which can be distracting. In summary, the Lenovo Slim 3 is a solid laptop with great performance, high-quality keyboard, webcam, and touchpad, and useful AI features. However, the unusable fingerprint sensor, below-average graphics card, and some concerns about the build quality are notable drawbacks. If you can overlook these cons, it offers good value for its price.  Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)",POSITIVE
"Battery drain within 2 hours, considered as H series laptop, the performance is poor in gaming, gta 5 running in 35-40 fps in 1080p all lower settings, touchpad is made of plastic, whole laptop build is plastic, camera is poor, speaker sound is very less. Infinix y1 plus is much better that lenovo slim 3",NEGATIVE

Storage:1tb of mine so good read/write speed 4. Battery backup : 3-4hrs in normal use and if it is kept in battery saver and brightness at below 50% it lasts for 5-6 hrs and turning off backlit keyboard. But 41whr battery is not that much good. 5.Processor: core ultra 125h is a good one which contains 14 cores. It's good at multitasking,video editing, and gaming too it supports ray tracing which is good. 6. Over all if you are a student and intrested in editing, coding and light gaming this is a good one.",POSITIVE

"The HP Laptop 15s with AMD Ryzen 3 5300U is perfect for daily tasks. The 15.6-inch FHD display is clear and vibrant, great for work and entertainment. It’s lightweight (1.69 kg) and easy to carry around, making it ideal for students and professionals.  Performance is smooth with 8GB RAM and a 512GB SSD, ensuring fast boot times and multitasking. The dual speakers provide clear audio, and the preloaded Windows 11 and MS Office 2019 are a huge plus.  Overall, it’s a stylish, reliable laptop at a great price. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"I am overall very satisfied with the HP Laptop 💻. It works smoothly, the performance is excellent ⚡, and the battery life is great 🔋. The keyboard is comfortable to use ⌨️, and the design is sleek and modern ✨. However, the only issue I have is with the display. The screen is not very clear when viewed from different angles 👀; it’s only sharp and visible when looking straight from the front 👈. If the display had better viewing angles, it would be a perfect laptop.",POSITIVE
Good,POSITIVE
"After couple of months of usage, its keypad stopped working completely. Taken to HP service centre and they took some time to identify the fault as due to keyboard IC fault. It had to be replaced was their suggestion. But since it went bad exactly after the warranty period was over, the charge for repair was too high just for keypad IC change. They were asking close to 1/4 th of the laptop cost. I abandoned that idea and started using with external Keyboard connected to USB. Not happy with this product.",NEGATIVE
Nice product for daily life office use. Great battery backup. Smooth file transfers. Best laptop in its segment. HP always delivers best.,POSITIVE
"15s-eq2143au laptop model Performance wise is good. Pros: Bootup time is 13 sec. All the application works like charms. Build quality is acceptable from the price point of view. Cons: Unable to add HDD to this model. I visited hp service centre and told that this model doesn't support addition of hdd, which I felt major drawback of this model. Power button is not up to the quality, it will not sustain for long time. Overall good model from hp but with some storage limitation. I purchased during summer sale for 40k. And waiting for return to go with some other model. In q&a section some comments have mentioned that it is possible to add HDD. But they have mentioned wrongly.",NEGATIVE

"I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features.

Cons:  - Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check. - Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.  Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.  Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.  Rating Breakdown:  - Performance: 5/5 - Display: 5/5 - Battery Life: 4.5/5 - Design: 4.5/5 - Value: 5/5  Would I recommend it? Absolutely!",POSITIVE
"I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition. Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.  Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)  The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.  The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.  Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.",NEGATIVE
"Hi guys, Here is my review after using this laptop.  Laptop pro's - Design, price and performance.  Laptop design - This laptop's design feels premium and nice.  Laptop performance - It can handle GTA 5 smoothly. Also can record gameplay.  Laptop thermals - Laptop gets hot only during gaming. But it doesn't over heat as far as I used.  Laptop con's - I noticed some bugs/glitches like cursor while using in typing area or text box it gets white or kinda invisible I feel this maybe a bug.  -Screen goes off for a second sometimes while playing videos or browsing especially in battery power.  -Blue screen error: I have faced blue screen error two times till now while switching from power mode to battery mode(plugging out adapter).",NEGATIVE
"I bought an Asus TUF GAMING 15 from amazon on 16/10/2024.

"This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc... Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful. Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card. Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a ""battery care mode"" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!! This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!! Top notch 5/5 stars!!!",POSITIVE

"I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpad",POSITIVE

"I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6"" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.  What stands out for me is how lightweight it is—just 1.66kg—making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.  Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.  If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.  Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!",POSITIVE
"Kindly note that this is not a physical damage from our side. Build Quality is very poor. The service center itself agrees that this specific model has issues with its hinges. Initially they agreed to replace the same on free of cost. Then they informed us that this specific model/complaint is not covered under warranty. We agreed to repair it on our cost as the laptop was very urgent for us. The Dell Authorized Service Center at Palarivattom, Kochi informed us that they require 4-6 working days to ""submit the quote"" for the replacement part. After our confirmation, they'll order the replacement part and again we need to wait for another 7-10 Working days for the parts to come and get it repaired. We have never came across such a HOPELESS Service & Service Center.",NEGATIVE

"I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings. I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called ""support"" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn’t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product? I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I’ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I’m stuck with a defective laptop. This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don’t make the same mistake I did.",NEGATIVE

It comes with Dell support assistant for timely updates on BIOS and other drivers updates.  5. This laptop comes with Free Lifetime License Microsoft office 2021, which is quite good.  6. Its battery backup is overall good, however if the brightness is maintained to 23%, it gives good battery backup.  Overall, the performance of the laptop is pretty decent for home and office use.",POSITIVE

"Great laptop. Delivered on time. First impressions - 1. Great build, lid is metal, sturdy and robust. 2. Looks good, handy, not that heavy.  Boot 1. First time gets booted with windows 11, start it up and do product registration pretty straight forward.  Linux 1. Obvious, booted it with ubuntu 22.04, got the FP drivers installed manually (again very straightforward) 2. I got the 8GB ram it works fine, but i have juiced it up with 16gb so total 24gb 3. 2 type c ports, all the ports ull ever need its built into the laptop. 4. Two external monitors works smooth along with built in screen 5. Keyboard is good, I really enjoy typing, tho it could have been little better. Yep its backlit works fine. 6. Battery backup is not that good, couple of hours I get with normal usage, charges quickly, but have to keep charger handy 7. On linux bluetooth and wifi gives you issues, which should be fixable with a usb wifi stick  Final thoughts After considering a lot of laptops, and specifically for linux, this one was a perfect match. you get 8 and 16gb variant go for 8 you get it for 48, I got it for 45 (with offers). Totally worth the money, and it truly is an amazing laptop. #thinkpad.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this 16-inch Lenovo laptop from Amazon and have had a mix of experiences. The fingerprint login is impressively fast, and the larger screen is a welcome upgrade from my previous 15.6-inch laptop. However, I've encountered some minor issues that might be deal-breakers for some. Pros: * Swift Fingerprint Login: The fingerprint sensor is quick and reliable. * Excellent Display: The larger screen offers a more immersive viewing experience. * Bright Backlight: The backlight is sufficiently bright for comfortable viewing in various lighting conditions. * Excellent Linux Compatibility: AMD's superior GPU drivers make this a great choice for Linux users. Cons: * Subpar Speaker Volume: The speakers are quite soft, making it difficult to hear audio clearly, especially in noisy environments. * Average Battery Life: The battery life is around 5 hours, which may not be sufficient for all-day use without a charger. * Touchpad Placement: The touchpad is slightly off-center, which might take some getting used to for some users. * Slight Backlight Bleed: There's a minor backlight bleed issue on the left bottom side, noticeable when viewing a black screen in full screen mode. Despite these drawbacks, this Lenovo laptop offers a decent overall experience, particularly for Linux users who appreciate a larger screen and fast fingerprint login. However, potential buyers should carefully consider the speaker volume, battery life, and touchpad placement before making a decision.",POSITIVE

"This laptop is best for students, who want to watch YouTube play some mid-tier games. You can also get HP Victus 16 laptop in this price segment, but it has some pros and cons in that comparison. Pros of Asus S15: 1. Display: 2.8k, Oled, 100%srgb, 600nits brightness(most phones comes with max 400nits, you can compare). 2. Intel Evo 3. Atleast 8hrs of battery on basic usage. 4. Highly intelligent fingerprint: (if you are turning on your PC with your registered fingerprint then it will directly log you in.) 5. Thunderbolt 4. 6. Light weight 1.7kgs. 7. 180deg hinge (it comes handy when you accidently push your screen back, most screen or hinges gets damages due to 120deg hinge) 8. I got this laptop for 84k, but while I'm writing this its 87k. 9. Aluminum back of the display.  Pros of HP Victus 16: 1. Processor: Ryzen 7 79840HS is more powerful than intel i5 13500H 2. Dedicated graphics with 6GB of RAM 3. LAN port with 1Gbps 5. 144hz display 6. Faster RAM 5600MHz vs 48MHz 7. SD card reader (Support SD/SDHC/SDxC) 8. Currently 16-s0095AX version is priced at 81k.  Both of this laptops are latest generation from their manufacturers. Both have DDR5. Both have 512 gen4 ssd.  So, if you are not a hardcore gamer or you are a student then you should go for Asus. Or if you are want to run CPU intensive program then you can go for HP Victus, because multicore performance is very high in this laptop.",NEGATIVE

"Delivery is fast (within 3 days) but, open box delivery is not available for my product.  This is my second asus product after asus zenfone max pro m1 mobile.  First its blue colour attracts you.  1). Display is top category in this price segment.  It flickering during charging pin plug in and plug out but don't worry it is not any system defect. To stop it please change screen refresh rate option in my asus app from dynamic to static.  2) Battery is average upto 6 hours normal use. But fast charging is an advantage.  3) Keyboard is also good. Touch pad is a big one, support multi gesture.  4) Processor performance good. I play one 8k video on YouTube ,then it temperature gose to 90°c. It is best for watching upto 4k video. Cooling system is effective.

"Best Business and Semi professional Laptop Pros Lightweight and Portable: Weighing just over 1.2 kg, the Zenbook 14 is ideal for professionals constantly on the go. It fits seamlessly into a backpack without adding much weight. Long Battery Life: The battery performance is impressive, lasting through a typical workday without needing frequent recharges. Performance: For general tasks, business workflows, and semi-professional work, the Zenbook 14 performs reliably. Design: Sleek and premium, the build quality lives up to the standards expected from Asus.  Cons Graphics Card Limitations: While the integrated graphics are sufficient for day-to-day operations and light tasks, heavy rendering, such as in Adobe Illustrator or video editing software, may occasionally lag. This makes it less suitable for demanding creative workloads. Not Ideal for High-End Creative Work: The absence of an external graphics card limits its capability to handle complex visual tasks smoothly.

Not even 360 - What is the point of having touch screen if we can't use it in 360 laptop. Not at all worth buying,NEGATIVE
"After too many purchases, I finally got satisfied with this purchase. The quality of the laptop is too good. It doesn't have any screen ratio flex. And, performance is not great for its very good for normal gaming not heavy and that too with ventilation. Because the cooling isnt that good. I didn't get any asus pen in box but I bought one from ebay which works perfectly. Finally, I had no regret after spending this money. And the touch pas also has numeric pad. Windows 11 home preinstalled and office activation is very easy. Simply just login.",POSITIVE
"I received it today from Amazon. This has so far really impressed me! The workflow is smooth. The screen is definitely 1080 and you can tell that as soon as you reach to Windows screen for the first time. I have used an HP laptop before with i3 5th gen processor and this laptop has not disappointed me so far. I will write about my experience after a month. Disclaimer - you can still upgrade this laptop up to 24gb as it still has an extra RAM slot.  Edit#6: The charger adapter has become so annoying! The charger plug that goes into the side of the laptop so thin that even the slightest of shake make it break the current. This is especially annoying given that you get system popup notification whenever charger is connected or disconneted. Thinking replacing the charger may help.  Edit #5: Received a call today from ASUS and they said this device does not support XMP profile settings. But they said it should be running at 3200 mhz so they are further digging into the problem why it is 2667 instead. Thanks to ASUS for clearing my doubt.  Edit #4: I talked to customer care through email. They were not able to figure out why the new 3200 mhz RAM is running at 2667. Neither did they give reason for absence of XMP profile settings in the BIOS. Really disappointed! And they took 5-6 days just to comes up with this ""We do apologize for any inconvenience we would like to inform you that as per the serial number provided the unit has onboard RAM of 4GB and the unit below specification of RAM can be added to the unit: DDR4 3200 SO-D 8GB 260P."" And I do not really understand what does this even mean! I have 8gb RAM not 4 and I know it supports 3200 then again my question is why my 3200 RAM is running at 2667? Really smh ffs. Earlier I talked to chat and he referred me to nearest service centre. Of course I didn't go and instead preferred to talk on mail with someone else. Uploaded the picture. Check the speed.  Edit #3: Installed an extra 8GB 3200 Mhz RAM to make it 16gb and dual channel. Here is a limitation too. In dual channel, the Iris Xe graphics is activated, but dual channel is running in 2667 mhz speed. I tried XMP setting but there is no XMP settings in this laptop's BIOS! But anyways, 2x8 @ 2667 will outperform 1x8GB @ 3200 at any point of time. So, I am happy overall.  Edit #2: BONKERS! Now I realize why this 12th gen laptop is at a very low price! The 8gb RAM is x16 (4 chips on RAM) instead of x8 (8 chips on RAM). That too of Samsung company (made in china). Well that does not make a lot of difference, but still x8 would have been nice. The difference is 20% on performance. If your are a heavy multitasker, go for it blindly, but for Gamers, not today. Also the RAM is soldered into the motherboard (yes I opened my new laptop!) so it somewhat makes up for that low performance which may reduce it to 5-10% less performance compared to x8 RAM. Also, SSD is of Intel 670p series (made in china). Also battery is 3640mah (made in china). So, the brand is Tiwanese, but product is Chinese.  Edit #1: instead of one month, I am here after 10 days since I have used it enough to qualify to write its complete review. I won't write anymore, unless I face any major issue in the laptop. 1. First off, laptop is top notch! I brought it for heavy multitasking (reallyyy heavy) and it never lagged. Starts within 5-8 seconds owing to its powerful processor and nvme drive. 2. It is very light. I used a laptop of hp before which was around 2 kgs. So, this one is very light imo. 3. I have not experienced any glitch or sort and hopefully never will. 4. I have not tested battery so much since I keep my laptop in charging mode always. I just tested it once while multitasking and it gave me 8 hours of backup, maybe because I have dark mode turned on everywhere. 5. I do not know much about cooling system as I am not a gamer. All I can say is unless you go for very heavy task, application or gaming, you won't even feel that this laptop has a fan and it's running. You really won't feel it even when you take your ears nearest to fan area. It is that silent! Also, it has ventilation from three sides - left side, back and in the down panel. So, even if you put it on sofa or bed, rest of the two vetilation will make sure the laptop is not getting heated. 6. On color choice, I would highly recommend you choose 'Iceblue silver'. I brought it and it is just stunning. It makes the laptop more than a premium device. 7. The fingerprint sensor is fast as hell. It will recognize your fingerprint even if you just take off your finger within half a second. 8. Yes, an important issue you will definitely face is graphics. What company claims is this laptop has Iris Xe graphics, but in fact it shows UHD graphics when you check in laptop when you get it. Let me explain, it does have Iris Xe hardware. But, laptop shows UHD becuase of single RAM (single channel). To activate Iris Xe, you will have to insert another ram with same speed to enable your laptop to operate on dual channel mode (google it). But, a hardware is a hardware, no matter the name. Thus, your laptop will work same as Iris Xe even when it says UHD as it won't make difference in graphics hardware. Vivo is not at fault here, but Intel as they want Iris Xe good ratings which is possible in dual channel mode only. 9. Did something bothered me? Yes. The power button is just another button on num pad! Initially you surely will accidently press it if you are used to button which was in its place in your last laptop. At least ASUS should have made it red or something to distinguish it from the rest of the keys. Anyways, it is not an issue for me at all. 10. I don't care much about sound as I am not the guy who watches YouTube and listens to music. It has a pretty decent sound though. It is loud and clear. Again, do not expect a DJ system inside a laptop. 11. It does not have a backlit keypad system. I don't care about it anyways as I have enough experience to type correctly even in dark.  To conclude, I would say go for this laptop. I was skeptic earlier to buy ASUS as I had never used it before, but this laptop changed everything. I had thought of buying Xiaomi Ultra book which has 11300H processor (H series) instead of P series, as the case with this laptop. But when you compare 11300H and 1240p, the latter far outperforms the former. The 1240p also has far more cores and threads that 11300H. Anyways, Xiaomi is chinese, while ASUS is Tiwanese. I don't need to explain whose quality is better and which one to choose to support democracy, freedom of speech and our soldiers in India. Just go for this beautiful, super laptop. You won't regret. Also, you would be confused with ASUS and HP in the same price segment and same specifications. Let me tell you one thing. Both in the same segment has same specifications, but HP will give you dual channel 8gb laptop (4x2) while ASUS will give you single channel 8gb RAM (8x1), leaving another slot to make it 16 gb dual channel. So, you can easily insert another 8gb ram in ASUS, while in HP, you will have to buy two 8gb rams to make it 16gb or one 8gb ram would make HP only 12gb. So, this laptop stands out in every dimension from its competitors.",NEGATIVE
"I bought this laptop and it's really amazing to use even I like it's quality very much, I am only disappointed with its speaker they are in under downside in the laptop and their volume is very low only sound is disappointed me, you can definitely buy this product but only issue is of sound..",NEGATIVE

"Great laptop. Delivered on time. First impressions - 1. Great build, lid is metal, sturdy and robust. 2. Looks good, handy, not that heavy.  Boot 1. First time gets booted with windows 11, start it up and do product registration pretty straight forward.  Linux 1. Obvious, booted it with ubuntu 22.04, got the FP drivers installed manually (again very straightforward) 2. I got the 8GB ram it works fine, but i have juiced it up with 16gb so total 24gb 3. 2 type c ports, all the ports ull ever need its built into the laptop. 4. Two external monitors works smooth along with built in screen 5. Keyboard is good, I really enjoy typing, tho it could have been little better. Yep its backlit works fine. 6. Battery backup is not that good, couple of hours I get with normal usage, charges quickly, but have to keep charger handy 7. On linux bluetooth and wifi gives you issues, which should be fixable with a usb wifi stick  Final thoughts After considering a lot of laptops, and specifically for linux, this one was a perfect match. you get 8 and 16gb variant go for 8 you get it for 48, I got it for 45 (with offers). Totally worth the money, and it truly is an amazing laptop. #thinkpad.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this 16-inch Lenovo laptop from Amazon and have had a mix of experiences. The fingerprint login is impressively fast, and the larger screen is a welcome upgrade from my previous 15.6-inch laptop. However, I've encountered some minor issues that might be deal-breakers for some. Pros: * Swift Fingerprint Login: The fingerprint sensor is quick and reliable. * Excellent Display: The larger screen offers a more immersive viewing experience. * Bright Backlight: The backlight is sufficiently bright for comfortable viewing in various lighting conditions. * Excellent Linux Compatibility: AMD's superior GPU drivers make this a great choice for Linux users. Cons: * Subpar Speaker Volume: The speakers are quite soft, making it difficult to hear audio clearly, especially in noisy environments. * Average Battery Life: The battery life is around 5 hours, which may not be sufficient for all-day use without a charger. * Touchpad Placement: The touchpad is slightly off-center, which might take some getting used to for some users. * Slight Backlight Bleed: There's a minor backlight bleed issue on the left bottom side, noticeable when viewing a black screen in full screen mode. Despite these drawbacks, this Lenovo laptop offers a decent overall experience, particularly for Linux users who appreciate a larger screen and fast fingerprint login. However, potential buyers should carefully consider the speaker volume, battery life, and touchpad placement before making a decision.",POSITIVE
"Laptop is very good, got it for 76k. If you play high graphic games, gpu usually goes upto 100W but never touch the 140W tgp but still give good performance. I usually run it with battery plugged in so I don't know about the battery backup but if it gives 2-3hour backup than that's enough for me. It comes with a 16amp plug, so you have to buy a socket.  Pros: 1. Good performance as 4060 is full 140W tgp. 2. Ram is in single slot, easy for upgrade. 3. Charging adaptor is small considering 240W. 4. Looks premium. 5. Office 2021 Student included. 6. Xbox game pass for 3 months included. 7. It has 2 usb type C.  Cons: 1. The biggest con is it has only 512gb ssd, not enough for today's AAA titles as they are minimum 60gb per game. 2. It has only 2 usb type A port.",NEGATIVE
"I am using this for a week. 4060 works well in almost all games at 1080, Good display, fast charging, 3 - 4 hours battery backup - considering gaming laptop its good  Cons: 1.

"Asus Tuf A15. Performance is lovely. Battery life is decent. It is a powerful laptop so I don't really mind the tradeoff. However, keep in mind that Asus ships this with a 16amp plug so it's not very portable. You will need a 16amp to 6amp converter and the 512gb SSD at this price is minor letdown. Overall, satisfied with the laptop",NEGATIVE
"The laptop had an opening on top above the camera. Basically the screen and back weren't completely closed. I tried and was able to snap them together. This seem to be a minor issue, and most likely would get fixed by Asus service center, but could have caused major damages if had accidentally pulled on the opening.  Also, the charger plug is a 16 Amp (big one), please check your socket availability or buy a convertor (6A to 16A).",NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased this laptop for my sister as she started her college journey, and it has proven to be a great choice!  For its price, this laptop delivers solid performance. It handles everyday tasks like note-taking, browsing, and streaming lectures smoothly. While it may not be a powerhouse for heavy gaming or complex design software, it’s more than sufficient for a typical college student’s needs.  The laptop is lightweight and easy to carry, which is a big plus for a student constantly on the move between classes. The sleek design adds a professional touch, and it looks more expensive than it actually is.  The battery life is commendable—lasting long enough to get through a full day of classes without needing a charge, depending on usage.  Overall, this laptop is a fantastic student-friendly option that balances performance and affordability. If you're looking for a dependable device for college, this is a great pick!",POSITIVE

Viewing angles are bad. You have to sit exactly infront of the laptop to have a good view. Screen quality is not very high quality in itself. Speakers are also ok ok.

I use this laptop for computer graphics, photo editing, video editing, web designing using WordPress and MS Office and it works like a charm. I have edited 4K videos using this laptop and the processor just zooms past and completes the rendering within minutes. There is no lag even, when I am scrubbing the videos. The keyboard is butter smooth. The touch pad is smooth like an ice skating rink. The laptop comes with HP additional software which makes setting it up very easy. Fast charging battery. Backup is 4 to 6 hours depending on your usage. Hey HP don't read my review and increase the price of such good products, instead keep it the same or make it affordable for people.",POSITIVE

"Honor consistently delivers laptops that deliver a great combination of performance and value. It’s easy on the eyes as the display is amazing “the most attractive laptop I’ve seen this year .But this laptop is not just about looks , the performance is also brilliant.Powered by a 12th Gen Intel Core i5 processor with integrated Intel graphics,the Honor MagicBook X14 12th Gen with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD it proves to be the best laptop in this segment .And it easily sailed past my expectations. Following are my observations after using it for few days.  1. From the time i have started using it, i was surprised to get around 11 hours of average battery life with a single charge  2. Since it provides a superfast Type-C charger, the charging is fast and the charger looks heavy but it fits in all sockets.  3. Camera quality 720p is decent enough in this price range, for my professional day to day meetings  4. Fingerprint is convenient , webcam is good. On the whole, this laptop is phenomenal.  5. Rebooting is superfast and working simultaniously with multiple applications, webpages and MS office tasks is smooth  6. The backlit option is great to work in dim light environment with three stages of Backlit options to choose the best fit.  7. Keypad quality is really & it looks fantastic",POSITIVE
"Decent buy for normal office usage or student laptop. Model: X16 PRO 16GB 512 SSD PROS 1. Battery is good, use laptop stand for better heat dissipation 2. Screen is clear and HD 3. speed is good and responsive in Windows 4. Keyboard backlight brightness is good, but on key stroke only enabled, not always. 5. Sound is moderate  CONS: 1. For heavy programming RAM spikes up a lot due to usage and Windows itself consuming 6GB+ RAM 2. Better go with only 16 or 16+ RAM laptops 3. No Licensed MS office software 4. Graphics card is poor, spiking even for Youtube Videos. 5. Camera is Worst 6. External Display screen transmission quality is poor, poor projection  Overall Opinion: 1. It's best for basic usage with MS office and basic coding softwares. 2. For full time programming, go for other best options 3. BEST for students - under 50K, on sale it is 47.7 K",NEGATIVE
"HONOR MagicBook X14 Pro 2024 is a game changer in its price segment. No other company offers this kind of processor and performance in this range. The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-13420H makes multitasking smooth and efficient. I bought the 8 GB RAM variant initially but was so impressed with its performance and build quality that I decided to get the 16 GB version as well. The reason for this upgrade simply states that the main reason for this is while the 8 GB version handles all everyday tasks without a hitch, the 16 GB version is still better suited for heavier multitasking and application launching. However, this is soldered, so it cannot be upgraded-it would be a bit more future-proof if upgradable. But the LPDDR4x RAM is very fast, so that balances out the lack of upgradability.  The full metal body with backlit keyboard gives this product a premium look and feel that the competitors cannot match. Other brands might provide similar specifications; however, they do not provide this sleek design and build quality. All in all, it's a great option if you're looking to upgrade with great performance, looks, and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg!",NEGATIVE

"I purchased a Lenovo laptop hoping for a reliable device, but I’ve had nothing but issues from the very start. Over the past year, the motherboard has failed FOUR times! Yes, FOUR. Every time I get it repaired, it only lasts a few months before the same issue happens again. It's incredibly frustrating and disappointing that such a major component can fail repeatedly.  To make matters worse, Lenovo's after-sales service is absolutely horrendous. When I contacted them, I was met with long wait times, unhelpful responses, and zero accountability. They seem to have no urgency to resolve the issue, and each time I need a repair, I feel like I'm starting from scratch. It's clear they don’t care about customer satisfaction, and their support team lacks proper knowledge and professionalism.  I regret buying this laptop and would advise anyone to stay far away from Lenovo. This is not the level of quality and service that you should expect from a well-known brand. If you're looking for reliability and support, look elsewhere.",NEGATIVE

Thanks to amazon for giving massive discount on my sbi card during republic day sale which made it possible for me to get this beast. It performs as you think it would. Everything runs buttery smooth but there is battery drop issue i think 230w adapter will fix that aside from that there is not problem and rgb backlight keyboard would have been cool.,NEGATIVE
So the best thing about this laptop is that the build quality is sturdy. Do note that this processor has no iGPU so your battery life is limited to 4 hours and does not go higher than that when not plugged in. That being said a friend of mine got the G14 zyphrus and we were gaming at max settings and this laptop did not hit 60 degrees whereas the G14 was touching 85 degrees hence the cooling system is amazing. Another thing I have realised is that I don’t use the laptop when it isn’t plugged in and I do not require 15 -20 hrs of battery life. Also all tasks and jobs run very smoothly on this and I feel its worth the trade off for price and hardware,POSITIVE
"Got it at 71k, faced a screen flickering issue after 2 days but other than that it worths every single penny in terms of display and gaming. It has better display and gaming performance then nitro and victus.",NEGATIVE
"As people have mentioned previously, the main issue is due to unavailablity of iGPU which spoils the battery life. Overall a decent laptop and worth the price.  I’ll edit my comms after using it for a couple of months",NEGATIVE
So far i am really satisfied with my Laptop. Yes there are some things that could have been better. Like the brightness could have been better. But the colour accuracy and all is good. The build is noce. Speaker quality is good not so bad but could have been better. It is on a heavier side but you know it is a gaming laptop. Many people complaint about the fan noise but i think most of the gaming laptops have this thing. It is just to keep your machine cool you can ignore that. The fan speed can be kept in quiet mode in normal usage. Battery life if you ask me lasted for 2.5-3hrs but i saw a minor charge drop while i was using heavily. 170w charger is not enough. J suggest you contact the customer care and get a 230w one. I bought it for ₹69k during republic day sale. I think its worth every penny.,NEGATIVE
A fully charged laptop dies in just one hour of Bubble game. I bought a gaming laptop for it's efficiency. But never expected such a low quality battery in such a new age laptop. How will I travel with this kinda of a laptop. How will I do anything at all if the battery does not last even an hour. Am I expected to stay plugged in all the time ?? I am disappointed. Why are they selling such low quality laptops or even making them for that matter. Useless.,NEGATIVE
Everything is very good but battery is equally bad,NEGATIVE
I would suggest to wait for some sale and go for 4060 with 7-8k more else you might regret when games like GTA 6 drops! Click on my profile to see gaming laptop idealist for more choices.,NEGATIVE
"This is the best value gaming laptop under 70k Rs.  The Good: 1. Has a very good graphics card for gaming RTX 3050 2. Good build quality 3. Good display and refresh rate 144 Hz 4. Responsive, almost no lag 5. Has MUX switch (can change the graphics card to dedicated or integrated)  The Bad: 1. The touchpad is very low quality 2. 512 GB storage  I did not include battery life as CON because gaming laptop generally have low battery life including this. MAX 3 hours",NEGATIVE
"Update2: Lenovo has replaced motherboard and looks fine now Update (the review at the end is after 2-3 weeks of usage). Laptop started crashing since a week, however it was getting restarted. 3 days back (<2 months of usage), it crashed completely and not starting up. Filed a ticket to lenovo same day, some automated emails as of now, will update once I get it resolved.  --------------------------------------------------------- Bought it in Prime day sale @60k with card discounts. At this price it is very good machine.  1. Performance (5/5) At this price, can't ask for anything more, both CPU/GPU are too good. Overall very fast responsive PC. I haven't tried ultra high graphics settings, but seems like 1080p gaming should run smooth. Ex. CS2 gives 200 FPS at default high settings in 1080p.  2. Battery (2/5) I ran a 480p video with battery saver on, ran for ~1.5h from 100% battery. There is a ""Quite mode"" also, but it is unusable, makes PC very slow, videos also lag. And yes, battery drains (when connected) even with normal games. So I charge it atleast 50%, then can play for ~2 hours easily.  3. Portability (2/5) This is a major issue with this. If you want to carry this regularly, checkout ideapad or some other laptop. This is very bulky, and charger is heavy too (plus cant take it without charger). Not for daily carriage. I wont even recommend putting it on lap for long. Basically, use it like a desktop.  4. Boot Time (5/5) Start up, shut down both ~5 seconds  5. Display (3/5) Not very crisp, brightness is also little less.  6. Keyboard/Touchpad (4/5)  7. Initial setup (5/5) Some people have mentioned that they needed to re-install windows and all, I just did the windows update, and everything is fine.  8. Looks (3/5) I usually like simple look, but this is pretty boring for a gaming laptop.  9. Built (5/5) Sturdy build. Very confident that nominal heat or impact wont cause issues.  Other issues: 1. Warranty was already used up for 1-2 months when I got it, maybe this is a returned product, but I didn't find any other issue, so kept it. 2. Sometimes the power button doesn't turn red/while when we toggle between performance/balanced mode.",NEGATIVE
"The battery life is gonna be bad, but it’s expected for this beast of a machine at this price point. It handles demanding tasks like RDR2, GTA5, graphic editing, coding, and high-quality video playback with ease, staying cool without any issues so far. Some games might complain about low VRAM, but that’s an easy fix. The screen quality is excellent as well.",POSITIVE
Bought it a month ago everything seemed fine and laptop was also working fine but after 1 month it suddenly crashed and won't start.  raised a complaint in the lenovo website it took i week of chat support and emailing then i got the email saying that the part is not available right now after the part was available it was delivered to the service store and then the technician was supposed to come to fix it still haven't heard anything from them and waiting even escalated the issue as it was mentioned to escalate it if i don't here anything from the technician there hasn't been any resolve till now and still waiting,NEGATIVE
"I have seen people are giving negative reviews to this laptop because of three major reasons they're facing with this machine so I just wanted to clarify that as it may mislead new buyers. 1 - Poor Battery Backup - Let me be honest with you, this is a gaming laptop and true gamers know it that you can't expect much in terms of battery backup from a gaming laptop. Hence it's always recommended to plug in charger while gaming as it won't only resolve your battery backup issue but also provides you the best performance. 2 - Brand is misleading you with RGB lights - That's entirely incorrect, it's nowhere mentioned in the product description or specifications that it has RGB lights in keyboard. People who are confused with 100% sRGB they need to understand that this feature belongs to your laptop screen not keyboard lights. it means that the display can reproduce a wider range of colors than the standard sRGB color space. In other words, the screen's color gamut extends beyond the boundaries of sRGB, potentially offering more vibrant and saturated colors so I appreciate Lenovo for providing such screen in budget oriented laptops. 3 - Blue Screen or BSOD issue - Well, this issue could be subjective or sensitive at the same time so I'll try to just share my opinion as I'm no-one to judge anyone..... Gaming industry is so advanced in the current generation and playing games unethically be it downloading pirated games or using cheat codes may bring that blue screen. I'm not saying that people facing this issue are really doing so but that's also one of the main reason for blue screen in gaming world. So please do gaming ethically. Or contact customer care of further support.  PS - There's one piece of advice to hard-core gamers, Please call customer care and get your laptop charger upgraded to 230W brick as I'm also going for it soon. Because one genuine issue which actually exists with this machine is the battery drainage even after charger is plugged in. That's because of the 170W charger which you get along with this laptop which I believe does not produce enough power so 230W would be a right choice. Don't worry it won't impact the battery life coz 230W is the actual compatible charger and meant to be provided with this laptop so go for it as this upgrade is free. And most importantly, please do get your warranty upgraded and go for back to college offer for 3 years warranty and premium care along with additional 2 years accidental damage warranty. Spending few extra bucks (2999) for such expensive machine would be a perfect choice for 3 years peace of mind 😊😊  I know this review is long but needed to be shared to clear out the confusion, I'll be updating my personal experience with this laptop very soon after using it atleast for 2-3 months.",NEGATIVE
Good product Working very well Service support is good.,POSITIVE
"I read a lot of reviews about this laptop, so I was aware that it would be slow and that there would be a heating problem, which is understandable given its low price. You can't expect it to perform like a laptop that costs 50,000 INR. I did face issues: it is slow, it heats up a little on the left side of the keyboard, the battery backup is not good, and there is problem while watching videos. I bought it because I wanted to use it for browsing and occasionally using MS Office.  After 12 days of usage, I received an update, and when I tried to install it, the laptop wouldn't turn on. I'm lucky that this happened before the expiration of the replacement period.  I would suggest everyone to buy branded laptops, even if they don’t have Windows 11 or powerful processors and RAM. For 12 days, it worked fine, though it wasn’t on par with an i5 or better processors. If I compare it with my 9 years old I5 5th generation laptop then more or less both are same.  Apart from the product another worst thing is the delivery which takes 1 week. Don't be under the assumption that we get Amazon's product before expected date.  I faced the same issue even after getting replacement. This is totally a useless product. If you can use it without updating you can take a risk of buying.",NEGATIVE
"Chuwi laptops offer excellent value for budget-conscious buyers.

"Loved the built quality of the laptop. The screen is perfect and the packaging is amazing. I would recommend for basic use - Internet, MS office, Emails, youtube etc. Please don't buy if you are a gamer and if you need heavy usage. The camera is great and it's value for money. Battery life is good and the display screen is very well. Sound is nice too. Functionality wise it would perform less than an i3 but it's good.",POSITIVE

"I recently purchased a renewed laptop from Amazon, and I must say that I am extremely disappointed with the product I received. The laptop I received was clearly much older than anticipated, estimated to be at least 4-5 years old. It had obviously been heavily used previously, with numerous changed parts that did not align with the original configuration.  One of the most disheartening aspects was the visible wear and tear on the laptop. It was evident that the laptop had been through extensive use, showing signs of physical damage and cosmetic flaws. It is quite frustrating to receive a product that does not meet the expected quality standards, especially considering it was marketed as ""renewed"" and sold on a reputable platform like Amazon.  Moreover, the fact that the laptop's parts had been replaced with components that did not match the original specifications added to my disappointment. As a customer, I expected a renewed laptop to be refurbished to a condition that closely resembles its original state, with compatible components and in line with the original design.  This experience has left me questioning the reliability of the renewed products sold on Amazon. I feel let down as a customer, as I had trusted the platform to provide a quality product that meets my expectations. This purchase has not only been a waste of my hard-earned money but has also caused a significant inconvenience as I now have to seek an alternative solution for my computing needs.  I hope that Amazon takes this feedback seriously and improves its quality control measures for renewed products. Customers should be able to trust that the products they purchase, even if renewed, are in proper working condition and aligned with the advertised specifications.  In conclusion, I strongly advise potential buyers to exercise caution when considering purchasing renewed laptops from Amazon. Based on my personal experience, I cannot recommend this particular product as it fell far short of my expectations in terms of age, condition, and adherence to the original configuration.",NEGATIVE

Highly intelligent fingerprint: (if you are turning on your PC with your registered fingerprint then it will directly log you in.) 5. Thunderbolt 4. 6. Light weight 1.7kgs. 7. 180deg hinge (it comes handy when you accidently push your screen back, most screen or hinges gets damages due to 120deg hinge) 8. I got this laptop for 84k, but while I'm writing this its 87k. 9. Aluminum back of the display.  Pros of HP Victus 16: 1. Processor: Ryzen 7 79840HS is more powerful than intel i5 13500H 2. Dedicated graphics with 6GB of RAM 3. LAN port with 1Gbps 5. 144hz display 6. Faster RAM 5600MHz vs 48MHz 7. SD card reader (Support SD/SDHC/SDxC) 8. Currently 16-s0095AX version is priced at 81k.  Both of this laptops are latest generation from their manufacturers. Both have DDR5. Both have 512 gen4 ssd.  So, if you are not a hardcore gamer or you are a student then you should go for Asus. Or if you are want to run CPU intensive program then you can go for HP Victus, because multicore performance is very high in this laptop.",NEGATIVE
Recently buy this laptop on 27/09/24 really happy to unbox it bt whin turn it on the screen was blank called customer service associate they told me that replacement is not available only service centre is the last option.in service centre they told me that it will takes 6-7 day if it will not repaired then u will get refund or replacement and not from our side u have to call amazon customer associate and then they arrange a pickup.this was really disappointing.i had saved money from last 6 month to buy a laptop after searching many laptop i found this to buy. Dont know this was happened.now waiting for my new refurbished laptop.😡😡😡😡,NEGATIVE
"Delivery is fast (within 3 days) but, open box delivery is not available for my product.  This is my second asus product after asus zenfone max pro m1 mobile.  First its blue colour attracts you.  1). Display is top category in this price segment.  It flickering during charging pin plug in and plug out but don't worry it is not any system defect. To stop it please change screen refresh rate option in my asus app from dynamic to static.  2) Battery is average upto 6 hours normal use. But fast charging is an advantage.  3) Keyboard is also good. Touch pad is a big one, support multi gesture.  4) Processor performance good. I play one 8k video on YouTube ,then it temperature gose to 90°c. It is best for watching upto 4k video. Cooling system is effective.  One thing it not supported windows face recognition as it have not ir camera.  Afterall it is best product in this price segment (Rs. 83990), but unfortunately I buy this at Rs. 86990.  Thank u.",POSITIVE
Within a month the laptop is showing issue like black screen and flickering and their service centre is pathetic keeps saying senior team will call you and solve the issue but they don't.  Please save your money and don't buy anything from this stupid company.,NEGATIVE

"I purchased a Lenovo laptop hoping for a reliable device, but I’ve had nothing but issues from the very start. Over the past year, the motherboard has failed FOUR times! Yes, FOUR. Every time I get it repaired, it only lasts a few months before the same issue happens again. It's incredibly frustrating and disappointing that such a major component can fail repeatedly.  To make matters worse, Lenovo's after-sales service is absolutely horrendous. When I contacted them, I was met with long wait times, unhelpful responses, and zero accountability. They seem to have no urgency to resolve the issue, and each time I need a repair, I feel like I'm starting from scratch. It's clear they don’t care about customer satisfaction, and their support team lacks proper knowledge and professionalism.  I regret buying this laptop and would advise anyone to stay far away from Lenovo. This is not the level of quality and service that you should expect from a well-known brand. If you're looking for reliability and support, look elsewhere.",NEGATIVE

"I purchased an ASUS laptop that was advertised to have a backlit keyboard but didn’t include this feature. Within three days, the laptop started showing defects. After contacting ASUS Service Center, they issued a DOA certificate. However, Amazon refused to accept the return, citing their return policy. Left with no choice, I filed a case with the consumer court. Only after 17 days did Amazon finally accept the return. This experience was highly frustrating and disappointing",NEGATIVE

I was skeptical about buying from acer at first but the quality and features really took me by surprise and I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for the best value for their money.

Also, it would have been nice to have more colour options for the hardware.",POSITIVE
Value for money,POSITIVE
Very very happy your product quality and looking very nice,POSITIVE
"Amazon delivered the product late despite following up non stop. And since I was traveling, I got it delivered at a friends place. I came back after the return window was closed.

"Purchase & Delivery Experience I ordered the boAt Energyshroom PB600 Pro 27000mAh Power Bank (Steel Blue) from Amazon and was initially given a delivery date of two days later. Since I needed the power bank urgently, I contacted Amazon Customer Care to request early delivery. The customer service agent was extremely helpful and accommodating, ensuring the product was delivered a day before the scheduled time. Kudos to the team for such great support!  Unboxing Experience The power bank arrived sealed in two layers of packaging:  The outer package was properly sealed with the boAt logo sticker intact, indicating no tampering. However, upon opening the outer packaging, I noticed that the inner box was not fully sealed. One side of the box appeared to have been cut open with a sharp object, which was concerning. While the product inside seemed intact, this raised a bit of suspicion about the handling or quality control during packaging. Please refer to the attached image for clarity.  Initial Impressions of the Power Bank Build Quality & Design:  The power bank is compact and pocket-sized, making it very portable for a 27000mAh capacity. The Steel Blue color looks sleek and premium. The body feels sturdy, and the overall design is minimalist and functional, which is typical of boAt's products. Port Availability:  3 Output Ports: Perfect for charging multiple devices simultaneously. Type-C Input/Output (2-Way): A useful feature for faster charging and better compatibility with modern devices. Charging Performance (Initial):  Since I received the product only recently, I am currently charging it to full capacity before testing its performance. After using it multiple times, I’ll update this review with more details about its charging speed, efficiency, and ability to charge devices like smartphones, earbuds, and smartwatches. Pros (So Far): Compact Design: Despite its high capacity, the power bank is lightweight and easy to carry. Versatile Ports: Great for people who need to charge multiple gadgets at once. Customer Service: Amazon's timely delivery and support made the experience better. Cons (So Far): Packaging Issue: The inner box being unsealed and damaged (cut open on one side) was disappointing. I hope this is not a recurring issue for other buyers. Next Steps I will be using the boAt Energyshroom PB600 Pro to charge my smartphone, earbuds, and smartwatch in the coming days. Once I’ve tested its performance, durability, and actual charging capacity, I’ll share a detailed update regarding its efficiency and reliability.  Overall, my initial experience is mixed: while the power bank seems promising, the unsealed inner package raised some concerns about quality control. Stay tuned for a more in-depth review after extended use",NEGATIVE
"Its great for charging my different devices as it's capacity is 27,000mAh which is definitely a game-changer. With its large capacity, it can charge your devices multiple times. Fast charging ensures efficiency while the sleek design makes it portable. Perfect for long trips or heavy daily use . Thank you Amazon for sending such a great product.",POSITIVE
"The C Pin charged failed to work in 1 days time, waste of money. boat company credibility is really questionable for selling such poor quality product, when the owner talks big in the TV channel - Shark Tank. I would recommended not buy added to this is the weight of the product, it's too heavy to carry",NEGATIVE
Very compact in size and light weight. This makes it very easy to carry on phone but has amazing capacity. Very sturdy built quality and feels premium. Compatible with type c cable and charges really quickly when wired and wireless. Happy with the investment and would run long for sure,POSITIVE
"The boAt EnergyShroom PB600 delivers exceptional performance with its 27000mAh capacity and 160W output. Equipped with dual USB-C and USB-A ports, it seamlessly charges laptops, smartphones, and other devices. The 100W Type-C cable ensures rapid charging, while the elegant gunmetal finish adds a premium touch. Perfect for travel and heavy-duty power needs.",POSITIVE
The boAt PB600 Energyshroom Air powerbank is really a good powerbank for corporatejob people if they go on different places. Because it can charge you laptop along with your mobile phones and earbuds and other devices. The charging speed is very fast. Its maximum output is 160W and for 2 devices it diverted into 80w each.  This boat powerbank features a convenient LED light indicator that displays the remaining battery level so that you managethe chargingof your powerbank. For me this is the most durable powerbank ever...... beacuse I've used many powerbanks in the past but the output provided by this powerbank not provided by others. The best thing is that the price is under 5k. Just grab.... if you want relaible powerbank.,POSITIVE
"The boat 27000 mah powerbank is very unique powerbank because generally other don't provide such massive battery powerbanks. The build quality, ease of carrying, and compactness of the boAt PB600 Energyshroom is all what i liked the most. The design is very compact amd beautiful.  I would suggest you to buy this powerbank then after this you need not to buy any other powerbank beacuse the performance of the powerbank is very great. The output is 160W which can easily charge your laptop as well. Also it can charge 4 devices at a time. Highly impressed with this powerbank.  You should also buy it....!!!!",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased a laptop stand that has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and overall value. This product has truly transformed my workspace, and I'm eager to share my positive experience.  First and foremost, the build quality of this laptop stand is outstanding.

The stand is both lightweight and portable, making it easy to carry around and use in various settings.  What sets this laptop stand apart is its versatility. It offers multiple adjustable angles, allowing me to find the perfect ergonomic position that suits my preferences. Whether I'm working for extended hours or simply browsing the web, the stand accommodates my needs, reducing strain on my neck and improving overall comfort.

This has not only contributed to the longevity of my laptop but also improved its overall performance.  Beyond its functional benefits, the affordability of this laptop stand is truly impressive. Considering the high-quality materials and thoughtful design, the price point is more than reasonable.

I recently got myself a second Portable monitor which is 15.6 inches. I needed a stand which would help hold the monitor. This product met my requirements and I’m happy to have purchased it. The build quality is very good. It’s sturdy and stable. The rotation feature makes life easier to view the screen from different angles when needed.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a Portable Monitor Stand.,POSITIVE
Get some vertical extra space. Not portable and super stable.  Worked for me somehow. Left it in office though when leaving. Cheers,NEGATIVE
"I don’t even know where to begin. The build quality is chef's kiss—solid and feels premium. You’d think you just bought a high-tech gadget. But the moment you put a laptop on it, you realize it’s more like a carnival ride for your expensive device. The thing wobbles so much, I thought my laptop was about to break into a dance-off.  Seriously, it’s not a laptop stand; it’s a “shake your gadget” stand. Forget typing; every keystroke feels like an earthquake simulation. Tried to watch a movie? The screen was wobbling so much, it gave me motion sickness.  If you want to turn your laptop into a breakdancer or a shaky YouTube setup, this is the product for you. Otherwise, save your money and your sanity. What a complete waste of cash! Zebronics, I expected better—this is one unstable disaster of a stand. 👎",NEGATIVE
"Quality of this laptop stand is absolutely stunning. Great built quality, fantastic colour. The size of the stand holds 15 inch laptop so comfortably. You can adjust to your comfortable position and fast and the screws. This is really study to keep the laptops. The adjustment can be done for any angles, the high raise angle is so much comfortable since it is sturdy and brings the laptop front from its usual view angle. I use dual monitor, so this is so much comfortable to place a mechanical keyboard and huge monitor in the same desk. This is especially designed for keeping the laptop in a comfortable position and using an external keyboard. Since this is high raise position you can't expect typing experience. Tools provided for the adjustment is really great. Overall this is worth buying and I recommend this product who use multiple monitor along with the laptop.",POSITIVE
"After two recent unfortunate attempts to buy this product on Amazon, getting unsatisfactory and outright fraudulent products, this one came as a big positive surprise. Solidly built, meets expectations, meets specifications.",POSITIVE
Quality of products is good but the working is not good laptop is not stable while working. It closes it self many time while working could be better,NEGATIVE
"I very much like this product item. I am using this product for working in a Laptop. Good quality, more Flexible and more comfortable. Value for money. Very Happy.",POSITIVE
excellent,POSITIVE
"While brand is already covering accidental & warranty for 1 year, they're still insisting to start coverage from day 1 and cheat the customers. Insurance never has co-extensiveness with brand warranty but they're insisting it has to be and thereby defrauding the customers. Please do not buy any OneAssist products instead go with brand for extended coverage. That way you are assured of the period of coverage & also that your product is assured.",POSITIVE
Sarvice,NEGATIVE
Good,POSITIVE
Useful,POSITIVE
Don't buy this until Amazon assure you proper support. Because this extended warrenty has co pay Clause. In which we also have to pay 10-20 percent cost.,NEGATIVE
s a good protection plan. The best part is that they don't have any capping that the phone has to be insured within 1 day of purchase. I have not claimed any damages till now but still I think at least they give an option to have you peace of mind even if your device is a little old.,POSITIVE
Worst product. I had purchased the service with my product but couldn't able to activate the service. Lengthy and worst procedures to activate product. I have faced many problems to activate service so finally I have decided to cancel my order. If there are so many problems faced when activating service then when I have to use service how many problems will I have to faced so I have cancelled my order. Don't go for this service.,NEGATIVE
"I recently purchased this laptop cleaning kit, and it exceeded my expectations! The spray is gentle yet effective, leaving my screen spotless without any streaks. The microfiber cloth is soft and perfect for delicate surfaces, ensuring no scratches. The duster is a great addition, easily removing dust from hard-to-reach areas like keyboard keys. This kit is a must-have for keeping your laptop clean and looking brand new. Highly recommended for anyone who values their gadgets!",POSITIVE
"The 3-in-1 cleaning kit is a versatile and efficient solution for various cleaning tasks. It includes a dusting tool, microfiber cloth, and spray bottle, all working together effectively. The dusting tool reaches tight spaces, while the microfiber cloth ensures a streak-free finish on surfaces, and the spray bottle delivers the right amount of cleaning solution. However, the cloth could have been larger for more convenience during bigger cleaning jobs. Despite this, the kit remains lightweight, easy to use, and time-saving. Overall, it's a practical option, but the small cloth leads to a 4-star rating instead of 5",POSITIVE
Quantity is sufficient in this price range according to size. Spray quality is good. It does good cleaning. Smell is also pleasing.,POSITIVE
Nice product. LCD TV screen was cleaned thoroughly. Though the brush which was included in the package was not of good quality as its bristles are breaking all the time. But the solution and the fiber cloth are genuinely good.,POSITIVE
Not perfectly clean the dust but ok product,POSITIVE
Great product at a very affordable price,POSITIVE
"This screen cleaning solution effortlessly removes fingerprints and smudges. The gentle formula leaves screens sparkling clean without any streaks. It's safe for all types of screens, from phones to monitors. The included microfiber cloth is soft and effective. This product is a must-have for keeping your devices looking their best.",POSITIVE
I am very satisfied with my purchase...great product in amazing price range...it's better than all other gadgets cleaners available online,POSITIVE
Thanks to amazon for giving massive discount on my sbi card during republic day sale which made it possible for me to get this beast. It performs as you think it would. Everything runs buttery smooth but there is battery drop issue i think 230w adapter will fix that aside from that there is not problem and rgb backlight keyboard would have been cool.,NEGATIVE
So the best thing about this laptop is that the build quality is sturdy. Do note that this processor has no iGPU so your battery life is limited to 4 hours and does not go higher than that when not plugged in. That being said a friend of mine got the G14 zyphrus and we were gaming at max settings and this laptop did not hit 60 degrees whereas the G14 was touching 85 degrees hence the cooling system is amazing. Another thing I have realised is that I don’t use the laptop when it isn’t plugged in and I do not require 15 -20 hrs of battery life. Also all tasks and jobs run very smoothly on this and I feel its worth the trade off for price and hardware,POSITIVE
"Got it at 71k, faced a screen flickering issue after 2 days but other than that it worths every single penny in terms of display and gaming. It has better display and gaming performance then nitro and victus.",NEGATIVE
"As people have mentioned previously, the main issue is due to unavailablity of iGPU which spoils the battery life. Overall a decent laptop and worth the price.  I’ll edit my comms after using it for a couple of months",NEGATIVE
So far i am really satisfied with my Laptop. Yes there are some things that could have been better. Like the brightness could have been better. But the colour accuracy and all is good. The build is noce. Speaker quality is good not so bad but could have been better. It is on a heavier side but you know it is a gaming laptop. Many people complaint about the fan noise but i think most of the gaming laptops have this thing. It is just to keep your machine cool you can ignore that. The fan speed can be kept in quiet mode in normal usage. Battery life if you ask me lasted for 2.5-3hrs but i saw a minor charge drop while i was using heavily. 170w charger is not enough. J suggest you contact the customer care and get a 230w one. I bought it for ₹69k during republic day sale. I think its worth every penny.,NEGATIVE
A fully charged laptop dies in just one hour of Bubble game. I bought a gaming laptop for it's efficiency. But never expected such a low quality battery in such a new age laptop. How will I travel with this kinda of a laptop. How will I do anything at all if the battery does not last even an hour. Am I expected to stay plugged in all the time ?? I am disappointed. Why are they selling such low quality laptops or even making them for that matter. Useless.,NEGATIVE
Everything is very good but battery is equally bad,NEGATIVE
I would suggest to wait for some sale and go for 4060 with 7-8k more else you might regret when games like GTA 6 drops! Click on my profile to see gaming laptop idealist for more choices.,NEGATIVE
"Reviewing after 1 month of usages!! First I'm confused about this laptop because of the negative review ,it's a great laptop for basic use & for professionals. Pros- -The build quality is good 👍🏻, - the design is very sleek smooth - keyboard quality and keys are good, ☺️ -Processor is beast very much satisfied , -Battery life is also average max 4 hr to 5 hr depends on usages , - lenovo service is so good I can say cause I noticed that my touchpad is sometimes lagging(coz of BIOS not uptodate) so I connect with the support team in lenovo offical website , he fixed it in just 10 mins! ☺️  CONS - Brightness is bit low have to set in 80 to100 range - speaker sound is average! - while charging the heating issue felt but not very much - only 60hrz refresh rate not satisfied - sometimes display wombling not much but little - backlit light is dim. Overall it'a good laptop ♥️ 4.5/5 If your priority is not gaming or editing then you can go for it! 👍🏻",POSITIVE
Almost using it for 5 days :-  Pros :- 👍👍 .) Build quality💥 .) Display worth the money .) Battery life - I got 7.5 hrs with normal usage ( offline movies + YouTube + Browsing + Pdf reading) with Wifi and Bluetooth turned on all the time...I kept brightness at 30% ( since It is sufficient for me in indoors ) and in dark mode... Another time I got only 5.5 hrs of battery life...so not sure of the exact battery span. .) Flip to start is very useful .) Booting time is only 10-15 secs max .) Performance is good for this budget .) Light weight and very convenient to use especially for studying  Cons :- 👎👎 .) Heating issue while charging😮‍💨 .) Sometimes it heats up even with normal usage .) Speaker is good but sound is low .) Missing fingerprint sensor/Facial recognition in this range  Tips :- .) Don't charge immediately after using for more hours...let the heat to cool down and then charge .) After charging let the heat to cool down..then start to use ( will Increase battery span )  Product got delivered b4 the due date...and packaging was good 👍  Conclusion : Simply go for it if you are a student and doesn't play that much of games💥,NEGATIVE
"Very good Investment. Battery, Performance, Display, Speaker excellent.",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop few days back. There was an issue with the screen so I had to return/replace it. The amazon guys has been lying from start. They said they were going to initiate a lenovo technician visit. I waited for 2 days, no one came so I called lenovo directly. They said they had no notification regarding any booking of technician visit.  Once I booked the technician visit in lenovo's side a visit was arranged. In the meantime amazon kept telling me that their hands are tied as long as the product is not sealed by lenovo. Once lenoco technician checks the project and gives no objection for return we will return/replace it immediately. Now it has been almost 2 weeks, everyday a return is created and gets cancelled saying the product was not ready when actually no one visited.  My biggest mistake was to buy it from amazon. The laptop is actually good. But directly from lenovo or may ve croma.",NEGATIVE
"It's very slim , The build is plastic but it's very tough , the display is FHD and it's a good display, The processer is actually a beast but you need to use it on charging to utilise it's full capacity , battery backup despite of having a H series processor and 48W Battery it performs very well and give you a 5hr screen on time the sound isn't too loud but if you keep it on your lap or so then you won't face any issue , And the main keypoint of this laptop is it's i7 13gen processor which is very very powerful but remember it has a intel UHD graphics so you are not going to play any graphics involving games it won't be a smooth experience overall a good product for real",NEGATIVE
"First of all thanks to Amazon for the fastest deliveries less than 24 hours with good shape. Now on the laptop front superb finish love at first sight, it is a clean laptop with all the essential features. Top lid is of metal a premium quality laptop with precise cut at each and every corner. It is a 12th Generation i5 - 12450H processor laptop due to which no issues at the processing of task no matter what you give, it run as a breeze, no fingerprint sensor, no graphics card it had a internal graphics card which is terrible if you want this laptop for gaming purpose then do not purchase this. I have purchased this as i have no use of graphics card.  Pros:  ASPECT RATIO: 16:10 ( Major highlight which is helpful in Coding ) SCREEN : IPS Panel with 60Hz resolution with good viewing angle. CHARGER: 65 Watt Charger with USB type C FRONT CAM: 720p with privacy shutter. SSD: 500 GB (with upgradable option) TRACK PAD : Very nice wide and smooth scroll with good tactile feedback. BACKLITE KEYBOARD : YES  Cons:  RAM: 16 GB ( not upgradable this is a major downside of this laptop which is so expensive) HDD: ( no slot for HDD ) FINGERPRINT : NO GRAPHICS CARD: Inbuilt  HEATING ISSUE:  Most important due to which I gave it a less rating since Lenovo knows it is a H series processor therefore vents should be cut out at the side end of the laptop but at present the vent is at the screen & bottom end due to which when performing high priority tasks it becomes hot as it is clocked at base 2.0 Ghz the keyboard area becomes hot and due to vents placed at screen side screen & metal lid becomes hot not that much hot but still a premium laptop Ideapad 5 series should not have this kind of issues. During benchmark test the keyboard area becomes serious hot and the screen area the right bottom area becomes hot due to vent throwing air at the screen.",NEGATIVE

The tracking and responsiveness is adequate enough . build quality is good and simple design-,POSITIVE
"Great mouse for the price. The design is simple and comfortable for long hours of use. The tracking on smooth surface is not smooth or accurate, So we also need to buy mouse pad.

Clicking sound is loud but it does the job. I like it.,POSITIVE
"I've been using a Logitech mouse for the past three months, and I am thoroughly delighted with its performance, particularly its silent click feature. As someone who values peace and quiet, the near-silent clicking experience is a real upgrade. It’s perfect for working in shared spaces or late-night sessions without disturbing others.  Another most notable improvements is the battery life. In the past, I was constantly changing batteries in my previous mouse every month. With this Logitech model, however, the battery has lasted well beyond expectations, still functioning without any issues. This has saved me the hassle and cost of frequent replacements.",POSITIVE
"If your looking for a value for money mouse this is the one fell down multiple times and it's still strong and works greatly , doesn't have much lag , it has not much of a grip so it's slippery it's pretty accurate to buy can't say much about it in short a great value for money product",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Logitech M221 Wireless Mouse, and it’s exceeded my expectations! The silent buttons are perfect for my workspace, allowing me to click away without disturbing anyone.

Plus, it's ambidextrous, making it comfortable for everyone. Highly recommend this mouse for anyone looking for a quiet and efficient option!",POSITIVE

"I purchased this in July 2023. Its Jan 2025, the left click just stopped working. No damage or drop, no shock to the mouse body. Dropping this review after 5 day work week usage.  While it lasted, it worked very well. But paying 800 for a mouse that will have such a small life is not worth it. Not expected from a brand like Logi.",NEGATIVE
"Very bad quality, not even a week from the purchase and the mouse is not working properly.",NEGATIVE
"Delivery was fast. Product came well packaged and works well. Easy to use, plug and play. Smooth movement on the table and very comfortable for my small hands. I like that the click sounds are very silent.",POSITIVE
"Reliable and easy to use mouse with pretty good battery usage. The bad thing is when the batteries start to be weak, and before the leds starts indicating weak batteries, the mouse tend to be wobbly, and you can't really tell until you tested with a new battery. Their life span is about 2 to 3 years based on my experience with this model over the years. That said, it's the cheapest mouse I can find that works good.",NEGATIVE
As compared to its price the mouse works really well I am using it for about 1 week and it is working well with my laptop it only required a cell that might work for about 6 months. So go for it because it is a good buy if you have low budget.,POSITIVE

Excellent wireless mouse. Light weight. Scrolling ability is also good. It is good for gaming purpose. It is easy of use. Design also good. Size is medium. My view point is for normal use it's a best for you.,POSITIVE
"Good product. 5 stars just for just perfect working product. However packaging was subpar. Not even an Amazon brown packaging. The mouse has a portronics brand cover with picture of mouse, this was sent as is. Too irresponsible and cheap packaging.",NEGATIVE
The mouse is lightweight and will not cause fatigue. Built quality is average but fine for this budget. Design wise the groove tend to pickup dust and hard to clean the crevice.  One issue that I found is after using for 6months the scroll wheel is registering phantom movement and sometimes the scroll jumps up and down when I use it.,NEGATIVE

"First, the price point is very attractive for a Bluetooth mouse. I have been using this for two weeks now, and I really like it. As it can be used with Bluetooth, I no longer have to worry about the USB receiver every time. The Clicks are very silent. The RGB lighting adds an aesthetic appeal to the mouse.  But the scroll wheel feels a bit hard, and it doesn't scroll very smoothly. The boss mode only works with Windows but not with Mac. It would be nice if there was a button or a way to know the battery remaining. Right now, I have to turn it off and on to know the battery level.  Overall a worthy purchase.",POSITIVE

Rating: 8/10 Strong points for reliability, features, and performance. An excellent choice for users seeking a capable wireless mouse for daily computing tasks.",POSITIVE
Awesome mouse. Good battery life and Connectivity is great. Ergonomy is great. I really like the silence touch.,POSITIVE
"Loved the mouse! It's smooth, clicks are quiet and it connects without any issues. And another major pro is the DPI setting. I'm used to 1000+ DPIs, and thankfully this has settings to adjust. The only con that I could think of is the LED light that keeps glowing, which to me seems a little unnecessary. But other than that small thing, no complaints. Still giving it a 5-star!",POSITIVE
The product is really good.. I previously tried many products that doesn't work as they describe in the product info..

The aluminum design not only looks sleek in my workspace but also provides excellent stability. I appreciate that it can accommodate laptops up to 20.3 inches, making it versatile for different devices. The stand helps free up desk space, which is a huge plus for keeping my area organized.

Overall, though, it’s a great addition to my setup and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a practical and stylish solution!",POSITIVE
It is sturdy and serves the purpose. As you see in the images it is holding my two laptops verywell without any wobbling. Setting it up is also an easy task as they provide the tool to tighten or loosen the slots for the size of the laptops. All in all a good purchase.  #enqframes,POSITIVE

"### Product Review: ZEBRONICS Igloo 1, 2.0 USB Computer Speakers  If you're looking for budget-friendly computer speakers under ₹500, the **ZEBRONICS Igloo 1, 2.0 USB Speakers** are a decent choice. These speakers are compact, lightweight, and easy to use, making them a good option for basic audio needs.  ### Pros: - **Affordable**: The price point is the biggest highlight, offering value for money. - **Plug-and-Play**: Powered via USB, the setup is hassle-free and convenient for laptops or desktops. - **Compact Design**: The small size makes them portable and space-saving.  ### Cons: - **Basic Sound Quality**: The audio output is average, which is expected at this price. Don’t expect a rich or immersive sound experience. - **Limited Bass**: The speakers lack depth in bass, making them unsuitable for music enthusiasts or high-quality audio playback.  The ZEBRONICS Igloo 1 speakers are ""just doing the job"" as entry-level speakers. They’re perfect for casual use, like listening to podcasts or basic media playback. However, for a superior audio experience, you’ll need to look at higher-priced options.  Overall, these speakers are a great deal for those on a tight budget and with minimal audio requirements.",POSITIVE
"Product quality is up to the mark. And the sound quality is also good, but the thing is that there is 0. Absolutely, 0 base so don't expect base. India is a tiny, powerful speakers. They provide a good amount of sound like a loudspeaker easily. You can set these 2 speakers Fur much loudness with the help of power bank also. But I was expecting base even though you adjust the base in the equaliser.These speakers are not designed to Output the base anyways.I'm totally satisfied with the quality and the sound.",POSITIVE
"Design is poor. The wired speaker required an AUX port as well as a USB port for power. The ports on my laptop are on either sides of my laptop motherboard. The cables are not long enough to conveniently circumvent the keyboard. The cable stretches over keyboard hindering keyboard usage experience. Prevents usage of other ports.  Sound quality is poor for a wired speaker of given price.  No return option. Replacement options gives only a troubleshoot and a contact customer care choice. Hardware design cannot be troubleshooted. Customer care is thoroughly disappointing.  On the whole, a disaster experience personally.",NEGATIVE
- decent sound. - don't expect deep bass from this tiny speaker - value for money - has few RGB modes - RGB turned off because this model comes with dedicated RGB control switch,NEGATIVE
Very good product inverter price,POSITIVE
"Product ZEBRONICS Igloo 1"" I will not be putting any pics as there are plenty available. Only Pros and Cos: Pros: -Good build quality for Rs. 400 -Sound is loud and mainly focuses on mids and highs, It has little spatial effect. -Can get very loud. -Good for listening mild music though bass is almost flat. -Good for calls and online classes, superb clarity -Good stereo effect as they are not soundbar - Wire sizes are ok, can carry them around in your laptop bag. Cons:- -minimalistic bass. -very mild distortion at and above 90% volume. but I never go above 60% which is ideally sufficient for me. -No controls for RGB light and both left and right lights don't sync with each other. -no padding beneath speakers.  Overall, a good sounding tiny speakers. I am running these speakers with an active subwoofer so I have no complains with bass and they pair with them beautifully.",POSITIVE

Received a defective product which is not working. The process of replacement is also not clear. They are asking to contact the manufacturer (Lenovo) or visit any Lenovo service centre. The number provided to contact is not functional. Only option left is to visit a service centre now.,NEGATIVE
Very good product,POSITIVE
I dont think its original or not but charger works but its kind of slow from my previous charger its good,NEGATIVE
Very good laptop charger for lenovo laptops,POSITIVE
"I've been using this mouse for about 1.5 months, and it's been great so far. Here’s what I love: 1. Build quality: Sturdy and can handle accidental drops. 2. Battery life: Lasts about a month for me with 5-6 hours of daily use (without the LED light on). 3. Quite buttons: Perfect for office work(a little clicky sound), and key quality is good. 4. Quick response: Haven’t gamed with it, but it feels fast. 5. Sleep mode: Saves power when not in use.  A couple of things I haven't used much: 1. LED light: I got excited about the RGB, but rarely use it. 2. Extra buttons: Handy for navigation, but I don’t use them often yet.  Overall, it's a solid, quality mouse at a great price. It took a little time to get used to its size, but it’s comfortable, and I haven’t had wrist pain even without a cushion pad. Highly recommend!",POSITIVE
"The mouse is very comfortable to hold and can be used for long time without any pain, bluetooth and 2.4GHz works perfectly and the lights are very beautiful and the product comes in a matte finish so it looks premium if you ever get confused of choosing this mouse black or white this one looks more pretty on black as RGB is more prominent than the white one. Always use it with toad one plus mode as it gives the best experience. Size is like normal mouse but the lower part is little thick compared to other mouses providing better gripping as it's sides are bended in. Scrolling is good, click noise is minimum as you can hear in the video overall the mouse is very good and easy to use if its under 600 then go for it as flipkart is selling this mouse @rs. 750.  One thing is wrong mentioned in the manual is that after full charge the light doesn't change to green it stays still in blue colour.",POSITIVE
Excellent mouse for the price. The top of the mouse has great quality and soft touch matte finish. The ergonomics are good. I used to use a flat mouse and my hand used to hurt after sometime but now after switching to this my hand doesn’t hurt at all. The bottom of the mouse is average in quality but that doesn’t matter. 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth modes are working fine. The RGB lights aren’t smooth in terms of changing colours but looks decent in the dark. The buttons on the side are for going back and forth in the web pages but can be customised using third party software. The clicking noise is a bit loud but it’s nothing too crazy. 4 levels of DPI options are available and the scroll wheel is decent. Works with both my Windows laptop and MacBook. Overall great product for the price.,POSITIVE
"I am using this for a week now and it works as expected. Product quality and touch and feel is really good. They used soft plastics and smooth school wheel, rgb lighting are ok. Compared to the brand like dell, hp, lenevo this delivers great quality for the money.",POSITIVE
Very good product with Great connectivity at this price range. Recommended for gaming as latency is very accurate.,POSITIVE
"The mouse has been a great addition to my setup! It offers versatile connectivity, a comfortable design, and a cool RGB lighting effect, making it ideal for work and entertainment. Here’s my take on its performance after a few weeks of use:  Pros: Dual Wireless Connectivity: The 2.4 GHz wireless and Bluetooth 5.3 dual-mode is super convenient! I can connect it to my laptop, tablet, and smartphone, all at the same time, and switch seamlessly between devices. Rechargeable Battery: Love the rechargeable feature—it’s eco-friendly and saves money on disposable batteries. Plus, it lasts a good while on a single charge. 6 Buttons for Extra Functionality: The additional buttons make it easy to customize shortcuts, especially for productivity or light gaming. It’s handy if you need quick access to commands. RGB Lighting: The RGB lights add a cool touch without being too flashy. They can be turned off if you prefer a cleaner look or want to save battery. Ergonomic Design: The mouse feels very comfortable in hand, even after long hours of use. It’s lightweight and well-shaped, making it easy to grip.  Cons: Battery Indicator Missing: There’s no way to tell when the battery is low until it suddenly runs out. An indicator or low-battery notification would be helpful. Limited RGB Customization: While the RGB lighting is nice, there aren’t many options to customize colours or patterns. Average Performance for Gaming: While it's fine for everyday use and light gaming, serious gamers might find the DPI and response time a bit lacking(use 2.4ghz for gaming, better response).  Overall: This mouse is a fantastic value if you’re looking for a multi-device, dual-mode, rechargeable mouse that’s comfortable and stylish. It’s perfect for work, browsing, and light gaming, and the RGB lights add a nice touch. Just be mindful of the lack of battery indicator, and you’re all set!",POSITIVE
"Its ergonomic design ensures long-term comfort, while the precision scroll wheel and customizable buttons enhance workflow efficiency. The battery life is exceptional, lasting up to 70 days on a full charge. Bluetooth and USB receiver connectivity provide flexibility. However, it’s slightly expensive, making it better suited for professionals.",POSITIVE
"I've been using this mouse for close to 2 years now. This mouse has worked exceptionally well. It's indeed value for money. For this price range, the mouse worked so well. I've never experienced any issues or lag with the mouse. It connects instantly with my Windows & Mac laptop. I'd definitely recommend this mouse to everyone who's looking for a wireless mouse in this range.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Dell Mouse for the third time, and while it still maintains its reputation for a solid and reliable performance, there have been some unexpected changes that I feel compelled to address.  In my previous encounters with this mouse, the distinctive red light used to be a notable feature, adding a touch of elegance and uniqueness to its appearance. However, this time around, it appears that Dell has disabled the red light, purportedly in the pursuit of enhancing battery efficiency. While I can appreciate the desire for longer battery life, I couldn't help but miss the visual appeal that the red light brought to the table.  Upon receiving the product, I was initially concerned to find that the sensor light was not functioning. However, much to my relief, the mouse itself was fully functional and performed seamlessly, even in the absence of the red light. This is a testament to the mouse's core capabilities and engineering, as it managed to operate flawlessly despite this minor setback.  Pros: 1. Reliable performance: The mouse continues to function flawlessly, delivering precise cursor movements and smooth clicking. 2. Battery efficiency: The decision to disable the red light in favor of improved battery life is a sensible one for users who prioritize extended usage between charges. 3. Ergonomic design: The mouse's ergonomic shape and comfortable grip ensure long hours of usage without discomfort.  Cons: 1. Disabled red light: The omission of the red light, while understandable from a battery efficiency standpoint, takes away from the mouse's visual appeal. 2. Non-functional sensor light: The absence of a functioning sensor light upon receipt can be initially concerning, even though the mouse operates as expected.  In conclusion, the Dell Mouse retains its status as a reliable and dependable peripheral, living up to its reputation for seamless performance. The decision to disable the red light in favor of enhanced battery efficiency might divide opinions, with some appreciating the extended usage time and others missing the distinct aesthetic it brought. The non-functional sensor light upon receipt is a minor hiccup, overshadowed by the mouse's overall functionality. For those seeking a dependable and straightforward mouse experience, this Dell Mouse remains a solid choice.",POSITIVE
Good Pack working perfectly without any flaw. Excellent Mouse.,POSITIVE
Worst roduct. I have ordered this on Dec 11th with COD option. i have received the product which is not working. I tried to replace the item but from amazon no is response.,NEGATIVE
"I got two of these - one from Amazon and one from an Offline Store in Hyderabad. One stopped working within 6 months and I had to get another. Although the mouse looks sturdy, it lacks for in longetivity. Either the mouse stops working or the dongle does. I asked the Dell Retail Technical Support to replace the products as both of them were well within the warranty period. Technical Support had specifically suggested to check the working condition of the replacement mouses before accepting them. Guess what, the Delivery Agent (booked via DHL) refused to let me check the working condition of the mouses and created a big altercation. I had to return the replacement mouses as well. In short, not worth the hassale.",NEGATIVE
"The item itself is great ,it got defective within 6 months but kudos to dell cs they replaced the mouse within 2 days",NEGATIVE
Mouse red on-light wasn’t working. Dell service center chandigarh replaced the mouse. Very helpful people. But again the new piece also had similar issue. So I will be using this. Second time purchase of this same model. Last one lasted 4 years with mid level usage. Good mouse but disappointing purchase experience this time.,NEGATIVE
"The product is pretty decent, and it's fairly well built. After a year of use, my mouse developed some click issues, but Dell promptly replaced it, and I now have a new one that seems to be functioning flawlessly. This mouse only supports one device at a time when linked over Bluetooth, which is problematic for users who rely heavily on bluetooth connection. Although you may always switch between the Bluetooth and the provided dongle, but using two Macbooks at once makes this feature less useful(this is my case, not applicable for all). Therefore, even though this is a fantastic mouse, I would not suggest it if you are a MacBook user who frequently switches between different Macbooks.",POSITIVE
"Nice travel mouse, doesn't take too much space. Good size if your mobile all the time.",POSITIVE
Works well with my Dell laptop. Sensitive and accurate. Comfortable.,POSITIVE
i bought it for child and it met all the requirements processor and battery etc,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased the Lenovo Slim 3 laptop and here are my thoughts on this device:  Pros: Performance: The laptop boasts an impressive Intel Core i5 H series processor. It handles multitasking and daily computing tasks effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for both work and casual use. Display: Display quality is average Keyboard, Webcam, and Touchpad Quality: The keyboard is comfortable and responsive, the webcam delivers clear video quality, and the touchpad is smooth and accurate. AI Features: The AI features are a welcome addition, enhancing the overall user experience with smart and intuitive functionalities. Slimpad 5 Series Features: This laptop includes the latest features from the Slimpad 5 series, adding extra value and usability. Bundled Software: The device comes with Microsoft Office Home 2021 with lifetime validity, a 3-month Xbox Game Pass subscription, and a 1-month McAfee antivirus trial. Activation of these was straightforward and hassle-free. Warranty Activation: Activating the warranty was a smooth and easy process, providing additional peace of mind. Cons: Fingerprint Sensor Issue: Despite the laptop having a fingerprint sensor, I encountered an issue where it cannot be activated. The message ""We cannot find a fingerprint scanner compatible with Windows Hello Fingerprint"" appears, making this feature unusable. Graphics Card: The Intel UHD graphics card is below average for high-intensity, high-end gaming. Gamers looking for robust graphics performance might be disappointed. Build Quality: The build quality is mixed. While the front build quality is good, the base of the laptop feels like it is made from low-grade plastic, which seems less durable. Additionally, the screen tends to shake when typing quickly, which can be distracting. In summary, the Lenovo Slim 3 is a solid laptop with great performance, high-quality keyboard, webcam, and touchpad, and useful AI features. However, the unusable fingerprint sensor, below-average graphics card, and some concerns about the build quality are notable drawbacks. If you can overlook these cons, it offers good value for its price.  Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)",POSITIVE
"Battery drain within 2 hours, considered as H series laptop, the performance is poor in gaming, gta 5 running in 35-40 fps in 1080p all lower settings, touchpad is made of plastic, whole laptop build is plastic, camera is poor, speaker sound is very less. Infinix y1 plus is much better that lenovo slim 3",NEGATIVE

"Low battery backup, scratch on camera and fpoor quality camera, Sound is low , side viewing angles not satisfied, not value for money 😔 . Don't buy for 50k look for MacBook instead as heating issue, screen quality and speed will remain be an issue 😭. Also in MacBook you will be assured that you can use for atleast 8 years and also you will get proper updates from apple. Please 🙏 Don't buy.

"Recently purchased the HP laptop during the Great India Festival sale, and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations. The build quality is top-notch, with a sleek design that is both stylish and durable. The performance is incredible—thanks to its powerful processor and 12GB RAM, it handles multitasking effortlessly and runs all my applications smoothly. The display is vibrant and anti glare, making both work and entertainment a joy. Battery life is excellent, lasting me 4-5 hrs of heavy use which is quite better compare to other laptop in this segmenr. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this HP laptop to anyone in need of a reliable, high-performance device!",POSITIVE
"The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a budget-friendly, mid-range laptop ideal for daily tasks like web browsing, word processing, and light media consumption. It offers good performance with Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and SSD storage, making it suitable for light multitasking and moderate workloads. The design is sleek and portable, with a solid build and comfortable keyboard. The 14-inch Full HD display is decent for indoor use, though not as vibrant as premium models. The battery lasts 6 to 8 hours on a full charge, depending on usage. It offers a variety of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and Ethernet, plus Wi-Fi 6 for fast connectivity. The audio quality is fine for casual use but lacks depth. Overall, the Inspiron 5440 offers great value for users needing a reliable laptop for everyday tasks, though it’s not suited for intensive gaming or content creation.",POSITIVE
Amazon customer care responded but we have to be on roads in traffic up and down but no solution,NEGATIVE
"The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a mid-range laptop that provides solid performance for daily computing tasks, making it a great option for users looking for a reliable, budget-friendly device. Here's a detailed review of its features:  Performance: The Dell Inspiron 5440 typically comes with a range of processors, including Intel Core i5 or Core i7, which offer solid performance for most everyday tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and media consumption. The laptop is also suitable for light multitasking and light media editing. While it’s not a high-performance machine for gaming or intensive content creation (like video editing), it can handle casual gaming at low to medium settings and moderate workloads without significant slowdowns.  Depending on the configuration, you might also get 8GB or 16GB RAM, which provides smooth multitasking, and 256GB or 512GB SSD options for faster boot times and quick file access. For most users, this setup is more than enough for daily productivity and light entertainment.  Design & Build Quality: The Dell Inspiron 5440 has a clean, modern design with a plastic chassis and metal accents. The build is solid for its price range, but it doesn’t have the premium feel of higher-end models like the XPS series. It’s relatively lightweight and portable, weighing around 1.5 to 1.7 kg, making it convenient for students or professionals who need a laptop for work or on-the-go tasks.  The keyboard is comfortable for typing, with well-spaced keys and decent travel, while the trackpad is responsive and supports multi-touch gestures.  Display: The 14-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display provides decent clarity and sharpness for work tasks, media consumption, and browsing. The color accuracy and brightness are generally good for indoor use, but it may fall short in direct sunlight or bright environments. For most users, it offers a solid viewing experience for typical usage, but it's not as vibrant as the displays found in more premium models.  Battery Life: The battery life on the Inspiron 5440 is typically good for a full day of light office tasks, with an estimated 6 to 8 hours of use on a full charge. This will depend on the specific configuration and your usage, but it's generally reliable enough for most users. For more intensive tasks like video streaming or gaming, the battery will drain faster.  Ports & Connectivity: The Dell Inspiron 5440 offers a variety of useful ports, including:  USB-A (2.0 and 3.0) USB-C HDMI (for connecting to external monitors) Ethernet port (for wired internet connection) SD card reader (helpful for transferring photos or files) Headphone jack These ports make it versatile for connecting external devices like storage drives, monitors, or headphones.  The laptop also offers Wi-Fi 6 for faster internet connectivity and Bluetooth for wireless accessories.  Sound: The audio quality is decent for casual media consumption. The built-in speakers are fine for video calls or listening to music in a quiet environment, but they lack depth and bass. For more immersive audio experiences, you might want to use headphones or external speakers.  Overall Value: The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a great value laptop for users who need a dependable device for everyday tasks like browsing, word processing, light media consumption, and light productivity. It offers good performance for the price, solid build quality, and long battery life, making it an excellent choice for students, remote workers, and budget-conscious professionals.  Final Thoughts: If you’re looking for a reliable laptop that covers all the basics and offers decent performance without a high price tag, the Dell Inspiron 5440 is a solid choice. It’s not a powerhouse for gaming or intensive creative work, but it offers good value for money with a reliable design, solid battery life, and satisfactory performance for everyday tasks.",POSITIVE

"Recently, I have purchased a dell laptop model inspiron 5440 (intel core 7 processor) from dell online store. I would like to share my experience.  I would never suggest any one to buy Dell laptop. I have heard before from my friends that Dell laptops are not good, you should never buy them. But, i did not listen to them and purchased this laptop spending a huge sum. I must tell you, the initial one was pathetic. I was facing one issue after another.  They call it thin an light model, but its fan never stop rotating. I have seen so many laptop with similar price range. At least for non of the them, the fan makes these loud noise. Thus i tried contacting dell technical support. They told me, mam, for this model the fan will make this loud noise. There is no solution to it. After that, they remotely installed some software.  Next, i faced speaker issue. There was no sound coming out of my laptop. Again i contacted the dell technical team, they did some thing and it was working fine. But at the same time laptop became slow.  So the technical expert next reset my pc. She was suggesting me to reinstall the operating system also. I told her, it has been only 5 days i bought this laptop, is it necessary.  Now also when i am writing this review, my fan keeps on rotating.  I, being from a middle class family, spend our hard earned money, to buy a good laptop for study purchase. But, i realized now, i have lost a huge sum of money by spending it on this laptop.  Dell website says , you can return our product in 14 days if you don't like it. But their technical support person says neither we will replace it nor you can return it. That means ""Even if you got a defective piece you should keep it"".  I can not get back my money. But at least you should not spend a penny on this useless dell product. I hope my review helps you to make better judgment regarding purchase of dell product. My personal suggestion is please don't buy it. I have been on so much mental stress these days because of the amount of money i spent on this product. And the inspiron 5440 turns out to be total waste",NEGATIVE
This laptop performs something in between the apple M1 and M2 chip air models. Can do the processor intensive tasks easily but gaming obviously suffers since it is a professional laptop.,NEGATIVE
"I bought this because I wanted a USB headphones as 3.5mm port is damaged. This is one of the best headphones available at this price as USB headphones are costly, so price wise it is really good. The headphones are really nice and have a good finishing and build quality good. Sound quality is really good and we dont hear any outside noise while wearing this, I loved it. This headphone is really good at this price. Go for it if you are budget friendly within 1000rs.  Regards,",POSITIVE
"The design is nice. Black looks good. Speaking of comfort, the earpads don't completely cover the ears, so wearing these for very long time (like 3 or 4 hours) can cause discomfort. If the earpads were slightly larger, it would have been nice. I'm satisfied with the sound quality. The material looks sturdy.. would not break that easily.. the bass is mediocre..overall I'm highly satisfied with the product in this price range..",POSITIVE
Noise cancellation is superb. Comfort to wear and audio is perfect.,POSITIVE
"I have been using this headphone since 2021 Dec. If you are not a over boosted sound lover, this one is a best choice. Bass, trible, mids everything is very perfect and clear. One of the great advantage is the call quality. No surrounding noise can be heard in the call. I even used it for my personal audio recordings for different purpose. It was a rough used headphone and because of that, I believe, couple of months back I lost its one side audio. But still I am using it for movie watching. It's not tight on my ears, used it for hours. Only thing I felt bad is the cushion, it torn after a year or 2. But there is a cloth material, which is still surviving :)",NEGATIVE
As it is budget friendly with good wire and cusions quality. average is for like while office call of 30 minute to 1 hour it start some pain in ear border,POSITIVE
"The sound quality is awesome, with rich bass. Thanks to the soft ear pads and adjustable headband, the headphones are comfortable for long periods. The build quality is also superb.  The only minor drawback I've found is that the Mic is not very good. When I try to record sound, the frequency starts waving, like high and low. This is not good for Voice Recording.  If you are a Music lover with the best bass, surely go for it.",POSITIVE
"using the boAt BassHeads 900 for a long time now, and I must say, this is one of the best headsets available in the market at its price point.  The sound quality is excellent, with deep bass and crystal-clear audio. There’s absolutely no noise interference, making it perfect for music, calls, and gaming.  At this price, it’s hard to find a better product that combines performance and durability like this. I have no complaints and would highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for quality headphones without breaking the bank!  #boAtLifestyle #BestHeadphones #ValueForMoney #MusicLovers",POSITIVE

Zebronics makes awesome and affordable product.,POSITIVE
It's worky fine with no problem so far. Hope to carry on for another decade.,POSITIVE
"Here's the detailed review:  Pros: * Really value for money, it's affordable. * Build quality is unexpectedly good and metallic. * It actually has a USB 3 port, I tested the transfer speed and the USB 3 is real. * All 4 of the ports work simultaneously, I've used them together in different applications and didn't disappoint, however you should only connect one High speed storage device (SSDs and USB 3 flash drives) at once, because only the 3.0 port will give you usable speeds, however if you only have old HDDs, USB 2.0 pen drives, or accessories like keyboard and mouse, you're good to go with any of the ports. * It's very slim and compact, no bulk at all even with the sturdy build. * Just plug and play, it's easy to use.  Cons: Aren't really any deal breakers, I just wish the cable was a bit longer and it came with another high speed port, but that's not an issue at this price.",POSITIVE

It’s perfect for basic tasks like browsing, document editing, and casual use.  2. Smooth Performance: The 1200 DPI optical sensor provides decent precision. I’ve used it for light graphic work and general navigation, and it performs reliably without any noticeable lag or misclicks.  3. Compact and Lightweight: It’s easy to carry around, making it convenient for me when I switch between working on my desktop and laptop.  4. Durability: Despite its lightweight build, it feels sturdy. I’ve accidentally dropped it a couple of times, and it still works perfectly.",POSITIVE
"Great on grip and scroll. Tried using it on bed, table, floor without mousepad; really works on most of the surfaces. Basic appearance but high on performance. The scroll button is good enough. Overall this mouse has good sensibility. Its holds good value for money.",POSITIVE
Smooth and works just fine! Has made my life so much better with this investment of just a hundred ruppee.,POSITIVE
"For 109rs (price I paid) there isnt much room to complaint  Works as expected on both android, mac and windows but the plastic used is of low quality  Tried using it on 3 different surfaces – wood, paper, cushion and works on all three without an issue  Also played a little prince of persia using the mouse and the input is alright but sometimes the clicks are not registered but that happened only during the game and not during any productivity tasks. The reason could be 1200cpi (yes cpi not dpi, dpi is used for printers) as the game might not be compatible with the higher number  If you are like me who just wants a mouse to to avoid scrubbing your fingers on the trackpad all the time go for it and for 109rs I wont feel too bad if it stops working. Although there might be cheaper options available in the offline market but im not sure you will find a mouse with higher cpi than 800 if you are living in a grade C city like me",NEGATIVE
"The product is good,but the mouse wheel button is some what hard to click and you never get good product at first time, it takes 2-3 replacement.  ❤️❤️good product at these prize range. ❤️❤️  ( Main thing is you cannot return this product only replacement is available).",NEGATIVE

"I recently purchased this docking station for my Apple MacBook, and it has exceeded my expectations. Crafted from durable metal rather than plastic, it not only offers excellent build quality but also adds a sleek and premium look to my workspace. I primarily use it for office work rather than gaming, and the HDMI functionality works perfectly for my needs. It performs flawlessly, providing reliable connectivity and functionality. If you're looking for a stylish, sturdy, and dependable docking station, this is an excellent choice and a great value for the price. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"While the device works great, the cable provided is a bit too short that connects to the laptop. As a result the docking station keeps hanging once other devices are jacked in. Good for its price point though.",NEGATIVE

The additional USB 2.0 ports are great for connecting peripherals, and I love that it supports PD charging up to 100W, keeping my devices powered up without any hassle. The SD and Micro SD slots are a bonus for quickly transferring media files, especially for my photography needs.  What really sets this dock apart is how seamlessly it works with my MacBook and Thunderbolt 3 devices. It’s reliable, compact, and has made my workspace so much more efficient.

Correction : RAM is inbuilt soldered, cant be increased, this laptop will going to handle only light coding and everyday work browsing etc. Heavy projects cant be guaranteed to run smoothly. RAM is going to be 8 gb always.",NEGATIVE

"Edit: DONT BE FOOLED BY 2 RAM SLOTS  IT CAN TAKE A MAX IF 16GB RAM. SO THE ONLY UPGRADE POSSIBLE FOR THE 1x16GB MODEL IS CHANGING IT TO DUAL CHANNEL 2x8GB.  Found out the hard and sad way, also confirmed with Lenovo.  Old:  The other review covers it very well, it will run whatever you throw at it.  I left Red Dead Redemption 2 running for 20 hours straight. resumed playing still ran like butter.  It comes with 2nd NVME slot but no screw so you'll have to procure it separately.  Others count lack of RGB as a con, but I'll say White looks professional, wich goes with the overall look of the laptop, making it suitable for use in professional environments if you don't want everyone around you knowing you're a gamer.  not being able to charge via the USB C is understandable with 170 W in the adaptor.  90W TDP is boost TPG it will show lower but boosts it to 90W. remains cool without throttling even for longer heavy workloads, hint 20hours of RDR2.  I recommend buying a 2nd NVME along with your purchase as you'll run out of 500 gigs quick. The included disk is a WD BLue SN530, not the best but good performance, not something you'll find slow in your daily usage unless your work is copying > 200 gig everyday.  2Gig of the 16GB included ram go to VRAM .",NEGATIVE
"I bought the 24gb ram, i7 13th nvidia 4050 version. The performance is stellar. I enabled windows ultimate performance in power management options from cmd. I also updated the bios using Lenovo website as the system was prompting the same. The gaming is butter smooth. Temperature management is also very good. I take breaks between 1.5 hour rounds by shutting off the computer when the fan noise peaks. Easily a powerhorse. Lenovo vantage is also very useful in managing power requirements and fan noise. Be sure to remove the paper cover on the charger and keep the charger standing on the long edge/side. Being a laptop it is also advisable to play on full charge with plugged on set up. Keyboard and trackpad are also very very professional. Display is ok ok. For 94000 this is a good gaming plus professional laptop.",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop and upon 100% charging, it gets drained within 3 hours if laptop remains idle, drains within one and half hour if you are watching a YouTube video or using multiple excel files. If you are playing games then it barely lasts till an hour. Very very bad battery life. It is complete waste of money.",NEGATIVE
"Bought it for price 78k on December 2023. Have been using it for 8 months. Most of the modern AAA titles run at 1080p 60fps. The screen refresh rate is 165Hz, which if bought separately costs a lot.  The CPU has 8 cores and 16 Threads, which is enough for any programming, rendering, compilation or virtualization. The Ryzen 7 5800H also has a RX Vega 8 APU graphics which can be used for encoding while streaming, while your main game runs on RTX 3060  I have tested linux on it as well, after disabling secure boot, and installing Nvidia drivers for Nvidia optimus also works and is hassle free.  The only cons might be both the USB ports being on the right side. And the battery-life, but that is to be expected of any gaming laptop.",NEGATIVE
"So this is my second gaming laptop, first one being the Legion Y520 (i5 7th gen, GTX 1050). That laptop lasted 6 years for me and is currently being used by my sister.  Few reasons why I opted for this laptop in particular: CPU and GPU combination - Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3060 @90W TDP Display - 165Hz, 100% SRGB Price: Got it for 89,990  Originally I wanted the MSI Alpha 15 Advantage edition that has the same CPU, but comes with 8GB Radeon 6600M. It was slightly expensive and delivery by Flipkart was quite slow for my address, so I didn't go for it. There were 2 other options from MSI that have RTX 3060 and shipped with i7 CPU, but they did not have color accurate displays (45% color gamut). For these reasons Ideapad gaming 3 became the perfect pick for me and I am impressed with my purchase. Boot times are of course great and games load significantly fast, of course. I am planning to add a 1TB SSD and additional 16GB RAM later which will improve the performance even further!  Following games have been tested by me so far on ultra to medium settings: World of Warships - average FPS 100-120 @ ultra settings Witcher 3 - 60 FPS on ultra settings. For some reason the FPS for this game are locked at 60 A Plague Tale: Innocence - 90-120 FPS on medium to ultra settings Forza Horizon 4 - did not have FPS enable at that time so could not see the actual FPS, but it looked great so I'll assume it was in the range mentioned above  I am planning to try out more games and will update my review accordingly. But so far I am happy with my purchase and can recommend this laptop to future buyers with confidence. Trackpad is quite awesome too, don't know though which driver it is using. Keyboard is great as well, but I use an external keyboard anyway so it does not matter to me. Speakers are satisfactory. They are placed at the bottom and deliver good sound both in terms of quality and loudness.  The device is surprisingly lightweight which is a good thing! Build quality could have been better, but it is definitely not fragile. Keyboard is white backlit only, so no RGB lighting available. I am not into the fancy RGB lighting so it does not bother me at all. I am also thankful that it does not come with red lighting on the keyboard!  Thank you Amazon for quick delivery (16 hours) and thank you Lenovo for this good product.  Edit: I forgot the mention that I played for three hours straight and did not experience any kind of performance throttling. Boot up is almost instant which is expected. Note that it comes with 1x 16GB RAM and my laptop came with WD SN530 SSD. You have one more slot for RAM and SSD each and I've read somewhere that the laptop can support NVMe Gen 4 SSDs, but not sure whether that's true.",POSITIVE
"It is a damn good and very nice price laptop. People were saying that it has battery drain issue, but I found it good. The Battery lasts around 5hrs in normal work including photoshop. The body is strong, design is good. I loved the display.  I was confused between the Infinix one and this one, but this one is much better as Lenovo has broader service area.",POSITIVE

"This laptop is best for students, who want to watch YouTube play some mid-tier games. You can also get HP Victus 16 laptop in this price segment, but it has some pros and cons in that comparison. Pros of Asus S15: 1. Display: 2.8k, Oled, 100%srgb, 600nits brightness(most phones comes with max 400nits, you can compare). 2. Intel Evo 3. Atleast 8hrs of battery on basic usage. 4. Highly intelligent fingerprint: (if you are turning on your PC with your registered fingerprint then it will directly log you in.) 5. Thunderbolt 4. 6. Light weight 1.7kgs. 7. 180deg hinge (it comes handy when you accidently push your screen back, most screen or hinges gets damages due to 120deg hinge) 8. I got this laptop for 84k, but while I'm writing this its 87k. 9. Aluminum back of the display.  Pros of HP Victus 16: 1. Processor: Ryzen 7 79840HS is more powerful than intel i5 13500H 2. Dedicated graphics with 6GB of RAM 3. LAN port with 1Gbps 5. 144hz display 6. Faster RAM 5600MHz vs 48MHz 7. SD card reader (Support SD/SDHC/SDxC) 8. Currently 16-s0095AX version is priced at 81k.  Both of this laptops are latest generation from their manufacturers. Both have DDR5. Both have 512 gen4 ssd.  So, if you are not a hardcore gamer or you are a student then you should go for Asus. Or if you are want to run CPU intensive program then you can go for HP Victus, because multicore performance is very high in this laptop.",NEGATIVE
Recently buy this laptop on 27/09/24 really happy to unbox it bt whin turn it on the screen was blank called customer service associate they told me that replacement is not available only service centre is the last option.in service centre they told me that it will takes 6-7 day if it will not repaired then u will get refund or replacement and not from our side u have to call amazon customer associate and then they arrange a pickup.this was really disappointing.i had saved money from last 6 month to buy a laptop after searching many laptop i found this to buy.

"Delivery is fast (within 3 days) but, open box delivery is not available for my product.  This is my second asus product after asus zenfone max pro m1 mobile.  First its blue colour attracts you.  1). Display is top category in this price segment.  It flickering during charging pin plug in and plug out but don't worry it is not any system defect. To stop it please change screen refresh rate option in my asus app from dynamic to static.  2) Battery is average upto 6 hours normal use. But fast charging is an advantage.  3) Keyboard is also good. Touch pad is a big one, support multi gesture.  4) Processor performance good. I play one 8k video on YouTube ,then it temperature gose to 90°c. It is best for watching upto 4k video. Cooling system is effective.  One thing it not supported windows face recognition as it have not ir camera.  Afterall it is best product in this price segment (Rs. 83990), but unfortunately I buy this at Rs. 86990.  Thank u.",POSITIVE

"No doubt it's the best laptop for students under 40,000. You can use it for study purposes as well as for coding in college you can do code on it. You can play GTA v on low setting but it's not recommend as it's not a gaming laptop.  Pros:- 1. I3 1215u processor is pretty good for day to day task and it can also be used in programming.  2. Comes with a 2level backlit keyboard.  3. Display is also quite good.  Cons:-  I don't found such.  Overall it's best option under 40,000.",POSITIVE
"Hp is a bogus company, this is what I learned after purchasing this laptop. I have Sony Vaio laptop which I purchased in 2011 which have battery care function, which stops battery charging at either 50% or 80% and runs laptop on direct AC power, which in turn extend lifetime of battery. My battery is still good even after more than 12 years of using laptop. I know that well established laptop companies have this feature present in their laptop. Ex. Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, etc. (Not the new laptop companies.). So, I presumed that hp would also have this feature, but after I owned this laptop, I came to know that this crucial feature is absent. And only some of the hp laptop models have this feature. I am very disappointed ☹️. Because when laptop runs on battery power, it's performance is not good.  This laptop's keyboard is also so much bogus and stupid. The clicks are good and also the quality seems good, but the visibility of the text on keyboard is very bad. I use laptop mostly on my study table, and this silvery keyboard's keys text is invisible to read. I have to lean forward to see what's on it. (I think after some time I will get used to it, but as a beginner user of this laptop, it's too much hassle to use this keyboard).  I also have hp gaming mouse that I purchased recently whose back and forward side buttons are of bad build quality. And also I have one bad experience about HP pendrive. Also I have heard about HP printers' bad reputation.  So, I have now decided to never buy any hp company product.",NEGATIVE

I just use my laptop for ppt and browsing purpose only.Within 1 year of purchasing I got literally 3 issues with the laptop and customer care service is pathetic both online/offline hp service agency..Please don't take this product...it is a bogus product The issue is system getting blacked out/hanging even if u use for 10minutes and those guys in the previous complaint had done nothing..they just came to my home and rubbed the ram/driver with an eraser(I SAW THAT) and the issue again started after a month and CUSTOMER CARE WILL LITERALLY PLAY WITH YOU FOR 10-15 DAYS and at last I went to an offline authorised hp(only) service store and they told that software is the issue and a new os had been installed and issue still persists and later they told it's a hardware problem(they said that THEY ARE THINKING BUT NOT SURE(SERIOUSLY!!!) and they told that they will replace the mother board which they will get after 10-12 days by order and if the issue still persists after replacing mother board THEY WILL SEE(STILL)!!!

"ince the moment I bought it, the laptop has never worked properly. I’ve had three different engineers come to repair it, but each time, the issue remains unresolved. It seems like no matter how many times they try, nothing gets fixed. This ongoing problem has caused significant frustration, and the worst part is that I am losing valuable work hours and salary because I can't rely on this laptop to function properly. I expected much better quality and service from HP, and this experience has been nothing but a letdown. I would not recommend this product to anyone based on my experience.",NEGATIVE
Value for money... Nice product.,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased a renewed laptop from Amazon, and I must say that I am extremely disappointed with the product I received. The laptop I received was clearly much older than anticipated, estimated to be at least 4-5 years old. It had obviously been heavily used previously, with numerous changed parts that did not align with the original configuration.  One of the most disheartening aspects was the visible wear and tear on the laptop. It was evident that the laptop had been through extensive use, showing signs of physical damage and cosmetic flaws. It is quite frustrating to receive a product that does not meet the expected quality standards, especially considering it was marketed as ""renewed"" and sold on a reputable platform like Amazon.  Moreover, the fact that the laptop's parts had been replaced with components that did not match the original specifications added to my disappointment. As a customer, I expected a renewed laptop to be refurbished to a condition that closely resembles its original state, with compatible components and in line with the original design.  This experience has left me questioning the reliability of the renewed products sold on Amazon. I feel let down as a customer, as I had trusted the platform to provide a quality product that meets my expectations. This purchase has not only been a waste of my hard-earned money but has also caused a significant inconvenience as I now have to seek an alternative solution for my computing needs.  I hope that Amazon takes this feedback seriously and improves its quality control measures for renewed products. Customers should be able to trust that the products they purchase, even if renewed, are in proper working condition and aligned with the advertised specifications.  In conclusion, I strongly advise potential buyers to exercise caution when considering purchasing renewed laptops from Amazon. Based on my personal experience, I cannot recommend this particular product as it fell far short of my expectations in terms of age, condition, and adherence to the original configuration.",NEGATIVE

"Great laptop. Delivered on time. First impressions - 1. Great build, lid is metal, sturdy and robust. 2. Looks good, handy, not that heavy.  Boot 1. First time gets booted with windows 11, start it up and do product registration pretty straight forward.  Linux 1. Obvious, booted it with ubuntu 22.04, got the FP drivers installed manually (again very straightforward) 2. I got the 8GB ram it works fine, but i have juiced it up with 16gb so total 24gb 3. 2 type c ports, all the ports ull ever need its built into the laptop. 4. Two external monitors works smooth along with built in screen 5. Keyboard is good, I really enjoy typing, tho it could have been little better. Yep its backlit works fine. 6. Battery backup is not that good, couple of hours I get with normal usage, charges quickly, but have to keep charger handy 7. On linux bluetooth and wifi gives you issues, which should be fixable with a usb wifi stick  Final thoughts After considering a lot of laptops, and specifically for linux, this one was a perfect match. you get 8 and 16gb variant go for 8 you get it for 48, I got it for 45 (with offers). Totally worth the money, and it truly is an amazing laptop. #thinkpad.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this 16-inch Lenovo laptop from Amazon and have had a mix of experiences. The fingerprint login is impressively fast, and the larger screen is a welcome upgrade from my previous 15.6-inch laptop. However, I've encountered some minor issues that might be deal-breakers for some. Pros: * Swift Fingerprint Login: The fingerprint sensor is quick and reliable. * Excellent Display: The larger screen offers a more immersive viewing experience. * Bright Backlight: The backlight is sufficiently bright for comfortable viewing in various lighting conditions. * Excellent Linux Compatibility: AMD's superior GPU drivers make this a great choice for Linux users. Cons: * Subpar Speaker Volume: The speakers are quite soft, making it difficult to hear audio clearly, especially in noisy environments. * Average Battery Life: The battery life is around 5 hours, which may not be sufficient for all-day use without a charger. * Touchpad Placement: The touchpad is slightly off-center, which might take some getting used to for some users. * Slight Backlight Bleed: There's a minor backlight bleed issue on the left bottom side, noticeable when viewing a black screen in full screen mode. Despite these drawbacks, this Lenovo laptop offers a decent overall experience, particularly for Linux users who appreciate a larger screen and fast fingerprint login. However, potential buyers should carefully consider the speaker volume, battery life, and touchpad placement before making a decision.",POSITIVE
"I work from home, and I needed a stand that is light, sturdy, and portable. I have repurchased the product. The six angles provide the angle depending on different needs. It a worth every penny for me.",POSITIVE
"Laptop Elevation Stand Review  The laptop elevation stand offers excellent elevation, providing a comfortable viewing angle that greatly reduces strain on the neck and shoulders. Its lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, which is perfect for people who move between workspaces or need something portable.  For work-related tasks and media consumption, this stand works wonderfully. The elevated height helps with ergonomics, and it’s perfect for watching videos or attending online meetings. However, I’m not entirely sure if it’s ideal for gaming, as it doesn’t seem to have features specifically designed for cooling or long gaming sessions.  One concern is the durability of the grips on the holders. They work well initially to keep the laptop stable, but I’m not sure what the solution is if they wear out over time. It would be great if there were some guidance on how to replace or maintain these parts for long-term use.  Overall, it's a solid stand for general use, but there might be some doubts regarding its longevity and performance for more intense activities like gaming.",POSITIVE
It's a good product don't worry about the size because when I first opened it I thought it will break as it appears small in size than my laptop but it works perfectly fine and handles the weight of my laptop the quality is very good I will say it is value for money overall its a good product 👍,POSITIVE

Nice Product. Easy to use and sturdy.,POSITIVE
"Good, good material, easy to carry, price need to be 250",POSITIVE
Very cheap and flimsy. I have another one that was from office works that was well worth the extra money. Even the little rubbery bits on the bottom aren't placed correctly.,NEGATIVE

"So,I am using this laptop from last 10days.. Here are some observations of mine:-  Display is decent at this price as evey other laptop provides. (4/5)  Camera is decent as aswell. 720p is not the best but good enough to attend video calls  Battery is really good because it comes with a 1215u processor. It will give you around 5hrs with 50% brightness or more . (5/5)  Build quality is really good, As most of the product of Asus .. (5/5)  Pro's:- -Good Battery life -Build Quality feels lika a premium laptop -Ms office - Backlit keyboard - single core performance is really good  Con's:- - fingerprints on the laptop will irritate you to clean it.. - Decent heavy task duty because of 1215u You can play gta 5 in low setting with decent fps...  *Best option for students, you'll never regret it*",POSITIVE
"I received this product on 05th October, but the sound of the system is very low and the performance without headphones is not satisfactory. Don't buy this product.",NEGATIVE
"I gave 5 star coz it was a smooth sailing after purchase, 3 months ago. Laptop is excellent for media streaming, and office work. I don't play games or do heavy editing. But over-all this laptop feels premium and will not let u down for the price-tag.",POSITIVE
Worth every rupee. The best specs at this price range (36000 Rs - 39000 Rs). Avg Battery life is about 3.5 hrs. Free MS Office. Speakers are average. Display quality is good at this price range. Valorant can run smoothly with low graphics at avg of 80 fps. Best for students. ( Not for editing and advanced coding ),POSITIVE
"Pros : Size : 15.6 inch fast new generation quad core processor having great security. Looks are awesome 👍 Old windows 11 version 22h2 is provided you have to update it to work smoothly. Graphics processor is as strong as i5 11 th gen G series iris xe. Necessary USB ports are provided. Battery backup is good but depends usage MS office 2021 is provided and McAfee subscription 2 years. Sound is good.  Cons :  Only one major con is its display. Display is not good. It is LCD not IPS.

Outdated softwares,Drivers are the major contributors of heating. So be sure to update every software before start using it.",POSITIVE

"So 1st of all I got this laptop in 41000 during Amazon Great Indian festival.  Now about the laptop. I got this laptop delivered in 9 days which can be considered a ling period but fine by me.The outer box was damaged but inside it was all perfect, so no problem with that.I Don't think this will be a decision maker and please don't make it one  Looks amd design are the best , literally it looks cool and 14 inches make it most beautiful.  ok, now , before buying the laptop I saw many critics of display, but tbh yeah the display is not that ""oled or wuxga quality but as a student I have no problem,like it is pretty normal screen very normal,so if you have very high quality display needs then don't buy this but if you are student or evrn a working professional like me, so yeah the critics were somewhat right but its ok to be honest, it will do the job.  Now battery, now this one is tough to answer, I saw one comment which said 1 hr battery life, ohk yes the battery life is low, but not 1 hr, here is what I have found after using for 10 days:  2 hr battery: intense gaming (played honkai rail star, rocket league, genshin impact, can play valorant too)  3.5-4.5 hrs: Net surfing and video streaming  5hr-6 hr : pdf and book reading (which I as a student use it most for)  See it is a H grade processor,but it is okay guys, chill, it has fast charing too, but I don't use it, cuz yeah ""dell"" in its laptop says the battery health gets depleted,so it must be true for lenovo too.  Processor: It is i5 12th gen BUT a H GRADE , SO IT HAS GAMING CAPABILITY,I played games, it does the work but don't think you will give you performance like dedicated gpu) bit it is faster than 13th gen U processor (you can see the scores online), but yeah the battery life is low due to this only. So yeah again normal-normal.  Hardware is top notch, the keyboard quality is good.  So all in all it is very good laptop, it will get all your normal needs done, go for it ,you will get it in 45k in sale.",NEGATIVE
"Light weight easy to carry, good processor for day to day office work with home 11 and Ms office pre installed. Screen brightness is decent indoor but speaker is pathetic so not recommended for multimedia use case. If you want a laptop for office work with low budget below 50k go for it. I got it for 39k with bank office in great Indian sales and satisfied with it.",NEGATIVE
"Don't Buy this Product. Horrible Experience with Amazon and Lenovo.. - Within 10 days of purchase, display started showing horizontal lines. - Lenovo service center accepted it as hardware issue but they would only replace the part & not replacing the entire product.. This only means, they sent 2nd quality product/refurbished product which got issue within 10 days. Amazon is selling these kind of products online. - While Amazon Customer Service team tried helping but they couldn't get through replacing product as it crossed 7 days period. - Equally disappointed with both Amazon and Lenovo. Will have to be careful buying any electronic items from amazon going forward..",NEGATIVE
Very bad screen quality and viewing angle,NEGATIVE
After using it for a day - Display : pretty good Speakers - Below average Battery life - Good Camera - Good Performed well in dead pixel and keyboard functionality test. Overall amazing laptop for the price .....,POSITIVE

Great laptop wonderful performance UI is very friendly design in so unique smoothness is wow battery is ok and weight is very surpriseing heavy,POSITIVE
"Edit: DONT BE FOOLED BY 2 RAM SLOTS  IT CAN TAKE A MAX IF 16GB RAM. SO THE ONLY UPGRADE POSSIBLE FOR THE 1x16GB MODEL IS CHANGING IT TO DUAL CHANNEL 2x8GB.  Found out the hard and sad way, also confirmed with Lenovo.  Old:  The other review covers it very well, it will run whatever you throw at it.  I left Red Dead Redemption 2 running for 20 hours straight. resumed playing still ran like butter.  It comes with 2nd NVME slot but no screw so you'll have to procure it separately.  Others count lack of RGB as a con, but I'll say White looks professional, wich goes with the overall look of the laptop, making it suitable for use in professional environments if you don't want everyone around you knowing you're a gamer.  not being able to charge via the USB C is understandable with 170 W in the adaptor.  90W TDP is boost TPG it will show lower but boosts it to 90W. remains cool without throttling even for longer heavy workloads, hint 20hours of RDR2.  I recommend buying a 2nd NVME along with your purchase as you'll run out of 500 gigs quick. The included disk is a WD BLue SN530, not the best but good performance, not something you'll find slow in your daily usage unless your work is copying > 200 gig everyday.  2Gig of the 16GB included ram go to VRAM .",NEGATIVE
"I bought the 24gb ram, i7 13th nvidia 4050 version. The performance is stellar. I enabled windows ultimate performance in power management options from cmd. I also updated the bios using Lenovo website as the system was prompting the same. The gaming is butter smooth. Temperature management is also very good. I take breaks between 1.5 hour rounds by shutting off the computer when the fan noise peaks. Easily a powerhorse. Lenovo vantage is also very useful in managing power requirements and fan noise. Be sure to remove the paper cover on the charger and keep the charger standing on the long edge/side. Being a laptop it is also advisable to play on full charge with plugged on set up. Keyboard and trackpad are also very very professional. Display is ok ok. For 94000 this is a good gaming plus professional laptop.",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop and upon 100% charging, it gets drained within 3 hours if laptop remains idle, drains within one and half hour if you are watching a YouTube video or using multiple excel files. If you are playing games then it barely lasts till an hour. Very very bad battery life. It is complete waste of money.",NEGATIVE
"Bought it for price 78k on December 2023. Have been using it for 8 months. Most of the modern AAA titles run at 1080p 60fps. The screen refresh rate is 165Hz, which if bought separately costs a lot.  The CPU has 8 cores and 16 Threads, which is enough for any programming, rendering, compilation or virtualization. The Ryzen 7 5800H also has a RX Vega 8 APU graphics which can be used for encoding while streaming, while your main game runs on RTX 3060  I have tested linux on it as well, after disabling secure boot, and installing Nvidia drivers for Nvidia optimus also works and is hassle free.  The only cons might be both the USB ports being on the right side. And the battery-life, but that is to be expected of any gaming laptop.",NEGATIVE
"So this is my second gaming laptop, first one being the Legion Y520 (i5 7th gen, GTX 1050). That laptop lasted 6 years for me and is currently being used by my sister.  Few reasons why I opted for this laptop in particular: CPU and GPU combination - Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3060 @90W TDP Display - 165Hz, 100% SRGB Price: Got it for 89,990  Originally I wanted the MSI Alpha 15 Advantage edition that has the same CPU, but comes with 8GB Radeon 6600M. It was slightly expensive and delivery by Flipkart was quite slow for my address, so I didn't go for it. There were 2 other options from MSI that have RTX 3060 and shipped with i7 CPU, but they did not have color accurate displays (45% color gamut). For these reasons Ideapad gaming 3 became the perfect pick for me and I am impressed with my purchase. Boot times are of course great and games load significantly fast, of course. I am planning to add a 1TB SSD and additional 16GB RAM later which will improve the performance even further!  Following games have been tested by me so far on ultra to medium settings: World of Warships - average FPS 100-120 @ ultra settings Witcher 3 - 60 FPS on ultra settings. For some reason the FPS for this game are locked at 60 A Plague Tale: Innocence - 90-120 FPS on medium to ultra settings Forza Horizon 4 - did not have FPS enable at that time so could not see the actual FPS, but it looked great so I'll assume it was in the range mentioned above  I am planning to try out more games and will update my review accordingly. But so far I am happy with my purchase and can recommend this laptop to future buyers with confidence. Trackpad is quite awesome too, don't know though which driver it is using. Keyboard is great as well, but I use an external keyboard anyway so it does not matter to me. Speakers are satisfactory. They are placed at the bottom and deliver good sound both in terms of quality and loudness.  The device is surprisingly lightweight which is a good thing! Build quality could have been better, but it is definitely not fragile. Keyboard is white backlit only, so no RGB lighting available. I am not into the fancy RGB lighting so it does not bother me at all. I am also thankful that it does not come with red lighting on the keyboard!  Thank you Amazon for quick delivery (16 hours) and thank you Lenovo for this good product.  Edit: I forgot the mention that I played for three hours straight and did not experience any kind of performance throttling. Boot up is almost instant which is expected. Note that it comes with 1x 16GB RAM and my laptop came with WD SN530 SSD. You have one more slot for RAM and SSD each and I've read somewhere that the laptop can support NVMe Gen 4 SSDs, but not sure whether that's true.",POSITIVE
"It is a damn good and very nice price laptop. People were saying that it has battery drain issue, but I found it good. The Battery lasts around 5hrs in normal work including photoshop. The body is strong, design is good. I loved the display.  I was confused between the Infinix one and this one, but this one is much better as Lenovo has broader service area.",POSITIVE
"The power bank is a game-changer for on-the-go charging. Its high wattage easily powers laptops, smartphones, and tablets with fast charging capability. The compact design, multiple ports (including USB-C), and excellent battery capacity make it highly versatile. The built-in safety features provide peace of mind, and the LED display is handy for monitoring charge levels, it’s well worth it for the performance. Perfect for travelers or remote workers!",POSITIVE
"he Ambrane 85W Fast Charging Powerbank is an excellent product. Its 20,000mAh battery offers reliable backup for laptops, MacBooks, and smartphones. The triple output, Power Delivery, and Quick Charge features make charging fast and convenient. Highly recommended for its performance and versatility!",POSITIVE
"Pros 1. It's a good to go product and easy to carry. 2. Longer battery life and it is actually a 20000 mah power bank and it's performance is good 3. It supports fast charging upto 65W. ( I bought it for my smartphone so it's working fine with it but it is not supported in my laptop may be due to comparability or some other issues, I have not tried again) 4. Company gives you warranty but for it you have to register it online (that's a easy step)  Cons: 1. Its weight (though it's a 20000 mah powerbank so it is obvious it will some weight) 2. Slightly costly but no other product is available in market with such a good fast charging speed  So above mentioned concerns are not actually a big deal You can consider it if your mobile supports fast charging",NEGATIVE
Not charging,NEGATIVE
"Super-fast charging of any device - laptop, phone, tab, etc. Very good quality. My HP Elitebook charges to almost full charge in 30-40 mins. Does fast-charging of my Samsung A54.  Just bear in mind, using it for high-power devices like laptops will discharge the battery completely with a single charge of the device.  I also bought the Ambrane RAAP H65 charger which charges the powerbank fully in less than 2 hours. Heats up a bit when charging, but I guess that's normal.  Combining both, an excellent purchase.",POSITIVE
"Combability, design and especially value for money, power efficiency really good.",POSITIVE
Very brilliant product. It is having long duration power. Can be used whole day. Easy portability. Definitely you should buy it if your using Macbook.,POSITIVE
"The product is nice but one problem is it doesn't charge my tab on 45w speed it only charges it on 25w so if ur going to buy this for ur phone to charge it with its full 65w speed it will only charge it on 25w speed. One more thing is that the cable with powerbank is not of good quality, after using it for few days it's cable braiding is coming out. It's somewhat heavy and it's not so portable so if u want a portable device then don't buy this but if u want a big capacity then u should buy this. Thank youu!",NEGATIVE

"So 1st of all I got this laptop in 41000 during Amazon Great Indian festival.  Now about the laptop. I got this laptop delivered in 9 days which can be considered a ling period but fine by me.The outer box was damaged but inside it was all perfect, so no problem with that.I Don't think this will be a decision maker and please don't make it one  Looks amd design are the best , literally it looks cool and 14 inches make it most beautiful.  ok, now , before buying the laptop I saw many critics of display, but tbh yeah the display is not that ""oled or wuxga quality but as a student I have no problem,like it is pretty normal screen very normal,so if you have very high quality display needs then don't buy this but if you are student or evrn a working professional like me, so yeah the critics were somewhat right but its ok to be honest, it will do the job.  Now battery, now this one is tough to answer, I saw one comment which said 1 hr battery life, ohk yes the battery life is low, but not 1 hr, here is what I have found after using for 10 days:  2 hr battery: intense gaming (played honkai rail star, rocket league, genshin impact, can play valorant too)  3.5-4.5 hrs: Net surfing and video streaming  5hr-6 hr : pdf and book reading (which I as a student use it most for)  See it is a H grade processor,but it is okay guys, chill, it has fast charing too, but I don't use it, cuz yeah ""dell"" in its laptop says the battery health gets depleted,so it must be true for lenovo too.  Processor: It is i5 12th gen BUT a H GRADE , SO IT HAS GAMING CAPABILITY,I played games, it does the work but don't think you will give you performance like dedicated gpu) bit it is faster than 13th gen U processor (you can see the scores online), but yeah the battery life is low due to this only. So yeah again normal-normal.  Hardware is top notch, the keyboard quality is good.  So all in all it is very good laptop, it will get all your normal needs done, go for it ,you will get it in 45k in sale.",NEGATIVE
"Light weight easy to carry, good processor for day to day office work with home 11 and Ms office pre installed. Screen brightness is decent indoor but speaker is pathetic so not recommended for multimedia use case. If you want a laptop for office work with low budget below 50k go for it. I got it for 39k with bank office in great Indian sales and satisfied with it.",NEGATIVE
"Don't Buy this Product. Horrible Experience with Amazon and Lenovo.. - Within 10 days of purchase, display started showing horizontal lines. - Lenovo service center accepted it as hardware issue but they would only replace the part & not replacing the entire product.. This only means, they sent 2nd quality product/refurbished product which got issue within 10 days. Amazon is selling these kind of products online. - While Amazon Customer Service team tried helping but they couldn't get through replacing product as it crossed 7 days period. - Equally disappointed with both Amazon and Lenovo. Will have to be careful buying any electronic items from amazon going forward..",NEGATIVE

"Low battery backup, scratch on camera and fpoor quality camera, Sound is low , side viewing angles not satisfied, not value for money 😔 . Don't buy for 50k look for MacBook instead as heating issue, screen quality and speed will remain be an issue 😭. Also in MacBook you will be assured that you can use for atleast 8 years and also you will get proper updates from apple. Please 🙏 Don't buy.

"This laptop is best for students, who want to watch YouTube play some mid-tier games. You can also get HP Victus 16 laptop in this price segment, but it has some pros and cons in that comparison. Pros of Asus S15: 1. Display: 2.8k, Oled, 100%srgb, 600nits brightness(most phones comes with max 400nits, you can compare). 2. Intel Evo 3. Atleast 8hrs of battery on basic usage. 4. Highly intelligent fingerprint: (if you are turning on your PC with your registered fingerprint then it will directly log you in.) 5. Thunderbolt 4. 6. Light weight 1.7kgs. 7. 180deg hinge (it comes handy when you accidently push your screen back, most screen or hinges gets damages due to 120deg hinge) 8. I got this laptop for 84k, but while I'm writing this its 87k. 9. Aluminum back of the display.  Pros of HP Victus 16: 1. Processor: Ryzen 7 79840HS is more powerful than intel i5 13500H 2. Dedicated graphics with 6GB of RAM 3. LAN port with 1Gbps 5. 144hz display 6. Faster RAM 5600MHz vs 48MHz 7. SD card reader (Support SD/SDHC/SDxC) 8. Currently 16-s0095AX version is priced at 81k.  Both of this laptops are latest generation from their manufacturers. Both have DDR5. Both have 512 gen4 ssd.  So, if you are not a hardcore gamer or you are a student then you should go for Asus. Or if you are want to run CPU intensive program then you can go for HP Victus, because multicore performance is very high in this laptop.",NEGATIVE
Recently buy this laptop on 27/09/24 really happy to unbox it bt whin turn it on the screen was blank called customer service associate they told me that replacement is not available only service centre is the last option.in service centre they told me that it will takes 6-7 day if it will not repaired then u will get refund or replacement and not from our side u have to call amazon customer associate and then they arrange a pickup.this was really disappointing.i had saved money from last 6 month to buy a laptop after searching many laptop i found this to buy. Dont know this was happened.now waiting for my new refurbished laptop.😡😡😡😡,NEGATIVE
"Delivery is fast (within 3 days) but, open box delivery is not available for my product.  This is my second asus product after asus zenfone max pro m1 mobile.  First its blue colour attracts you.  1). Display is top category in this price segment.  It flickering during charging pin plug in and plug out but don't worry it is not any system defect. To stop it please change screen refresh rate option in my asus app from dynamic to static.  2) Battery is average upto 6 hours normal use. But fast charging is an advantage.  3) Keyboard is also good. Touch pad is a big one, support multi gesture.  4) Processor performance good. I play one 8k video on YouTube ,then it temperature gose to 90°c. It is best for watching upto 4k video. Cooling system is effective.  One thing it not supported windows face recognition as it have not ir camera.  Afterall it is best product in this price segment (Rs. 83990), but unfortunately I buy this at Rs. 86990.  Thank u.",POSITIVE

"Laptop is working good, but heating quickly and 68wh battery also not lasting for long. The average battery time is 3 to 4 hours for the average python program running. On the positive side, good speed, anti-glare screen, nice keypad and mouse track pad. Suitable for all type of works (considering the negatives mentioned above) Overall rating for this product is Above average. One cheating issue by Seller or Amazon: This product comes with the back to college offer. When I tried to register for it, the website is asking for the state (location) and the seller name. The seller Appario is not available in that HP offer claiming site. I dialed to Amazon to check about it, they asked me to wait for a minute and then they disconnected the call without a courtesy. So seller is cheating with this offer and Amazon is supporting the seller. It is too bad. I did not considered this bad experience in my rating star of 4/5. If I would have considered, my rating would be 2/5.",NEGATIVE

It seems like no matter how many times they try, nothing gets fixed. This ongoing problem has caused significant frustration, and the worst part is that I am losing valuable work hours and salary because I can't rely on this laptop to function properly.

"I recently purchased a renewed laptop from Amazon, and I must say that I am extremely disappointed with the product I received. The laptop I received was clearly much older than anticipated, estimated to be at least 4-5 years old. It had obviously been heavily used previously, with numerous changed parts that did not align with the original configuration.  One of the most disheartening aspects was the visible wear and tear on the laptop. It was evident that the laptop had been through extensive use, showing signs of physical damage and cosmetic flaws. It is quite frustrating to receive a product that does not meet the expected quality standards, especially considering it was marketed as ""renewed"" and sold on a reputable platform like Amazon.  Moreover, the fact that the laptop's parts had been replaced with components that did not match the original specifications added to my disappointment. As a customer, I expected a renewed laptop to be refurbished to a condition that closely resembles its original state, with compatible components and in line with the original design.  This experience has left me questioning the reliability of the renewed products sold on Amazon. I feel let down as a customer, as I had trusted the platform to provide a quality product that meets my expectations. This purchase has not only been a waste of my hard-earned money but has also caused a significant inconvenience as I now have to seek an alternative solution for my computing needs.  I hope that Amazon takes this feedback seriously and improves its quality control measures for renewed products. Customers should be able to trust that the products they purchase, even if renewed, are in proper working condition and aligned with the advertised specifications.  In conclusion, I strongly advise potential buyers to exercise caution when considering purchasing renewed laptops from Amazon. Based on my personal experience, I cannot recommend this particular product as it fell far short of my expectations in terms of age, condition, and adherence to the original configuration.",NEGATIVE

"I recently purchased this docking station for my Apple MacBook, and it has exceeded my expectations. Crafted from durable metal rather than plastic, it not only offers excellent build quality but also adds a sleek and premium look to my workspace. I primarily use it for office work rather than gaming, and the HDMI functionality works perfectly for my needs. It performs flawlessly, providing reliable connectivity and functionality. If you're looking for a stylish, sturdy, and dependable docking station, this is an excellent choice and a great value for the price. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE

The SD and Micro SD slots are a bonus for quickly transferring media files, especially for my photography needs.  What really sets this dock apart is how seamlessly it works with my MacBook and Thunderbolt 3 devices. It’s reliable, compact, and has made my workspace so much more efficient.

The Type-C connection is seamless, and it instantly transformed my laptop into a fully equipped workstation. Here’s what you get:  1. HDMI Port: The 4K HDMI output is a standout feature. It supports crystal-clear video output, making it perfect for presentations, video editing, or simply enjoying high-definition content on a larger screen. I’ve used it with my 4K monitor, and the experience has been flawless.  2. USB 3.0 Port: One USB 3.0 port and Two USB 2.0 ports are incredibly fast, allowing for quick data transfers. Whether it’s connecting my external hard drive, mouse, or keyboard, I’ve experienced zero lag or connectivity issues.  3. SD/TF Card Reader: The SD and TF card slots are a great addition for photographers and content creators. Transferring files from my camera’s SD card to my laptop has never been easier.  4. Type-C 100W Power Delivery: The Type-C port with 100W power delivery is a thoughtful feature. It allows me to charge my laptop while using the docking station, which eliminates the need for multiple chargers and keeps my workspace clutter-free.

"Great laptop. Delivered on time. First impressions - 1. Great build, lid is metal, sturdy and robust. 2. Looks good, handy, not that heavy.  Boot 1. First time gets booted with windows 11, start it up and do product registration pretty straight forward.  Linux 1. Obvious, booted it with ubuntu 22.04, got the FP drivers installed manually (again very straightforward) 2. I got the 8GB ram it works fine, but i have juiced it up with 16gb so total 24gb 3. 2 type c ports, all the ports ull ever need its built into the laptop. 4. Two external monitors works smooth along with built in screen 5. Keyboard is good, I really enjoy typing, tho it could have been little better. Yep its backlit works fine. 6. Battery backup is not that good, couple of hours I get with normal usage, charges quickly, but have to keep charger handy 7. On linux bluetooth and wifi gives you issues, which should be fixable with a usb wifi stick  Final thoughts After considering a lot of laptops, and specifically for linux, this one was a perfect match. you get 8 and 16gb variant go for 8 you get it for 48, I got it for 45 (with offers). Totally worth the money, and it truly is an amazing laptop. #thinkpad.",POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this 16-inch Lenovo laptop from Amazon and have had a mix of experiences. The fingerprint login is impressively fast, and the larger screen is a welcome upgrade from my previous 15.6-inch laptop. However, I've encountered some minor issues that might be deal-breakers for some. Pros: * Swift Fingerprint Login: The fingerprint sensor is quick and reliable. * Excellent Display: The larger screen offers a more immersive viewing experience. * Bright Backlight: The backlight is sufficiently bright for comfortable viewing in various lighting conditions. * Excellent Linux Compatibility: AMD's superior GPU drivers make this a great choice for Linux users. Cons: * Subpar Speaker Volume: The speakers are quite soft, making it difficult to hear audio clearly, especially in noisy environments. * Average Battery Life: The battery life is around 5 hours, which may not be sufficient for all-day use without a charger. * Touchpad Placement: The touchpad is slightly off-center, which might take some getting used to for some users. * Slight Backlight Bleed: There's a minor backlight bleed issue on the left bottom side, noticeable when viewing a black screen in full screen mode. Despite these drawbacks, this Lenovo laptop offers a decent overall experience, particularly for Linux users who appreciate a larger screen and fast fingerprint login. However, potential buyers should carefully consider the speaker volume, battery life, and touchpad placement before making a decision.",POSITIVE
"Nice product, value for money, speed, dunctionality",POSITIVE
"Super working, trust the seller and super product my parents marriage cd was working",POSITIVE
Excellent product. Like it very much,POSITIVE
"Got a defective product, got it replaced with another one, and even the second one turned out to be defective. It can read the CDs but can't write. If you'll try to write any CD, it will simply hang the PC and eject. It's not my PC issue, I have a high end PC and all other CD writers work fine.  Much better to spend some more money and buy reputed brands like HP",NEGATIVE
This is a superb product! I really love it; it’s extremely useful for restoring my old videos and files that are in CD format.,POSITIVE
Best product under this budget good fit in every pc,POSITIVE
"Does the job. USB wire is very small compared to other brands. Packing was very very normal, cd writing taking so much time. May be damaged. Will try to do again",NEGATIVE
"Good product, easy to use",POSITIVE
"I work from home, and I needed a stand that is light, sturdy, and portable. I have repurchased the product. The six angles provide the angle depending on different needs. It a worth every penny for me.",POSITIVE
"Laptop Elevation Stand Review  The laptop elevation stand offers excellent elevation, providing a comfortable viewing angle that greatly reduces strain on the neck and shoulders. Its lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, which is perfect for people who move between workspaces or need something portable.  For work-related tasks and media consumption, this stand works wonderfully. The elevated height helps with ergonomics, and it’s perfect for watching videos or attending online meetings. However, I’m not entirely sure if it’s ideal for gaming, as it doesn’t seem to have features specifically designed for cooling or long gaming sessions.  One concern is the durability of the grips on the holders. They work well initially to keep the laptop stable, but I’m not sure what the solution is if they wear out over time. It would be great if there were some guidance on how to replace or maintain these parts for long-term use.  Overall, it's a solid stand for general use, but there might be some doubts regarding its longevity and performance for more intense activities like gaming.",POSITIVE
It's a good product don't worry about the size because when I first opened it I thought it will break as it appears small in size than my laptop but it works perfectly fine and handles the weight of my laptop the quality is very good I will say it is value for money overall its a good product 👍,POSITIVE
"Perfect sturdy item, get the job done. Not very heavy, so it's easy to carry around",POSITIVE
"Inaccurate color, i orderedspace grey received some weird mix of blue and grey, definitely not space grey. The high adjustment is also not precisely done. We have to push the extensions sideways to properly fall into the height adjustment. Stability is ok and rubbers are good",NEGATIVE
"Lightweight, and quality also good. It successfully fulfills my need for the height adjustment of my laptop screen for eye level and I feel it's value for money",POSITIVE
Nice Product. Easy to use and sturdy.,POSITIVE
"Good, good material, easy to carry, price need to be 250",POSITIVE
Very cheap and flimsy. I have another one that was from office works that was well worth the extra money. Even the little rubbery bits on the bottom aren't placed correctly.,NEGATIVE
"Packs small and made of high quality materials. Elevates laptop from desk.  Problem- the locking at the angle isn't very secure so removing your laptop can cause it to collapse but if you don't plan on moving your laptop a lot, you should be good.",POSITIVE
Nice laptop with good performance and value for money having back-lit keyboard and many more features.,POSITIVE
"So,I am using this laptop from last 10days.. Here are some observations of mine:-  Display is decent at this price as evey other laptop provides. (4/5)  Camera is decent as aswell. 720p is not the best but good enough to attend video calls  Battery is really good because it comes with a 1215u processor. It will give you around 5hrs with 50% brightness or more . (5/5)  Build quality is really good, As most of the product of Asus .. (5/5)  Pro's:- -Good Battery life -Build Quality feels lika a premium laptop -Ms office - Backlit keyboard - single core performance is really good  Con's:- - fingerprints on the laptop will irritate you to clean it.. - Decent heavy task duty because of 1215u You can play gta 5 in low setting with decent fps...  *Best option for students, you'll never regret it*",POSITIVE
"I received this product on 05th October, but the sound of the system is very low and the performance without headphones is not satisfactory. Don't buy this product.",NEGATIVE
"I gave 5 star coz it was a smooth sailing after purchase, 3 months ago. Laptop is excellent for media streaming, and office work. I don't play games or do heavy editing. But over-all this laptop feels premium and will not let u down for the price-tag.",POSITIVE
Worth every rupee. The best specs at this price range (36000 Rs - 39000 Rs). Avg Battery life is about 3.5 hrs. Free MS Office. Speakers are average. Display quality is good at this price range. Valorant can run smoothly with low graphics at avg of 80 fps. Best for students. ( Not for editing and advanced coding ),POSITIVE
"Pros : Size : 15.6 inch fast new generation quad core processor having great security. Looks are awesome 👍 Old windows 11 version 22h2 is provided you have to update it to work smoothly. Graphics processor is as strong as i5 11 th gen G series iris xe. Necessary USB ports are provided. Battery backup is good but depends usage MS office 2021 is provided and McAfee subscription 2 years. Sound is good.  Cons :  Only one major con is its display. Display is not good. It is LCD not IPS. In today's time,Atleast IPS panel display is necessary. Backlit KB is provided but Fingerprint not provided.  Finally no Heating issue. Outdated softwares,Drivers are the major contributors of heating. So be sure to update every software before start using it.",POSITIVE
Looks are good of this pc.College goers can use this for professional use. Very light gaming can be done. Value for money below ₹32k. All other laptops are of low specs around this range.,NEGATIVE
Its not charging and bad condition of the box also not working I want an refund,NEGATIVE

How to enable and on back light keyboard for this model? Unable to figure it out otherwise overall good laptop,NEGATIVE
I liked everything about this product and the Service of asus is great as well. Loved this laptop and It's my first laptop so plus points,POSITIVE
"I recently purchased this laptop for my sister as she started her college journey, and it has proven to be a great choice!  For its price, this laptop delivers solid performance. It handles everyday tasks like note-taking, browsing, and streaming lectures smoothly. While it may not be a powerhouse for heavy gaming or complex design software, it’s more than sufficient for a typical college student’s needs.  The laptop is lightweight and easy to carry, which is a big plus for a student constantly on the move between classes. The sleek design adds a professional touch, and it looks more expensive than it actually is.  The battery life is commendable—lasting long enough to get through a full day of classes without needing a charge, depending on usage.  Overall, this laptop is a fantastic student-friendly option that balances performance and affordability. If you're looking for a dependable device for college, this is a great pick!",POSITIVE
Works as advertised! The included MS office was the clincher. Using for two weeks now! Cannot complain!,POSITIVE
"The product is running like as a refurbished is sent. The return is an harrowing experience, amazon making promises everyday but not taking back. Even the physical inspection was marked as done without anyone visiting to check and return.",NEGATIVE
Very good and easily uses product nice👍,POSITIVE
"1: Design is good. I bought the one with 14 Inch and it was damn beautiful.  2: Keyboard has backlit.  3: Processor, configuration is very nice - i3 core 12th gen, 8GB RAM, 512 GB SSD  4: Sound is nice  5: Screen can be improved. The colors are little distracted and too whitish. The screen panel could have been better. However, considering the price I will say it works.  6: It has Microsoft Office 21  7: Setting up is easy (ensure a good internet connection)  8: Price - I got it at INR 32190.  9: No fingerprint sensor  10: weight is decent, not too heavy considering you choose 14 Inch version.",POSITIVE

"This Lanovo laptop looks fine. But i have a major concern that I purchased this in last week of December 2024 and so my warranty of one year should be valid till December 2025, but it is showing that warranty started in July 2024. I need help and support on this issue.",NEGATIVE
"Even though the Microsoft Office package was supposed to be included with the laptop, as informed at the time of purchase, it was not included. This is very disappointing.",NEGATIVE
"You just can’t go wrong with mac, it’s amazing",POSITIVE
"I recently bought the Apple MacBook Air M2 from Amazon, and I’m extremely satisfied with my purchase. The laptop was delivered on time, and the packaging was secure and well-handled, ensuring it arrived in perfect condition. The MacBook Air M2 is fast, lightweight, and has an impressive battery life. The display is crisp and vibrant, and the performance is smooth for everyday tasks and even some intensive work. The fanless design keeps it silent, and the build quality feels premium. Overall, I highly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a powerful yet portable device. Great experience with Amazon’s service as well!",POSITIVE
"Got hands to MLXY3HN/A model, though not through Amazon. The M2 8GB 256GB was not available in Amazon but got a steal deal for 67490 INR in Flipkart. The product is amazing & upgraded from M1 2020 to M2 2022. The performance, display, speed, battery and everything is topnotch. There are only two things which I didn't like, but nothing related to performance. One, I ordered midnight black thinking that it will be a nice pure black colour, but it is a lot of bluish and not black. Second, the case finishing is prone to retain fingerprints easily and leaves a lot of marks of the body when you casually touch it.",POSITIVE
Unable to work. Laptop key automatically type. Very worst experience.,NEGATIVE
"Good Spec, Better Performance & Battery Backup, Compactness",POSITIVE
"So 1st of all I got this laptop in 41000 during Amazon Great Indian festival.  Now about the laptop. I got this laptop delivered in 9 days which can be considered a ling period but fine by me.The outer box was damaged but inside it was all perfect, so no problem with that.I Don't think this will be a decision maker and please don't make it one  Looks amd design are the best , literally it looks cool and 14 inches make it most beautiful.  ok, now , before buying the laptop I saw many critics of display, but tbh yeah the display is not that ""oled or wuxga quality but as a student I have no problem,like it is pretty normal screen very normal,so if you have very high quality display needs then don't buy this but if you are student or evrn a working professional like me, so yeah the critics were somewhat right but its ok to be honest, it will do the job.  Now battery, now this one is tough to answer, I saw one comment which said 1 hr battery life, ohk yes the battery life is low, but not 1 hr, here is what I have found after using for 10 days:  2 hr battery: intense gaming (played honkai rail star, rocket league, genshin impact, can play valorant too)  3.5-4.5 hrs: Net surfing and video streaming  5hr-6 hr : pdf and book reading (which I as a student use it most for)  See it is a H grade processor,but it is okay guys, chill, it has fast charing too, but I don't use it, cuz yeah ""dell"" in its laptop says the battery health gets depleted,so it must be true for lenovo too.  Processor: It is i5 12th gen BUT a H GRADE , SO IT HAS GAMING CAPABILITY,I played games, it does the work but don't think you will give you performance like dedicated gpu) bit it is faster than 13th gen U processor (you can see the scores online), but yeah the battery life is low due to this only. So yeah again normal-normal.  Hardware is top notch, the keyboard quality is good.  So all in all it is very good laptop, it will get all your normal needs done, go for it ,you will get it in 45k in sale.",NEGATIVE
"Light weight easy to carry, good processor for day to day office work with home 11 and Ms office pre installed. Screen brightness is decent indoor but speaker is pathetic so not recommended for multimedia use case. If you want a laptop for office work with low budget below 50k go for it. I got it for 39k with bank office in great Indian sales and satisfied with it.",NEGATIVE
"Don't Buy this Product. Horrible Experience with Amazon and Lenovo.. - Within 10 days of purchase, display started showing horizontal lines. - Lenovo service center accepted it as hardware issue but they would only replace the part & not replacing the entire product.. This only means, they sent 2nd quality product/refurbished product which got issue within 10 days. Amazon is selling these kind of products online. - While Amazon Customer Service team tried helping but they couldn't get through replacing product as it crossed 7 days period. - Equally disappointed with both Amazon and Lenovo. Will have to be careful buying any electronic items from amazon going forward..",NEGATIVE
Very bad screen quality and viewing angle,NEGATIVE
After using it for a day - Display : pretty good Speakers - Below average Battery life - Good Camera - Good Performed well in dead pixel and keyboard functionality test. Overall amazing laptop for the price .....,POSITIVE
Does my job without any hiccups. Happy with the purchase.,POSITIVE
Quality and functionality is smooth. Seems best product and got it for 40k during the sale. Battery life is good. Camera quality and sound is just Ok.,POSITIVE
Great laptop wonderful performance UI is very friendly design in so unique smoothness is wow battery is ok and weight is very surpriseing heavy,POSITIVE
"Edit: DONT BE FOOLED BY 2 RAM SLOTS  IT CAN TAKE A MAX IF 16GB RAM. SO THE ONLY UPGRADE POSSIBLE FOR THE 1x16GB MODEL IS CHANGING IT TO DUAL CHANNEL 2x8GB.  Found out the hard and sad way, also confirmed with Lenovo.  Old:  The other review covers it very well, it will run whatever you throw at it.  I left Red Dead Redemption 2 running for 20 hours straight. resumed playing still ran like butter.  It comes with 2nd NVME slot but no screw so you'll have to procure it separately.  Others count lack of RGB as a con, but I'll say White looks professional, wich goes with the overall look of the laptop, making it suitable for use in professional environments if you don't want everyone around you knowing you're a gamer.  not being able to charge via the USB C is understandable with 170 W in the adaptor.  90W TDP is boost TPG it will show lower but boosts it to 90W. remains cool without throttling even for longer heavy workloads, hint 20hours of RDR2.  I recommend buying a 2nd NVME along with your purchase as you'll run out of 500 gigs quick. The included disk is a WD BLue SN530, not the best but good performance, not something you'll find slow in your daily usage unless your work is copying > 200 gig everyday.  2Gig of the 16GB included ram go to VRAM .",NEGATIVE
"I bought the 24gb ram, i7 13th nvidia 4050 version. The performance is stellar. I enabled windows ultimate performance in power management options from cmd. I also updated the bios using Lenovo website as the system was prompting the same. The gaming is butter smooth. Temperature management is also very good. I take breaks between 1.5 hour rounds by shutting off the computer when the fan noise peaks. Easily a powerhorse. Lenovo vantage is also very useful in managing power requirements and fan noise. Be sure to remove the paper cover on the charger and keep the charger standing on the long edge/side. Being a laptop it is also advisable to play on full charge with plugged on set up. Keyboard and trackpad are also very very professional. Display is ok ok. For 94000 this is a good gaming plus professional laptop.",POSITIVE
"I bought this laptop and upon 100% charging, it gets drained within 3 hours if laptop remains idle, drains within one and half hour if you are watching a YouTube video or using multiple excel files. If you are playing games then it barely lasts till an hour. Very very bad battery life. It is complete waste of money.",NEGATIVE
"Bought it for price 78k on December 2023. Have been using it for 8 months. Most of the modern AAA titles run at 1080p 60fps. The screen refresh rate is 165Hz, which if bought separately costs a lot.  The CPU has 8 cores and 16 Threads, which is enough for any programming, rendering, compilation or virtualization. The Ryzen 7 5800H also has a RX Vega 8 APU graphics which can be used for encoding while streaming, while your main game runs on RTX 3060  I have tested linux on it as well, after disabling secure boot, and installing Nvidia drivers for Nvidia optimus also works and is hassle free.  The only cons might be both the USB ports being on the right side. And the battery-life, but that is to be expected of any gaming laptop.",NEGATIVE
"So this is my second gaming laptop, first one being the Legion Y520 (i5 7th gen, GTX 1050). That laptop lasted 6 years for me and is currently being used by my sister.  Few reasons why I opted for this laptop in particular: CPU and GPU combination - Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3060 @90W TDP Display - 165Hz, 100% SRGB Price: Got it for 89,990  Originally I wanted the MSI Alpha 15 Advantage edition that has the same CPU, but comes with 8GB Radeon 6600M. It was slightly expensive and delivery by Flipkart was quite slow for my address, so I didn't go for it. There were 2 other options from MSI that have RTX 3060 and shipped with i7 CPU, but they did not have color accurate displays (45% color gamut). For these reasons Ideapad gaming 3 became the perfect pick for me and I am impressed with my purchase. Boot times are of course great and games load significantly fast, of course. I am planning to add a 1TB SSD and additional 16GB RAM later which will improve the performance even further!  Following games have been tested by me so far on ultra to medium settings: World of Warships - average FPS 100-120 @ ultra settings Witcher 3 - 60 FPS on ultra settings. For some reason the FPS for this game are locked at 60 A Plague Tale: Innocence - 90-120 FPS on medium to ultra settings Forza Horizon 4 - did not have FPS enable at that time so could not see the actual FPS, but it looked great so I'll assume it was in the range mentioned above  I am planning to try out more games and will update my review accordingly. But so far I am happy with my purchase and can recommend this laptop to future buyers with confidence. Trackpad is quite awesome too, don't know though which driver it is using. Keyboard is great as well, but I use an external keyboard anyway so it does not matter to me. Speakers are satisfactory. They are placed at the bottom and deliver good sound both in terms of quality and loudness.  The device is surprisingly lightweight which is a good thing! Build quality could have been better, but it is definitely not fragile. Keyboard is white backlit only, so no RGB lighting available. I am not into the fancy RGB lighting so it does not bother me at all. I am also thankful that it does not come with red lighting on the keyboard!  Thank you Amazon for quick delivery (16 hours) and thank you Lenovo for this good product.  Edit: I forgot the mention that I played for three hours straight and did not experience any kind of performance throttling. Boot up is almost instant which is expected. Note that it comes with 1x 16GB RAM and my laptop came with WD SN530 SSD. You have one more slot for RAM and SSD each and I've read somewhere that the laptop can support NVMe Gen 4 SSDs, but not sure whether that's true.",POSITIVE
"It is a damn good and very nice price laptop. People were saying that it has battery drain issue, but I found it good. The Battery lasts around 5hrs in normal work including photoshop. The body is strong, design is good. I loved the display.  I was confused between the Infinix one and this one, but this one is much better as Lenovo has broader service area.",POSITIVE
"The power bank is a game-changer for on-the-go charging. Its high wattage easily powers laptops, smartphones, and tablets with fast charging capability. The compact design, multiple ports (including USB-C), and excellent battery capacity make it highly versatile. The built-in safety features provide peace of mind, and the LED display is handy for monitoring charge levels, it’s well worth it for the performance. Perfect for travelers or remote workers!",POSITIVE
"he Ambrane 85W Fast Charging Powerbank is an excellent product. Its 20,000mAh battery offers reliable backup for laptops, MacBooks, and smartphones. The triple output, Power Delivery, and Quick Charge features make charging fast and convenient. Highly recommended for its performance and versatility!",POSITIVE
"Pros 1. It's a good to go product and easy to carry. 2. Longer battery life and it is actually a 20000 mah power bank and it's performance is good 3. It supports fast charging upto 65W. ( I bought it for my smartphone so it's working fine with it but it is not supported in my laptop may be due to comparability or some other issues, I have not tried again) 4. Company gives you warranty but for it you have to register it online (that's a easy step)  Cons: 1. Its weight (though it's a 20000 mah powerbank so it is obvious it will some weight) 2. Slightly costly but no other product is available in market with such a good fast charging speed  So above mentioned concerns are not actually a big deal You can consider it if your mobile supports fast charging",NEGATIVE
Not charging,NEGATIVE
"Super-fast charging of any device - laptop, phone, tab, etc. Very good quality. My HP Elitebook charges to almost full charge in 30-40 mins. Does fast-charging of my Samsung A54.  Just bear in mind, using it for high-power devices like laptops will discharge the battery completely with a single charge of the device.  I also bought the Ambrane RAAP H65 charger which charges the powerbank fully in less than 2 hours. Heats up a bit when charging, but I guess that's normal.  Combining both, an excellent purchase.",POSITIVE
"Combability, design and especially value for money, power efficiency really good.",POSITIVE
Very brilliant product. It is having long duration power. Can be used whole day. Easy portability. Definitely you should buy it if your using Macbook.,POSITIVE
"The product is nice but one problem is it doesn't charge my tab on 45w speed it only charges it on 25w so if ur going to buy this for ur phone to charge it with its full 65w speed it will only charge it on 25w speed. One more thing is that the cable with powerbank is not of good quality, after using it for few days it's cable braiding is coming out. It's somewhat heavy and it's not so portable so if u want a portable device then don't buy this but if u want a big capacity then u should buy this. Thank youu!",NEGATIVE
"Everything is mind blowing, excellent, flawless product.But one thing is its battery.I won't play game in this laptop.I bought for my multitasking,still I am not satisfied with the battery.Only one day without playing game.",NEGATIVE
Overall very good laptop with good processor and GPU but battery backup only 1-2 hours,NEGATIVE
I am unable to register warranty as per given instructions.  I tried many time following each step but it didn't work,NEGATIVE
Good product,POSITIVE
It has polycarbonate build yet still it seems durable. But I'm having issue in windows updates that are required while setting up the pc. Other than that performance and display are good. Display doesn't have any screen bleeding which is better than Vivobook 16x. It's totally value for money.,POSITIVE
"HP Victus: Powerful, sleek gaming laptop at a great price! Exceeded my expectations in performance, thermals, and battery life. Highly recommend! Been using this last 2 months now.",POSITIVE

"Recently purchased the HP laptop during the Great India Festival sale, and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations. The build quality is top-notch, with a sleek design that is both stylish and durable. The performance is incredible—thanks to its powerful processor and 12GB RAM, it handles multitasking effortlessly and runs all my applications smoothly. The display is vibrant and anti glare, making both work and entertainment a joy. Battery life is excellent, lasting me 4-5 hrs of heavy use which is quite better compare to other laptop in this segmenr. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this HP laptop to anyone in need of a reliable, high-performance device!",POSITIVE
A very Nice and fast Laptop with intel Ultra 5-125H processor. Sound could have more in this laptop. Good for students and professionals. whole body metallic except base.300 nits brightness. No Arc graphics in this model .Arc Graphics with hp 1099tu model; useful for gaming which i don't need.,NEGATIVE
"Please check this model number on Asus website: GU605MI-QP253WS  It's an IPS screen, not OLED. Customers beware. It's price is touching sky, customers can't and shouldn't jump that high to get this fake product, which is impersonating as OLED laptop.",NEGATIVE

"Pros : 1.Design is good, display is good Cons : 1. in 15 min laptop got heated too much 2. Speaker Sound quality is too low and bad 3. Battery back only 3hrs 4. Boot time is 16 sec which is not for i5 12gen processor, should be 8 sec.",NEGATIVE
Battery drain is the only issue. Rest it is a fantastic laptop with premium build.,POSITIVE
"Value for money product. Main con is battery life ,as common as all other gaming laptop & one more con is sound 🫤 ( in vantage software we can adjust sound quality as we want but still it’s not loud and no base) Build quality is best and feels solid 👍  Combination of i5 cpu and arc a530m gpu gives laptop best speed and good performance  Best display over every laptop in this budget, no colour shift at all.  But arc a530m gpu doesn’t compete with rtx 3050, but better thn 2050 Overall worthy of every buck except sound and battery life.",POSITIVE
I was quietly impressed with this LOQ series.. Holding the box for first time doesn't feels like a gaming laptop 💻 . Having such a powerful processor and graphics card the weight of laptop is really nice . I played Gta 5 for around 1 2 hours in this case the laptop doesn't heat to much and also fan noise are not to loud. Lenevo really making this series looks like legion . Appreciate it lenevo.,POSITIVE
Here I bought 512GB SSD and when laptop is delivered it has 474GB SSD,NEGATIVE
"Using the laptop for 2 days. Awesome screen and looks premium. The keyboard is good. Got it for 48k in sale. The power back up is very poor which is only disadvantage I observed. The sound is very low. Many people complained MOBO. Will update after few weeks After a week of use, I loved everything about this laptop. Found no problem. Using this mostly for office work and entertainment. In batter save mode got 3.5hrs. in normal mode, hardly getting 1.5 to 2 hrs. In rapid charging mode, charged fully within 1 hr, which is quite good for me. Main drawbacks are sound, which is very low even in full volume, not good for people who watches movies and stuff in laptop. The camera quality is below par, totally disappointed with camera.",NEGATIVE
"The laptop is as good as I thought. No issues, no problem. I am an occasional gamer, so for me, it's good. And video editing is smooth. I don't know why people complaint about sound, the sound is satisfactory. The display is top notch and battery life is also good (approx 4 hrs on 100% charge). Makes no noise. Built quality is royal. Loved it.",POSITIVE
Best gaming laptop under 60k Nice built quality Bad battery backup Sound quality not bad but not good Performance overall good Speed nice Brightness best,POSITIVE
"It is a mid range laptop ,sound quality is superb, but its comes with low volume . Display:It comes with 300nits .Its excellent experience gives to user. Keyboard keys: very good key travel is superb,respond time also good. Track pad: very smooth response is good. Web cam :it is comes with 720p quality. Overall rating : I give 4out of 5 .",POSITIVE
"After using for more than a month...  Pros -  This is the best for its price. Awesome build quality.  GPU temp doesnt exceeds 70°C even after playing for more than 3 hours continuously.  Can run all modern games at high settings easily. Even though rtx 4050 is at 45w , its actually somehow a plus point for it as it helps maintains better temperature overall increasing its life. No lags in games so far. Battery life is also good for a gaming laptop, can run for more than 3-4 hours unplugged doing basic work.  Keyboard is also good, just buy a separate mouse for gaming.  Speakers are ok.. sound quality is also ok. Not that loud.  Cons  Poor camera lol, but does it even matter? Display is average but good enough for daily task and gaming.",POSITIVE
"This MSI Laptop has a great performance and value for the price – as it handles gaming and my IT coding related wok smoothly, though battery life could be better for long sessions on the go.",POSITIVE
"The only reasons it doesn't get 5 star is its TGP, powering at 45W, which is underclocked af compared to other laptops and the backlit kb is not customizable, it is fixed. But overall, it's a decent laptop with great built quality.",POSITIVE

The laptop is awesome i7 12th Gen and RTX 4060 8GB GDDR6 graphics are really giving me happy tears sure it runs on 45W TGP but I don’t find any problem with that I tested my favourite games(Valorant/God of War/AC Valhalla/Cyberpunk 2077/Elden Ring) and they all run smooth as butter. The processing is smooth too faster loading screens were my nightmare and not anymore. The MSI centre is really helpful if you want to optimise games and enable/disable some annoying options like accidentally moving touchpad when playing esports games we can disable this option in MSI centre. Overall I give 5 star rating as I bought this laptop within my budget and I’m happy that I bought it! No regrets.,POSITIVE
Nice laptop,POSITIVE
"Worst laptop at this price point. No extra slot for hdd/ssd upgrade, only 2 usb slots, no nvidia optimus, no thunderbolt port, worst battery",NEGATIVE

"The infinix device arrived in a great condition, sports a very nice looking form factor and matches the specs. It has been easy to setup, works well with linux and has great performance.  Infinix will be my go to choice for any devices I purchase in future.",POSITIVE
"For the pricing this laptop is exceptional. It works much better than my expectations. U will see many people comaparing it with gaming laptops, see this is a thin and Light Laptop made for multitasking and productivity uses, and with the i9 it still can handle many good games. There are a few minor things like thermals which could be better, and the charger also could be a bit more nicer, but still overall it's a great package. And about customer care now many new centre's are available and each laptop has a qr with the center information",POSITIVE
This is low quality product. And customer care of infinix is worst. They will give ill excuseswhen you reach them for any warrenty issue. Not suggest to buy!!,NEGATIVE
"There's a trackpad issue and after searching for days i found that's it's not me but everyone else as well that's facing the issue, but i never use it and i use a mouse which is way better other than that must buy everything works great and i recently installed another 1TB SSD which works even better with the total of 2TB",NEGATIVE
Specs wise it is hansome on paper. Fulfills all necessary ticks. Battery life is good if not best . Charger has merits and cons. Merit is dedicated charging port saves one type c usb. Con is old school bric. Some wobble in display but manageable. Try not to purchase from Flipkart because now days they try to increase there profit only. They never properly address customer concern. In future also try to purchase from Amazon only cause it is most customer centric company as per my own experience with quality customer care services. One thing to mention about this laptop is software and driver support is very poor. So if you can manage with it . Go blind with this book.,NEGATIVE
It is a premium laptop with high performance. Value for money. Price is little high in Amazon where others are selling at lower price.,POSITIVE
"I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:  Pros:  - Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences. - Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay. - Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips. - Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use. - Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.  Cons:  - Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check. - Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.  Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.  Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.  Rating Breakdown:  - Performance: 5/5 - Display: 5/5 - Battery Life: 4.5/5 - Design: 4.5/5 - Value: 5/5  Would I recommend it? Absolutely!",POSITIVE
"I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition. Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.  Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)  The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.  The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.  Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.",NEGATIVE
"Hi guys, Here is my review after using this laptop.  Laptop pro's - Design, price and performance.  Laptop design - This laptop's design feels premium and nice.  Laptop performance - It can handle GTA 5 smoothly. Also can record gameplay.  Laptop thermals - Laptop gets hot only during gaming. But it doesn't over heat as far as I used.  Laptop con's - I noticed some bugs/glitches like cursor while using in typing area or text box it gets white or kinda invisible I feel this maybe a bug.  -Screen goes off for a second sometimes while playing videos or browsing especially in battery power.  -Blue screen error: I have faced blue screen error two times till now while switching from power mode to battery mode(plugging out adapter).",NEGATIVE
"I bought an Asus TUF GAMING 15 from amazon on 16/10/2024. After 5 days it had many problems (it suddenly shut down, I thought the battery must have run out, so I charged the laptop and turned it on (it turned on after 5 minutes and the battery was still 40%) and after 1 hour windows crashed and after 1 day windows crashed 3 times, and keyboard light is not working properly ,then I sent it for replacement and AMAZON people said that the tech technician would visit on 27/10/2024 but the technician did not come on the 27th, I contacted Amazon on 1st Nov, they said that your product will be refunded, the DELHIVERY agent will pick up your product on 2nd Nov, but they are not picked my product PLEASE REFUND ME MY MONEY",NEGATIVE
"This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc... Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful. Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card. Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a ""battery care mode"" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!! This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!! Top notch 5/5 stars!!!",POSITIVE
"Best quality,even after 5 hour gaming no Heat , display quality is excellent , very smooth, value for money,the only issue is battery 🔋 backup is low",POSITIVE
"I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpad",POSITIVE
"Its so frustrating DEAR AMAZON CUSTOMER CARE & HP SUPPORT TEAM!!!!  Apart from hardware specifications, 2 main reasons why I purchased this laptop was 1. It comes with pre-installed MS office 2. There is redemption offer available  Pre-installed MS office After I received the laptop I realized that MS office is not installed on this machine.  Level 1 - I reached to HP customer care, they did some troubleshooting. Finally they told I have to reach to Microsoft for MS office license. I DON’T UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH MICROSOFT. ISN’T IT THE CASE THAT HP NEED TO ENSURE THE PROMISED SOFTWARE IS PRESENT IN LAPTOP BEFORE IS WAS SOLD OUT?  Level 2 – Fine, I reached to Microsoft Office. They checked the invoice, in the invoice the Microsoft Office version wasn’t clearly mentioned. They asked me to request HP to issue a duplicate invoice mentioning MS Office 2021 in it.  Level 3 – I came back to HP informing what Microsoft told me. But HP denied saying they can’t give the invoice with that specification, so they asked to reach to Amazon as I bought the laptop through Amazon.  Level 4 – I reached to Amazon. Amazon executive didn’t even understand what I am requesting and simply told updated invoice can’t be generated  Level 5 and above – After that I have been following up with HP almost everyday. Everyday they tried to follow same steps and asked for same details. Its been one week now, finally today I got a call stating I have to go to MS team now asking for license, which means I am back to LEVEL 1 again  HP Redemption offer: Level 1 - This is second reason I considered this laptop. I applied for redemption and it was kept on hold, stating I need to get an invoice with Laptop serial number mentioned in it  Level 2 – I called Amazon and submitted a request, Amazon executive told I need to wait for 48 hours. I waited for 48 hours, I didn’t get any update I received from Amazon, then I called Amazon again. This time Amazon executive told there are no such requests in their system so they will submit a new one and this time I need to wait for 7 days…. WOW!!!!! Anyways I asked him to submit a new request  Level 3 – I called Amazon today again just to check the status of my request. This time same reply. THERE ARE NO SUCH REQUESTS IN TH SYSTEM. WOWWWWWWWW!!! Again same dialogue – I need to wait for 4 to 6 working days. This redemption is for limited period and I started losing hope that I will be getting those offers redeemed with the greatest level of support from our AMAZON EXECUTIVES!!!!",NEGATIVE
Am a first year btech student and this is an amazing laptop. It's best for me. It's speed and lightweight are most attractive features. But the sound is not loud.,POSITIVE

"Hello, i have been using this laptop for 7 days now. It has some good features and some bad ones. This laptop firstly came with an intel core i3 12th gen processor which has a quite good reputation. This computer is very butter smooth multitasking laptop. It has 8GB of Ram which makes the laptop capable to run multiple apps and chrome tab without any hassle, it doesn't take much time to open chrome. This computer aslo has a NVMe 512GB SSD, i love how they added this SSD to make the laptop faster, the boot time of this laptop is less than 9 seconds (depending on how may applications are installed). It is a very fast SSD in your budget (i think). The battery backup is kinda good, it keeps your laptop on the go for almost 10 hours without its charger (depending on what you are doing on the laptop). This laptop is equipped with Intel UHD 780 graphics with 4GB VRAM which makes the laptop capable of mid video editing and photo editing without hassle. Asking about gaming, I played Tom Clancy's The Divisions, GTA V on this, i got almost smooth 60fps on 720p lowest settings. Since i told the good side of it. Here are some drawbacks of this laptop. This laptop have poor sound quality like the volume is too low for me i think. That's all...",NEGATIVE

Excellent,POSITIVE
Core i3 suitable for moderate use. Good build and enough connectors on either side. Very cost competitive.,POSITIVE
Received the laptop yesterday only. The Display type is not mentioned any where in the products specification page in amazon. Its an TFT display with narrow viewing angles. however the display looks crisp when looking from front. Sound volume is very low cannot be used for video conferencing or attending class if there is ambient noise around. Otherwise the laptop feels preppy and fast. On the software side the laptop lacks MS office license which have to be purchase separately. Better to go for laptops that come with MSO.,NEGATIVE

Low budget high performance nice display smoothness to use,POSITIVE

The laptop is nice but not that good. I was expecting more than nice. The laptop has few major problems. Camera is one of them. Camera is definitely not a full HD. I mean I was disappointed by camera clarity. I have been using laptop from last 4 days. Battery is also an issue. It charges faster but. Battery drain is an issue in this laptop. Performance is nice. This is my opinion. After using this laptop for 4 days.,NEGATIVE
"Since first day i am facing wifi adapter problem, My internet is getting disconnected after few seconds.
